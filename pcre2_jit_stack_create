PCRE2_JIT_STACK_CREATE(3)  Library Functions Manual  PCRE2_JIT_STACK_CREATE(3)

NAME
       PCRE2 - Perl-compatible regular expressions (revised API)

SYNOPSIS

       #include <pcre2.h>

       pcre2_jit_stack *pcre2_jit_stack_create(PCRE2_SIZE startsize,
         PCRE2_SIZE maxsize, pcre2_general_context *gcontext);

DESCRIPTION

       This function is used to create a stack for use by the code compiled by
       the JIT compiler. The first two arguments are a starting size  for  the
       stack, and a maximum size to which it is allowed to grow. The final ar‐
       gument is a general context, for memory allocation functions,  or  NULL
       for  standard  memory  allocation.  The result can be passed to the JIT
       run-time code by  calling  pcre2_jit_stack_assign()  to  associate  the
       stack  with  a  compiled  pattern,  which  can  then  be  processed  by
       pcre2_match() or pcre2_jit_match().  A maximum stack size of 512KiB  to
       1MiB  should be more than enough for any pattern. If the stack couldn't
       be allocated or the values passed were not reasonable, NULL will be re‐
       turned. For more details, see the pcre2jit page.

       There is a complete description of the PCRE2 native API in the pcre2api
       page and a description of the POSIX API in the pcre2posix page.
