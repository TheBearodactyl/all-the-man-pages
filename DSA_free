NAME
       DSA_new, DSA_free - allocate and free DSA objects

SYNOPSIS
        #include <openssl/dsa.h>

       The following functions have been deprecated since OpenSSL 3.0, and can be hidden entirely by defining OPENSSL_API_COMPAT with a suitable version value, see openssl_user_macros(7):

        DSA* DSA_new(void);

        void DSA_free(DSA *dsa);

DESCRIPTION
       All of the functions described on this page are deprecated.  Applications should instead use EVP_PKEY_new(3) and EVP_PKEY_free(3).

       DSA_new() allocates and initializes a DSA structure. It is equivalent to calling DSA_new_method(NULL).

       DSA_free() frees the DSA structure and its components. The values are erased before the memory is returned to the system.  If dsa is NULL nothing is done.

RETURN VALUES
       If the allocation fails, DSA_new() returns NULL and sets an error code that can be obtained by ERR_get_error(3). Otherwise it returns a pointer to the newly allocated structure.

       DSA_free() returns no value.

SEE ALSO
       EVP_PKEY_new(3), EVP_PKEY_free(3), DSA_new(3), ERR_get_error(3), DSA_generate_parameters(3), DSA_generate_key(3)

HISTORY
       All of these functions were deprecated in OpenSSL 3.0.
