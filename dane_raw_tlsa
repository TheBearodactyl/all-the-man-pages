NAME
       dane_raw_tlsa - API function

SYNOPSIS
       #include <gnutls/dane.h>

       int dane_raw_tlsa(dane_state_t s, dane_query_t * r, char *const * dane_data, const int * dane_data_len, int secure, int bogus);

ARGUMENTS
       dane_state_t s
                   The DANE state structure

       dane_query_t * r
                   A structure to place the result

       char *const * dane_data
                   array of DNS rdata items, terminated with a NULL pointer; caller must guarantee that the referenced data remains valid until dane_query_deinit() is called.

       const int * dane_data_len
                   the length n bytes of the dane_data items

       int secure  true if the result is validated securely, false if validation failed or the domain queried has no security info

       int bogus   if the result was not secure (secure = 0) due to a security failure, and the result is due to a security failure, bogus is true.

DESCRIPTION
       This function will fill in the TLSA (DANE) structure from the given raw DNS record data. The  dane_data must be valid during the lifetime of the query.
