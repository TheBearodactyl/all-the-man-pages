NAME
       TIFFFieldReadCount - get number of values to be read from field

SYNOPSIS
          #include <tiffio.h>

       int TIFFFieldReadCount(const TIFFField *fip)

DESCRIPTION
       TIFFFieldReadCount()  returns  the number of values available to be read from the specified TIFF field; that is, the number of arguments that should be supplied to TIFFGetField().  For most field
       types this is a small positive integer, typically 1 or 2, but there are some special values:

       • TIFF_VARIABLE = -1 indicates that a variable number of values is possible; then, a uint16_t count argument and a pointer data argument must be supplied to TIFFGetField().

       • TIFF_VARIABLE2 = -3 is the same as TIFF_VARIABLE except that the count argument must have type uint32_t.

       • TIFF_SPP = -2 indicates that the number of arguments is equal to the image’s number of samples per pixel.

       fip is a field information pointer previously returned by TIFFFindField(), TIFFFieldWithTag(), or TIFFFieldWithName().

RETURN VALUES
       TIFFFieldReadCount() returns an integer.
