NAME
       gnutls_transport_set_errno - API function

SYNOPSIS
       #include <gnutls/gnutls.h>

       void gnutls_transport_set_errno(gnutls_session_t session, int err);

ARGUMENTS
       gnutls_session_t session
                   is a gnutls_session_t type.

       int err     error value to store in session-specific errno variable.

DESCRIPTION
       Store  err in the session-specific errno variable.  Useful values for  err are EINTR, EAGAIN and EMSGSIZE, other values are treated will be treated as real errors in the push/pull function.

       This  function  is useful in replacement push and pull functions set by gnutls_transport_set_push_function() and gnutls_transport_set_pull_function() under Windows, where the replacements may not
       have access to the same  errno variable that is used by GnuTLS (e.g., the application is linked to msvcr71.dll and gnutls is linked to msvcrt.dll).

       This function is unreliable if you are using the same
        session in different threads for sending and receiving.
