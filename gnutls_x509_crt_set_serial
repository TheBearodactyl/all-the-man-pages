NAME
       gnutls_x509_crt_set_serial - API function

SYNOPSIS
       #include <gnutls/x509.h>

       int gnutls_x509_crt_set_serial(gnutls_x509_crt_t cert, const void * serial, size_t serial_size);

ARGUMENTS
       gnutls_x509_crt_t cert
                   a certificate of type gnutls_x509_crt_t

       const void * serial
                   The serial number

       size_t serial_size
                   Holds the size of the serial field.

DESCRIPTION
       This  function will set the X.509 certificate's serial number.  While the serial number is an integer, it is often handled as an opaque field by several CAs. For this reason this function accepts
       any kind of data as a serial number. To be consistent with the X.509/PKIX specifications the provided  serial should be a big-endian positive number (i.e. its leftmost bit should be zero).

       The size of the serial is restricted to 20 bytes maximum by RFC5280.  This function allows writing more than 20 bytes but the generated certificates in that case may be rejected by  other  imple‐
       mentations.

RETURNS
       On success, GNUTLS_E_SUCCESS (0) is returned, otherwise a negative error value.
