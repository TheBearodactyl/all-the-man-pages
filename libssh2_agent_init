NAME
       libssh2_agent_init - init an ssh-agent handle

SYNOPSIS
       #include <libssh2.h>

       LIBSSH2_AGENT *libssh2_agent_init(LIBSSH2_SESSION *session);

DESCRIPTION
       Init  an  ssh-agent  handle. Returns the handle to an internal representation of an ssh-agent connection.  After the successful initialization, an application can call libssh2_agent_connect(3) to
       connect to a running ssh-agent.

       Call libssh2_agent_free(3) to free the handle again after you're doing using it.

RETURN VALUE
       Returns a handle pointer or NULL if something went wrong. The returned handle is used as input to all other ssh-agent related functions libssh2 provides.

AVAILABILITY
       Added in libssh2 1.2
