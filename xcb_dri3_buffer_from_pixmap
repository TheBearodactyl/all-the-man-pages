REPLY FIELDS
       response_type
                 The type of this reply, in this case XCB_DRI3_BUFFER_FROM_PIXMAP. This field is also present in the xcb_generic_reply_t and can be used to tell replies apart from each other.

       length    The length of the reply, in words (a word is 4 bytes).

DESCRIPTION
RETURN VALUE
       Returns an xcb_dri3_buffer_from_pixmap_cookie_t. Errors have to be handled when calling the reply function xcb_dri3_buffer_from_pixmap_reply.

       If you want to handle errors in the event loop instead, use xcb_dri3_buffer_from_pixmap_unchecked. See xcb-requests(3) for details.

ERRORS
       This request does never generate any errors.
