DESCRIPTION
       The functions described here set and manage the list of CA names that
       are sent between two communicating peers.

       For TLS versions 1.2 and earlier the list of CA names is only sent from
       the server to the client when requesting a client certificate. So any
       list of CA names set is never sent from client to server and the list
       of CA names retrieved by SSL_get0_peer_CA_list() is always NULL.

       For TLS 1.3 the list of CA names is sent using the
       certificate_authorities extension and may be sent by a client (in the
       ClientHello message) or by a server (when requesting a certificate).

       In most cases it is not necessary to set CA names on the client side.
       The list of CA names that are acceptable to the client will be sent in
       plaintext to the server. This has privacy implications and may also
       have performance implications if the list is large. This optional
       capability was introduced as part of TLSv1.3 and therefore setting CA
       names on the client side will have no impact if that protocol version
       has been disabled. Most servers do not need this and so this should be
       avoided unless required.

       The "client CA list" functions below only have an effect when called on
       the server side.

       SSL_CTX_set_client_CA_list() sets the list of CAs sent to the client
       when requesting a client certificate for ctx. Ownership of list is
       transferred to ctx and it should not be freed by the caller.

       SSL_set_client_CA_list() sets the list of CAs sent to the client when
       requesting a client certificate for the chosen ssl, overriding the
       setting valid for ssl's SSL_CTX object. Ownership of list is
       transferred to s and it should not be freed by the caller.

       SSL_CTX_get_client_CA_list() returns the list of client CAs explicitly
       set for ctx using SSL_CTX_set_client_CA_list(). The returned list
       should not be freed by the caller.

       SSL_get_client_CA_list() returns the list of client CAs explicitly set
       for ssl using SSL_set_client_CA_list() or ssl's SSL_CTX object with
       SSL_CTX_set_client_CA_list(), when in server mode. In client mode,
       SSL_get_client_CA_list returns the list of client CAs sent from the
       server, if any. The returned list should not be freed by the caller.

       SSL_CTX_add_client_CA() adds the CA name extracted from cacert to the
       list of CAs sent to the client when requesting a client certificate for
       ctx.

       SSL_add_client_CA() adds the CA name extracted from cacert to the list
       of CAs sent to the client when requesting a client certificate for the
       chosen ssl, overriding the setting valid for ssl's SSL_CTX object.

       SSL_get0_peer_CA_list() retrieves the list of CA names (if any) the
       peer has sent. This can be called on either the server or the client
       side. The returned list should not be freed by the caller.

       The "generic CA list" functions below are very similar to the "client
       CA list" functions except that they have an effect on both the server
       and client sides. The lists of CA names managed are separate - so you
       cannot (for example) set CA names using the "client CA list" functions
       and then get them using the "generic CA list" functions. Where a mix of
       the two types of functions has been used on the server side then the
       "client CA list" functions take precedence.  Typically, on the server
       side, the "client CA list " functions should be used in preference. As
       noted above in most cases it is not necessary to set CA names on the
       client side.

       SSL_CTX_set0_CA_list() sets the list of CAs to be sent to the peer to
       name_list. Ownership of name_list is transferred to ctx and it should
       not be freed by the caller.

       SSL_set0_CA_list() sets the list of CAs to be sent to the peer to
       name_list overriding any list set in the parent SSL_CTX of s. Ownership
       of name_list is transferred to s and it should not be freed by the
       caller.

       SSL_CTX_get0_CA_list() retrieves any previously set list of CAs set for
       ctx. The returned list should not be freed by the caller.

       SSL_get0_CA_list() retrieves any previously set list of CAs set for s
       or if none are set the list from the parent SSL_CTX is retrieved. The
       returned list should not be freed by the caller.

       SSL_CTX_add1_to_CA_list() appends the CA subject name extracted from x
       to the list of CAs sent to peer for ctx.

       SSL_add1_to_CA_list() appends the CA subject name extracted from x to
       the list of CAs sent to the peer for s, overriding the setting in the
       parent SSL_CTX.

NOTES
       When a TLS/SSL server requests a client certificate (see
       SSL_CTX_set_verify(3)), it sends a list of CAs, for which it will
       accept certificates, to the client.

       This list must explicitly be set using SSL_CTX_set_client_CA_list() or
       SSL_CTX_set0_CA_list() for ctx and SSL_set_client_CA_list() or
       SSL_set0_CA_list() for the specific ssl. The list specified overrides
       the previous setting. The CAs listed do not become trusted (list only
       contains the names, not the complete certificates); use
       SSL_CTX_load_verify_locations(3) to additionally load them for
       verification.

       If the list of acceptable CAs is compiled in a file, the
       SSL_load_client_CA_file(3) function can be used to help to import the
       necessary data.

       SSL_CTX_add_client_CA(), SSL_CTX_add1_to_CA_list(), SSL_add_client_CA()
       and SSL_add1_to_CA_list() can be used to add additional items the list
       of CAs. If no list was specified before using
       SSL_CTX_set_client_CA_list(), SSL_CTX_set0_CA_list(),
       SSL_set_client_CA_list() or SSL_set0_CA_list(), a new CA list for ctx
       or ssl (as appropriate) is opened.

RETURN VALUES
       SSL_CTX_set_client_CA_list(), SSL_set_client_CA_list(),
       SSL_CTX_set_client_CA_list(), SSL_set_client_CA_list(),
       SSL_CTX_set0_CA_list() and SSL_set0_CA_list() do not return a value.

       SSL_CTX_get_client_CA_list(), SSL_get_client_CA_list(),
       SSL_CTX_get0_CA_list() and SSL_get0_CA_list() return a stack of CA
       names or NULL is no CA names are set.

       SSL_CTX_add_client_CA(),SSL_add_client_CA(), SSL_CTX_add1_to_CA_list()
       and SSL_add1_to_CA_list() return 1 for success and 0 for failure.

       SSL_get0_peer_CA_list() returns a stack of CA names sent by the peer or
       NULL or an empty stack if no list was sent.

EXAMPLES
       Scan all certificates in CAfile and list them as acceptable CAs:

        SSL_CTX_set_client_CA_list(ctx, SSL_load_client_CA_file(CAfile));
