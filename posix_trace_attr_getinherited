SYNOPSIS
       #include <trace.h>

       int posix_trace_attr_getinherited(const trace_attr_t *restrict attr,
           int *restrict inheritancepolicy);
       int posix_trace_attr_getlogfullpolicy(const trace_attr_t *restrict attr,
           int *restrict logpolicy);
       int posix_trace_attr_getstreamfullpolicy(const trace_attr_t *restrict
           attr, int *restrict streampolicy);
       int posix_trace_attr_setinherited(trace_attr_t *attr,
           int inheritancepolicy);
       int posix_trace_attr_setlogfullpolicy(trace_attr_t *attr,
           int logpolicy);
       int posix_trace_attr_setstreamfullpolicy(trace_attr_t *attr,
           int streampolicy);

DESCRIPTION
       The posix_trace_attr_getinherited() and posix_trace_attr_setinherited()
       functions, respectively, shall  get  and  set  the  inheritance  policy
       stored  in  the  inheritance  attribute for traced processes across the
       fork() and spawn() operations. The inheritance  attribute  of  the  at‐
       tributes  object pointed to by the attr argument shall be set to one of
       the following values defined by manifest  constants  in  the  <trace.h>
       header:

       POSIX_TRACE_CLOSE_FOR_CHILD
             After  a  fork()  or  spawn()  operation,  the child shall not be
             traced, and tracing of the parent shall continue.

       POSIX_TRACE_INHERITED
             After a fork() or spawn()  operation,  if  the  parent  is  being
             traced,  its  child  shall  be concurrently traced using the same
             trace stream.

       The    default    value    for    the    inheritance    attribute    is
       POSIX_TRACE_CLOSE_FOR_CHILD.

       The  posix_trace_attr_getlogfullpolicy()  and  posix_trace_attr_setlog‐
       fullpolicy() functions, respectively, shall get and set the  trace  log
       full  policy  stored in the log-full-policy attribute of the attributes
       object pointed to by the attr argument.

       The log-full-policy attribute shall be set to one of the following val‐
       ues defined by manifest constants in the <trace.h> header:

       POSIX_TRACE_LOOP
             The  trace  log  shall  loop until the associated trace stream is
             stopped.  This policy means that when the trace  log  gets  full,
             the file system shall reuse the resources allocated to the oldest
             trace events that were recorded. In this way, the trace log  will
             always contain the most recent trace events flushed.

       POSIX_TRACE_UNTIL_FULL
             The  trace  stream  shall  be  flushed to the trace log until the
             trace log is  full.  This  condition  can  be  deduced  from  the
             posix_log_full_status  member  status  (see  the posix_trace_sta‐
             tus_info structure defined  in  <trace.h>).   The  last  recorded
             trace event shall be the POSIX_TRACE_STOP trace event.

       POSIX_TRACE_APPEND
             The  associated  trace  stream  shall be flushed to the trace log
             without  log  size  limitation.  If  the  application   specifies
             POSIX_TRACE_APPEND,  the implementation shall ignore the log-max-
             size attribute.

       The   default   value   for   the    log-full-policy    attribute    is
       POSIX_TRACE_LOOP.

       The  posix_trace_attr_getstreamfullpolicy()  and  posix_trace_attr_set‐
       streamfullpolicy() functions, respectively, shall get and set the trace
       stream  full  policy  stored in the stream-full-policy attribute of the
       attributes object pointed to by the attr argument.

       The stream-full-policy attribute shall be set to one of  the  following
       values defined by manifest constants in the <trace.h> header:

       POSIX_TRACE_LOOP
             The  trace  stream  shall  loop  until  explicitly stopped by the
             posix_trace_stop() function. This  policy  means  that  when  the
             trace  stream is full, the trace system shall reuse the resources
             allocated to the oldest trace events recorded. In this  way,  the
             trace  stream  will  always  contain the most recent trace events
             recorded.

       POSIX_TRACE_UNTIL_FULL
             The trace stream will run until the trace  stream  resources  are
             exhausted. Then the trace stream will stop. This condition can be
             deduced  from  posix_stream_status  and  posix_stream_full_status
             (see the posix_trace_status_info structure defined in <trace.h>).
             When this trace stream is read, a  POSIX_TRACE_STOP  trace  event
             shall  be reported after reporting the last recorded trace event.
             The trace system shall reuse the resources allocated to any trace
             events   already  reported—see  the  posix_trace_getnext_event(),
             posix_trace_trygetnext_event(),     and     posix_trace_timedget‐
             next_event()  functions—or  already  flushed  for an active trace
             stream with log if the Trace Log option  is  supported;  see  the
             posix_trace_flush()  function. The trace system shall restart the
             trace stream when it is  empty  and  may  restart  it  sooner.  A
             POSIX_TRACE_START  trace event shall be reported before reporting
             the next recorded trace event.

       POSIX_TRACE_FLUSH
             If the Trace Log option is supported, this policy is identical to
             the  POSIX_TRACE_UNTIL_FULL  trace stream full policy except that
             the   trace   stream   shall   be   flushed   regularly   as   if
             posix_trace_flush()  had  been  explicitly  called. Defining this
             policy for an active trace stream without log shall be invalid.

       The  default  value  for  the  stream-full-policy  attribute  shall  be
       POSIX_TRACE_LOOP for an active trace stream without log.

       If the Trace Log option is supported, the default value for the stream-
       full-policy attribute shall be POSIX_TRACE_FLUSH for  an  active  trace
       stream with log.

RETURN VALUE
       Upon  successful  completion,  these  functions shall return a value of
       zero. Otherwise, they shall return the corresponding error number.

       If successful, the posix_trace_attr_getinherited() function shall store
       the  inheritance attribute value in the object pointed to by inheritan‐
       cepolicy.  Otherwise, the content of this object is undefined.

       If successful, the posix_trace_attr_getlogfullpolicy()  function  shall
       store  the  log-full-policy attribute value in the object pointed to by
       logpolicy.  Otherwise, the content of this object is undefined.

       If  successful,  the  posix_trace_attr_getstreamfullpolicy()   function
       shall  store  the  stream-full-policy  attribute  value  in  the object
       pointed to by streampolicy.  Otherwise, the content of this  object  is
       undefined.

ERRORS
       These functions may fail if:

       EINVAL The value specified by at least one of the arguments is invalid.

              posix_trace_attr_setstreamfullpolicy()

       may be removed in a future version.
