RSA_BLINDING_ON(3ssl)               OpenSSL              RSA_BLINDING_ON(3ssl)

NAME
       RSA_blinding_on, RSA_blinding_off - protect the RSA operation from
       timing attacks

SYNOPSIS
        #include <openssl/rsa.h>

       The following functions have been deprecated since OpenSSL 3.0, and can
       be hidden entirely by defining OPENSSL_API_COMPAT with a suitable
       version value, see openssl_user_macros(7):

        int RSA_blinding_on(RSA *rsa, BN_CTX *ctx);

        void RSA_blinding_off(RSA *rsa);

DESCRIPTION
       All of the functions described on this page are deprecated.

       RSA is vulnerable to timing attacks. In a setup where attackers can
       measure the time of RSA decryption or signature operations, blinding
       must be used to protect the RSA operation from that attack.

       RSA_blinding_on() turns blinding on for key rsa and generates a random
       blinding factor. ctx is NULL or a preallocated and initialized BN_CTX.

       RSA_blinding_off() turns blinding off and frees the memory used for the
       blinding factor.

RETURN VALUES
       RSA_blinding_on() returns 1 on success, and 0 if an error occurred.

       RSA_blinding_off() returns no value.

HISTORY
       All of these functions were deprecated in OpenSSL 3.0.
