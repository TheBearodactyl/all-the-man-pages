NAME
       libssh2_version - return the libssh2 version number

SYNOPSIS
       #include <libssh2.h>

       const char * libssh2_version(int required_version);

DESCRIPTION
       If required_version is lower than or equal to the version number of the libssh2 in use, the version number of libssh2 is returned as a pointer to a zero terminated string.

       The required_version should be the version number as constructed by the LIBSSH2_VERSION_NUM define in the libssh2.h public header file, which is a 24 bit number in the 0xMMmmpp format. MM for ma‚Äê
       jor, mm for minor and pp for patch number.

RETURN VALUE
       The version number of libssh2 is returned as a pointer to a zero terminated string or NULL if the required_version isn't fulfilled.

EXAMPLE
       To make sure you run with the correct libssh2 version:

       if (!libssh2_version(LIBSSH2_VERSION_NUM)) {
         fprintf (stderr, "Runtime libssh2 version too old!");
         exit(1);
       }

       Unconditionally get the version number:

       printf("libssh2 version: %s", libssh2_version(0) );

AVAILABILITY
       This function was added in libssh2 1.1, in previous versions there way no way to extract this info in run-time.
