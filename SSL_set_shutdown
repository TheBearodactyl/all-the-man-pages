SSL_SET_SHUTDOWN(3ssl)              OpenSSL             SSL_SET_SHUTDOWN(3ssl)

NAME
       SSL_set_shutdown, SSL_get_shutdown - manipulate shutdown state of an
       SSL connection

SYNOPSIS
        #include <openssl/ssl.h>

        void SSL_set_shutdown(SSL *ssl, int mode);

        int SSL_get_shutdown(const SSL *ssl);

DESCRIPTION
       SSL_set_shutdown() sets the shutdown state of ssl to mode.

       SSL_get_shutdown() returns the shutdown mode of ssl.

NOTES
       The shutdown state of an ssl connection is a bit-mask of:

       0   No shutdown setting, yet.

       SSL_SENT_SHUTDOWN
           A close_notify shutdown alert was sent to the peer, the connection
           is being considered closed and the session is closed and correct.

       SSL_RECEIVED_SHUTDOWN
           A shutdown alert was received form the peer, either a normal
           close_notify or a fatal error.

       SSL_SENT_SHUTDOWN and SSL_RECEIVED_SHUTDOWN can be set at the same
       time.

       The shutdown state of the connection is used to determine the state of
       the ssl session. If the session is still open, when SSL_clear(3) or
       SSL_free(3) is called, it is considered bad and removed according to
       RFC2246.  The actual condition for a correctly closed session is
       SSL_SENT_SHUTDOWN (according to the TLS RFC, it is acceptable to only
       send the close_notify alert but to not wait for the peer's answer, when
       the underlying connection is closed).  SSL_set_shutdown() can be used
       to set this state without sending a close alert to the peer (see
       SSL_shutdown(3)).

       If a close_notify was received, SSL_RECEIVED_SHUTDOWN will be set, for
       setting SSL_SENT_SHUTDOWN the application must however still call
       SSL_shutdown(3) or SSL_set_shutdown() itself.

RETURN VALUES
       SSL_set_shutdown() does not return diagnostic information.

       SSL_get_shutdown() returns the current setting.
