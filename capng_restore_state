NAME
       capng_restore_state - set the internal library state

SYNOPSIS
       #include <cap-ng.h>

       void capng_restore_state(void **state);

DESCRIPTION
       capng_restore_state  is  a  function  that takes the state information previously saved by capng_save_state and restores the libraries internal state. This function is not available in the python
       bindings.

RETURN VALUE
       None.

NOTES
       capng_restore_state free's the previously malloc'd state, thus the state can't be restored multiple times.

       The working pid is part of the restored state, if restoring the state to a different thread, capng_setpid can be used to update it.
