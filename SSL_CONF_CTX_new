SSL_CONF_CTX_NEW(3ssl)              OpenSSL             SSL_CONF_CTX_NEW(3ssl)

NAME
       SSL_CONF_CTX_new, SSL_CONF_CTX_free - SSL configuration allocation
       functions

SYNOPSIS
        #include <openssl/ssl.h>

        SSL_CONF_CTX *SSL_CONF_CTX_new(void);
        void SSL_CONF_CTX_free(SSL_CONF_CTX *cctx);

DESCRIPTION
       The function SSL_CONF_CTX_new() allocates and initialises an
       SSL_CONF_CTX structure for use with the SSL_CONF functions.

       The function SSL_CONF_CTX_free() frees up the context cctx.  If cctx is
       NULL nothing is done.

RETURN VALUES
       SSL_CONF_CTX_new() returns either the newly allocated SSL_CONF_CTX
       structure or NULL if an error occurs.

       SSL_CONF_CTX_free() does not return a value.
