NAME
       gnutls_x509_crq_get_dn_oid - API function

SYNOPSIS
       #include <gnutls/x509.h>

       int gnutls_x509_crq_get_dn_oid(gnutls_x509_crq_t crq, unsigned indx, void * oid, size_t * sizeof_oid);

ARGUMENTS
       gnutls_x509_crq_t crq
                   should contain a gnutls_x509_crq_t type

       unsigned indx
                   Specifies which DN OID to get. Use (0) to get the first one.

       void * oid  a pointer to a structure to hold the name (may be NULL)

       size_t * sizeof_oid
                   initially holds the size of  oid

DESCRIPTION
       This function will extract the requested OID of the name of the certificate request subject, specified by the given index.

RETURNS
       GNUTLS_E_SHORT_MEMORY_BUFFER if the provided buffer is not long enough, and in that case the * sizeof_oid will be updated with the required size.  On success 0 is returned.
