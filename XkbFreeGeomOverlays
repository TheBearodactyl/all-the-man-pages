NAME
       XkbFreeGeomOverlays - Free rows in a section

SYNOPSIS
       void XkbFreeGeomOverlays (XkbSectionPtr section, int first, int count, Bool free_all);

ARGUMENTS
       section
              section in which overlays should be freed

       first  first overlay to be freed

       count  number of overlays to be freed

       free_all
              True => all overlays are freed

DESCRIPTION
       Xkb  provides a number of functions to allocate and free subcomponents of a keyboard geometry. Use these functions to create or modify keyboard geometries.  Note that these functions merely allo‚Äê
       cate space for the new element(s), and it is up to you to fill in the values explicitly in your code. These allocation functions increase sz_* but never touch num_* (unless there is an allocation
       failure,  in which case they reset both sz_* and num_* to zero). These functions return Success if they succeed, BadAlloc if they are not able to allocate space, or BadValue if a parameter is not
       as expected.

       If free_all is True, all overlays are freed regardless of the value of first and count.  Otherwise, the number of overlays specified by count are freed, beginning with the  overlay  specified  by
       first in the specified section.

RETURN VALUES
       Success        The XkbFreeGeomOverlays functions returns Success if there are no allocation or argument errors.

DIAGNOSTICS
       BadAlloc       Unable to allocate storage

       BadValue       An argument is out of range
