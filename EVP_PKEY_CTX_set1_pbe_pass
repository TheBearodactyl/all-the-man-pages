NAME
       EVP_PKEY_CTX_set1_pbe_pass - generic KDF support functions

SYNOPSIS
        #include <openssl/kdf.h>

        int EVP_PKEY_CTX_set1_pbe_pass(EVP_PKEY_CTX *pctx, unsigned char *pass,
                                       int passlen);

DESCRIPTION
       These functions are generic support functions for all KDF algorithms.

       EVP_PKEY_CTX_set1_pbe_pass() sets the password to the passlen first bytes from pass.

STRING CTRLS
       There is also support for string based control operations via EVP_PKEY_CTX_ctrl_str(3).  The password can be directly specified using the type parameter "pass" or given in hex encoding using the
       "hexpass" parameter.

RETURN VALUES
       All these functions return 1 for success and 0 or a negative value for failure.  In particular a return value of -2 indicates the operation is not supported by the public key algorithm.

SEE ALSO
       EVP_PKEY_CTX_new(3), EVP_PKEY_CTX_ctrl_str(3), EVP_PKEY_derive(3)

HISTORY
       EVP_PKEY_CTX_set1_pbe_pass() was converted from a macro to a function in OpenSSL 3.0.
