PAM_SYSTEMD_HOME(8)            pam_systemd_home            PAM_SYSTEMD_HOME(8)

NAME
       pam_systemd_home - Authenticate users and mount home directories via
       systemd-homed.service

SYNOPSIS
       pam_systemd_home.so

DESCRIPTION
       pam_systemd_home ensures that home directories managed by systemd-
       homed.service(8) are automatically activated (mounted) on user login,
       and are deactivated (unmounted) when the last session of the user ends.
       For such users, it also provides authentication (when per-user disk
       encryption is used, the disk encryption key is derived from the
       authentication credential supplied at login time), account management
       (the JSON user record[1] embedded in the home store contains account
       details), and implements the updating of the encryption password (which
       is also used for user authentication).

OPTIONS
       The following options are understood:

       suspend=
           Takes a boolean argument. If true, the home directory of the user
           will be suspended automatically during system suspend; if false it
           will remain active. Automatic suspending of the home directory
           improves security substantially as secret key material is
           automatically removed from memory before the system is put to sleep
           and must be re-acquired (through user re-authentication) when
           coming back from suspend. It is recommended to set this parameter
           for all PAM applications that have support for automatically
           re-authenticating via PAM on system resume. If multiple sessions of
           the same user are open in parallel the user's home directory will
           be left unsuspended on system suspend as long as at least one of
           the sessions does not set this parameter to on. Defaults to off.

           Note that TTY logins generally do not support re-authentication on
           system resume. Re-authentication on system resume is primarily a
           concept implementable in graphical environments, in the form of
           lock screens brought up automatically when the system goes to
           sleep. This means that if a user concurrently uses graphical login
           sessions that implement the required re-authentication mechanism
           and console logins that do not, the home directory is not locked
           during suspend, due to the logic explained above. That said, it is
           possible to set this field for TTY logins too, ignoring the fact
           that TTY logins actually don't support the re-authentication
           mechanism. In that case the TTY sessions will appear hung until the
           user logs in on another virtual terminal (regardless if via another
           TTY session or graphically) which will resume the home directory
           and unblock the original TTY session. (Do note that lack of screen
           locking on TTY sessions means even though the TTY session appears
           hung, keypresses can still be queued into it, and the existing
           screen contents be read without re-authentication; this limitation
           is unrelated to the home directory management pam_systemd_home and
           systemd-homed.service implement.)

           Turning this option on by default is highly recommended for all
           sessions, but only if the service managing these sessions correctly
           implements the aforementioned re-authentication. Note that the
           re-authentication must take place from a component running outside
           of the user's context, so that it does not require access to the
           user's home directory for operation. Traditionally, most desktop
           environments do not implement screen locking this way, and need to
           be updated accordingly.

           This setting may also be controlled via the $SYSTEMD_HOME_SUSPEND
           environment variable (see below), which pam_systemd_home reads
           during initialization and sets for sessions. If both the
           environment variable is set and the module parameter specified the
           latter takes precedence.

       debug[=]
           Takes an optional boolean argument. If yes or without the argument,
           the module will log debugging information as it operates.

MODULE TYPES PROVIDED
       The module implements all four PAM operations: auth (to allow
       authentication using the encrypted data), account (because users with
       systemd-homed.service user accounts are described in a JSON user
       record[1] and may be configured in more detail than in the traditional
       Linux user database), session (because user sessions must be tracked in
       order to implement automatic release when the last session of the user
       is gone), password (to change the encryption password — also used for
       user authentication — through PAM).

ENVIRONMENT
       The following environment variables are initialized by the module and
       available to the processes of the user's session:

       $SYSTEMD_HOME=1
           Indicates that the user's home directory is managed by
           systemd-homed.service.

       $SYSTEMD_HOME_SUSPEND=
           Indicates whether the session has been registered with the suspend
           mechanism enabled or disabled (see above). The variable's value is
           either "0" or "1". Note that the module both reads the variable
           when initializing, and sets it for sessions.

EXAMPLE
       Here's an example PAM configuration fragment that permits users managed
       by systemd-homed.service to log in:

           #%PAM-1.0
           auth      sufficient pam_unix.so
           -auth     sufficient pam_systemd_home.so
           auth      required   pam_deny.so

           account   required   pam_nologin.so
           -account  sufficient pam_systemd_home.so
           account   sufficient pam_unix.so
           account   required   pam_permit.so

           -password sufficient pam_systemd_home.so
           password  sufficient pam_unix.so sha512 shadow try_first_pass use_authtok
           password  required   pam_deny.so

           -session  optional   pam_keyinit.so revoke
           -session  optional   pam_loginuid.so
           -session  optional   pam_systemd_home.so
           -session  optional   pam_systemd.so
           session   required   pam_unix.so
