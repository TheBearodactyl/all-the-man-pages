NAME
       gnutls_heartbeat_ping - API function

SYNOPSIS
       #include <gnutls/gnutls.h>

       int gnutls_heartbeat_ping(gnutls_session_t session, size_t data_size, unsigned int max_tries, unsigned int flags);

ARGUMENTS
       gnutls_session_t session
                   is a gnutls_session_t type.

       size_t data_size
                   is the length of the ping payload.

       unsigned int max_tries
                   if flags is GNUTLS_HEARTBEAT_WAIT then this sets the number of retransmissions. Use zero for indefinite (until timeout).

       unsigned int flags
                   if GNUTLS_HEARTBEAT_WAIT then wait for pong or timeout instead of returning immediately.

DESCRIPTION
       This function sends a ping to the peer. If the  flags is set to GNUTLS_HEARTBEAT_WAIT then it waits for a reply from the peer.

       Note that it is highly recommended to use this function with the flag GNUTLS_HEARTBEAT_WAIT, or you need to handle retransmissions and timeouts manually.

       The total TLS data transmitted as part of the ping message are given by the following formula: MAX(16,  data_size )+gnutls_record_overhead_size()+3.

RETURNS
       GNUTLS_E_SUCCESS on success, otherwise a negative error code.

SINCE
       3.1.2
