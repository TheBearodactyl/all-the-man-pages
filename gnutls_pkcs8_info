NAME
       gnutls_pkcs8_info - API function

SYNOPSIS
       #include <gnutls/x509.h>

       int  gnutls_pkcs8_info(const  gnutls_datum_t  * data, gnutls_x509_crt_fmt_t format, unsigned int * schema, unsigned int * cipher, void * salt, unsigned int * salt_size, unsigned int * iter_count,
       char ** oid);

ARGUMENTS
       const gnutls_datum_t * data
                   Holds the PKCS 8 data

       gnutls_x509_crt_fmt_t format
                   the format of the PKCS 8 data

       unsigned int * schema
                   indicate the schema as one of gnutls_pkcs_encrypt_flags_t

       unsigned int * cipher
                   the cipher used as gnutls_cipher_algorithm_t

       void * salt PBKDF2 salt (if non-NULL then  salt_size initially holds its size)

       unsigned int * salt_size
                   PBKDF2 salt size

       unsigned int * iter_count
                   PBKDF2 iteration count

       char ** oid if non-NULL it will contain an allocated null-terminated variable with the OID

DESCRIPTION
       This function will provide information on the algorithms used in a particular PKCS 8 structure. If the structure algorithms are unknown the code GNUTLS_E_UNKNOWN_CIPHER_TYPE will be returned, and
       only  oid , will be set. That is,  oid will be set on encrypted PKCS 8 structures whether supported or not. It must be deinitialized using gnutls_free().  The other variables are only set on sup‐
       ported structures.

RETURNS
       GNUTLS_E_INVALID_REQUEST if the provided structure isn't an encrypted key, GNUTLS_E_UNKNOWN_CIPHER_TYPE if the structure's encryption isn't supported, or another negative error code in case of  a
       failure. Zero on success.

SINCE
       3.4.0
