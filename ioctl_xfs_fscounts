IOCTL-XFS-FSCOUNTS(2)                                                                       System Calls Manual                                                                      IOCTL-XFS-FSCOUNTS(2)

NAME
       ioctl_xfs_fscounts - query XFS summary counter information

SYNOPSIS
       #include <xfs/xfs_fs.h>

       int ioctl(int fd, XFS_IOC_FSCOUNTS, struct xfs_fsop_counts *arg);

DESCRIPTION
       Query  the raw filesystem summary counters.  Unlike statvfs(3), the values returned here are the raw values, which do not reflect any alterations or limits set by project quotas.  The counter in‚Äê
       formation is conveyed in a structure of the following form:

           struct xfs_fsop_counts {
                __u64   freedata;
                __u64   freertx;
                __u64   freeino;
                __u64   allocino;
           };

       The fields of this structure are as follows:

       freedata is the number of free filesystem blocks on the data device.

       freertx is the number of free extents on the realtime device.

       freeino is the number of inode records that are not in use within the space that has been allocated for them.

       allocino is the number of inode records for which space has been allocated.

RETURN VALUE
       On error, -1 is returned, and errno is set to indicate the error.

ERRORS
       Error codes can be one of, but are not limited to, the following:

       EFSBADCRC
              Metadata checksum validation failed while performing the query.

       EFSCORRUPTED
              Metadata corruption was encountered while performing the query.

       EINVAL The specified allocation group number is not valid for this filesystem.

       EIO    An I/O error was encountered while performing the query.

CONFORMING TO
       This API is specific to XFS filesystem on the Linux kernel.
