NAME
       File::Spec::Epoc - methods for Epoc file specs

SYNOPSIS
        require File::Spec::Epoc; # Done internally by File::Spec if needed

DESCRIPTION
       See File::Spec::Unix for a documentation of the methods provided there.  This package overrides the implementation of these methods, not the semantics.

       This package is still a work in progress. ;-)

       canonpath()
           No physical check on the filesystem, but a logical cleanup of a path.  On UNIX eliminated successive slashes and successive "/.".
