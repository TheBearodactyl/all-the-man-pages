SYNOPSIS

        unsigned char *MD5(const unsigned char *d, unsigned long n, unsigned char *md);

        int MD5_Update(MD5_CTX *c, const void *data, unsigned long len);
        int MD5_Final(unsigned char *md, MD5_CTX *c);

DESCRIPTION
       All of the functions described on this page are deprecated.  Applications should instead use EVP_DigestInit_ex(3), EVP_DigestUpdate(3) and EVP_DigestFinal_ex(3).

       MD2, MD4, and MD5 are cryptographic hash functions with a 128 bit output.

       MD2(), MD4(), and MD5() compute the MD2, MD4, and MD5 message digest of the n bytes at d and place it in md (which must have space for MD2_DIGEST_LENGTH == MD4_DIGEST_LENGTH == MD5_DIGEST_LENGTH
       == 16 bytes of output). If md is NULL, the digest is placed in a static array.

       The following functions may be used if the message is not completely stored in memory:

       MD2_Init() initializes a MD2_CTX structure.

       MD2_Update() can be called repeatedly with chunks of the message to be hashed (len bytes at data).

       MD2_Final() places the message digest in md, which must have space for MD2_DIGEST_LENGTH == 16 bytes of output, and erases the MD2_CTX.

       MD4_Init(), MD4_Update(), MD4_Final(), MD5_Init(), MD5_Update(), and MD5_Final() are analogous using an MD4_CTX and MD5_CTX structure.

       Applications should use the higher level functions EVP_DigestInit(3) etc. instead of calling the hash functions directly.

NOTE
       MD2, MD4, and MD5 are recommended only for compatibility with existing applications. In new applications, hashes from the SHA-2 or SHA-3 family should be preferred.

RETURN VALUES
       MD2(), MD4(), and MD5() return pointers to the hash value.

       MD2_Init(), MD2_Update(), MD2_Final(), MD4_Init(), MD4_Update(), MD4_Final(), MD5_Init(), MD5_Update(), and MD5_Final() return 1 for success, 0 otherwise.

DESCRIPTION
     The MD5 functions calculate a 128-bit cryptographic checksum (digest) for any number of input bytes.  A cryptographic checksum is a one-way hash-function, that is, you cannot find (except by ex‐
     haustive search) the input corresponding to a particular output.  This net result is a “fingerprint” of the input-data, which doesn't disclose the actual input.

     MD2 is the slowest, MD4 is the fastest and MD5 is somewhere in the middle.  MD2 can only be used for Privacy-Enhanced Mail.  MD4 has been criticized for being too weak, so MD5 was developed in re‐
     sponse as ``MD4 with safety-belts''.  MD4 and MD5 have been broken; they should only be used where necessary for backward compatibility.  The attacks on both MD4 and MD5 are both in the nature of
     finding “collisions” - that is, multiple inputs which hash to the same value; it is still unlikely for an attacker to be able to determine the exact original input given a hash value.

     The MD5Init(), MD5Update(), and MD5Final() functions are the core functions.  Allocate an MD5_CTX, initialize it with MD5Init(), run over the data with MD5Update(), and finally extract the result
     using MD5Final().

     The MD5Pad() function can be used to apply padding to the message digest as in MD5Final(), but the current context can still be used with MD5Update().

     The MD5Transform() function is used by MD5Update() to hash 512-bit blocks and forms the core of the algorithm.  Most programs should use the interface provided by MD5Init(), MD5Update() and
     MD5Final() instead of calling MD5Transform() directly.

     MD5End() is a wrapper for MD5Final() which converts the return value to an MD5_DIGEST_STRING_LENGTH-character (including the terminating '\0') ASCII string which represents the 128 bits in hexadec‐
     imal.

     MD5File() calculates the digest of a file, and uses MD5End() to return the result.  If the file cannot be opened, a null pointer is returned.

     MD5FileChunk() behaves like MD5File() but calculates the digest only for that portion of the file starting at offset and continuing for length bytes or until end of file is reached, whichever comes
     first.  A zero length can be specified to read until end of file.  A negative length or offset will be ignored.  MD5Data() calculates the digest of a chunk of data in memory, and uses MD5End() to
     return the result.

     When using MD5End(), MD5File(), MD5FileChunk(), or MD5Data(), the buf argument can be a null pointer, in which case the returned string is allocated with malloc(3) and subsequently must be explic‐
     itly deallocated using free(3) after use.  If the buf argument is non-null it must point to at least MD5_DIGEST_STRING_LENGTH characters of buffer space.

     MD4 has been broken; it should only be used where necessary for backward compatibility.  MD5 has not yet (1999-02-11) been broken, but recent attacks have cast some doubt on its security proper‐
