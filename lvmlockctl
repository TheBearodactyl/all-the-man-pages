       -q|--quit
              Tell lvmlockd to quit.

       -D|--gl-disable vgname
              Tell lvmlockd to disable the global lock in a sanlock VG.

       -S|--stop-lockspaces
              Stop all lockspaces.

USAGE
       --info This  collects  and displays lock state from lvmlockd.  The display is primitive, incomplete and will change in future version.  To print the raw lock state from lvmlockd, combine this op‐
              tion with --dump|-d.

       --dump This collects the circular log buffer of debug statements from lvmlockd and prints it.

       --kill This is run by sanlock when it loses access to the storage holding leases for a VG.  It runs the command specified in lvm.conf lvmlockctl_kill_command to deactivate LVs in the VG.  If  the
              specified command is successful, locks will be dropped for the VG in lvmlockd (the equivalent of lvmlockctl --drop will be run.)  If no command is specified, or the command fails, then the
              user must intervene to forcefully deactivate LVs in the VG, and if successful, run lvmlockctl --drop.  For more, see lvmlockd(8).

       --drop This should only be run after a VG has been successfully deactivated following an lvmlockctl --kill command.  It clears the stale lockspace from lvmlockd.  When lvmlockctl_kill_command  is
              used, the --kill command may run drop automatically.  For more, see lvmlockd(8).

       --gl-enable
              This enables the global lock in a sanlock VG.  This is necessary if the VG that previously held the global lock is removed.  For more, see lvmlockd(8).

       --gl-disable
              This  disables  the  global  lock in a sanlock VG.  This is necessary if the global lock has mistakenly been enabled in more than one VG.  The global lock should be disabled in all but one
              sanlock VG.  For more, see lvmlockd(8).

       --stop-lockspaces
              This tells lvmlockd to stop all lockspaces.  It can be useful to stop lockspaces for VGs that the vgchange --lock-stop command can no longer see, or to stop the dlm global lockspace  which
              is not directly stopped by the vgchange command.  The wait and force options can be used with this command.
