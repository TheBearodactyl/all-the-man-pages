NAME
       pulse-daemon.conf - PulseAudio daemon configuration file

SYNOPSIS
       ~/.config/pulse/daemon.conf

       ~/.config/pulse/daemon.conf.d/*.conf

       /etc/pulse/daemon.conf

       /etc/pulse/daemon.conf.d/*.conf

DESCRIPTION
       The  PulseAudio sound server reads configuration directives from a con‐
       figuration file on startup. If the per-user  file  ~/.config/pulse/dae‐
       mon.conf  exists,  it  is used, otherwise the system configuration file
       /etc/pulse/daemon.conf is used. In addition to those main  files,  con‐
       figuration  directives  can  also  be  put  in  files under directories
       ~/.config/pulse/daemon.conf.d/  and  /etc/pulse/daemon.conf.d/.   Those
       files  have  to  have  the .conf file name extension, but otherwise the
       file names can be chosen freely. The files under daemon.conf.d are pro‐
       cessed  in alphabetical order. In case the same option is set in multi‐
       ple files, the last file to set an option overrides earlier files.  The
       main daemon.conf file is processed first, so options set in files under
       daemon.conf.d override the main file.

       Please note that the  server  also  reads  a  configuration  script  on
       startup. See default.pa(5).

       The configuration file is a simple collection of variable declarations.
       If the configuration file parser encounters either ; or  #  it  ignores
       the rest of the line until its end.

       For  the settings that take a boolean argument the values true, yes, on
       and 1 are equivalent, resp. false, no, off, 0.

GENERAL DIRECTIVES
       daemonize= Daemonize after startup. Takes a boolean value, defaults  to
       no. The --daemonize command line option takes precedence.

       fail=  Fail  to  start up if any of the directives in the configuration
       script default.pa fail. Takes a boolean argument, defaults to yes.  The
       --fail command line option takes precedence.

       allow-module-loading= Allow/disallow module loading after startup. This
       is a security feature that if disabled makes sure that no further  mod‐
       ules  may be loaded into the PulseAudio server after startup completed.
       It is recommended to disable  this  when  system-instance  is  enabled.
       Please  note that certain features like automatic hot-plug support will
       not work if this option is enabled. Takes a boolean argument,  defaults
       to  yes. The --disallow-module-loading command line option takes prece‐
       dence.

       allow-exit= Allow/disallow exit on user request. Defaults to yes.

       resample-method= The resampling algorithm to use. Use one of  src-sinc-
       best-quality,  src-sinc-medium-quality,  src-sinc-fastest, src-zero-or‐
       der-hold, src-linear, trivial,  speex-float-N,  speex-fixed-N,  ffmpeg,
       soxr-mq,  soxr-hq, soxr-vhq. See the documentation of libsamplerate and
       speex for explanations of the different src- and  speex-  methods,  re‐
       spectively. The method trivial is the most basic algorithm implemented.
       If you're tight on CPU consider using this. On the other  hand  it  has
       the  worst  quality  of  them all. The Speex resamplers take an integer
       quality setting in the range 0..10  (bad...good).  They  exist  in  two
       flavours:  fixed  and  float.  The former uses fixed point numbers, the
       latter relies on floating point numbers. On most desktop CPUs the float
       point  resampler  is  a  lot faster, and it also offers slightly better
       quality. The soxr-family methods are based on libsoxr, a resampler  li‐
       brary  from  the  SoX  sound processing utility. The mq variant has the
       best performance of the three. The hq is more expensive and,  according
       to  SoX developers, is considered the best choice for audio of up to 16
       bits per sample. The vhq variant has more precision than hq and is more
       suitable for larger samples. The Soxr resamplers generally offer better
       quality at less CPU compared to other resamplers, such  as  speex.  The
       downside  is  that they can add a significant delay to the output (usu‐
       ally up to around 20 ms, in rare cases more). See the output  of  dump-
       resample-methods  for  a complete list of all available resamplers. De‐
       faults to speex-float-1.  The  --resample-method  command  line  option
       takes precedence. Note that some modules overwrite or allow overwriting
       of the resampler to use.

       avoid-resampling= If set, try to configure the device to  avoid  resam‐
       pling.  This  only  works  on devices which support reconfiguring their
       rate, and when no other streams are already playing or capturing audio.
       The  device will also not be configured to a rate less than the default
       and alternate sample rates.

       enable-remixing= If disabled never upmix or downmix channels to differ‐
       ent  channel  maps.  Instead, do a simple name-based matching only. De‐
       faults to yes. There is no known valid use case for setting this option
       to no, therefore, this option is deprecated and may be removed in a fu‐
       ture version of PulseAudio.

       remixing-use-all-sink-channels= If enabled, use all sink channels  when
       remixing.  Otherwise,  remix to the minimal set of sink channels needed
       to reproduce all of the source channels. (This has  no  effect  on  LFE
       remixing.) Defaults to yes.

       enable-lfe-remixing=  This  is  a  way  to set remixing-produce-lfe and
       remixing-consume-lfe to the same value at once. This option only exists
       for  backward  compatibility  and may be removed in a future version of
       PulseAudio.

       remixing-produce-lfe= If enabled, and the sink input does not have  the
       LFE  channel, synthesize the output LFE channel as a (lowpass-filtered,
       if lfe-crossover-freq is not 0) average of all  input  channels.  Also,
       when lfe-crossover-freq is not 0, filter out low frequencies from other
       channels while producing a synthetic LFE output. If disabled, the  out‐
       put  LFE  channel  will  only get a signal when an input LFE channel is
       available as well. Defaults to no.

       remixing-consume-lfe= If enabled, and the sink does  not  have  an  LFE
       channel,  redirect the input LFE channel (if any) to other channels. If
       disabled, the input LFE channel will remain unused unless the sink  has
       the LFE channel as well. Defaults to no.

       lfe-crossover-freq= The crossover frequency (in Hz) for the LFE filter.
       Set it to 0 to disable the LFE filter. Defaults to 0.

       use-pid-file= Create a PID file in  the  runtime  directory  ($XDG_RUN‐
       TIME_DIR/pulse/pid).  If  this  is  enabled  you  may use commands like
       --kill or --check. If you are planning to start more than one  PulseAu‐
       dio  process  per  user, you better disable this option since it effec‐
       tively disables multiple instances. Takes a boolean argument,  defaults
       to yes. The --use-pid-file command line option takes precedence.

       cpu-limit=  If  disabled  do  not install the CPU load limiter, even on
       platforms where it is supported. This  option  is  useful  when  debug‐
       ging/profiling  PulseAudio to disable disturbing SIGXCPU signals. Takes
       a boolean argument, defaults to no. The --no-cpu-limit command line ar‐
       gument takes precedence.

       system-instance=  Run the daemon as system-wide instance, requires root
       privileges. Takes a boolean argument, defaults to no. The --system com‐
       mand line argument takes precedence.

       local-server-type=  Please  don't use this option if you don't have to!
       This option is currently only useful when you want D-Bus clients to use
       a  remote server. This option may be removed in future versions. If you
       only want to run PulseAudio in the system mode, use the system-instance
       option.  This option takes one of user, system or none as the argument.
       This is essentially a duplicate for  the  system-instance  option.  The
       difference  is  the none option, which is useful when you want to use a
       remote server with D-Bus clients. If both this and system-instance  are
       defined, this option takes precedence. Defaults to whatever the system-
       instance is set.

       enable-shm= Enable data transfer via  POSIX  or  memfd  shared  memory.
       Takes  a  boolean  argument, defaults to yes. The --disable-shm command
       line argument takes precedence.

       enable-memfd=. Enable memfd shared memory. Takes  a  boolean  argument,
       defaults to yes.

       shm-size-bytes=  Sets the shared memory segment size for the daemon, in
       bytes. If left unspecified or is set to 0 it will default to some  sys‐
       tem-specific default, usually 64 MiB. Please note that usually there is
       no need to change this value, unless you are running an OS kernel  that
       does not do memory overcommit.

       lock-memory=  Locks  the  entire  PulseAudio process into memory. While
       this might increase drop-out safety when used in conjunction with real-
       time  scheduling  this  takes away a lot of memory from other processes
       and might hence considerably slow down your system. Defaults to no.

       flat-volumes= Enable 'flat' volumes, i.e. where possible let  the  sink
       volume  equal the maximum of the volumes of the inputs connected to it.
       Takes a boolean argument, defaults to no.

       rescue-streams= Enable rescuing of streams if the used sink  or  source
       becomes  unavailable. Takes a boolean argument. If set to yes, pulseau‐
       dio will try to move the streams from a sink or source that becomes un‐
       available  to the default sink or source. If set to no, streams will be
       killed if the corresponding sink or source disappears. Defaults to yes.

SCHEDULING
       high-priority= Renice the daemon after startup to become a  high-prior‐
       ity  process. This a good idea if you experience drop-outs during play‐
       back. However, this is a certain security issue, since  it  works  when
       called  SUID root only, or RLIMIT_NICE is used. root is dropped immedi‐
       ately after gaining the nice level on startup, thus  it  is  presumably
       safe. See pulseaudio(1) for more information. Takes a boolean argument,
       defaults to yes. The --high-priority command line option  takes  prece‐
       dence.

       realtime-scheduling=  Try  to  acquire SCHED_FIFO scheduling for the IO
       threads. The same security concerns as mentioned above apply.  However,
       if  PA  enters  an  endless  loop,  realtime scheduling causes a system
       lockup. Thus, realtime scheduling should only be enabled on trusted ma‐
       chines  for now. Please note that only the IO threads of PulseAudio are
       made real-time. The controlling thread is  left  a  normally  scheduled
       thread.  Thus  enabling  the  high-priority  option  is orthogonal. See
       pulseaudio(1) for more information. Takes a boolean argument,  defaults
       to yes. The --realtime command line option takes precedence.

       realtime-priority= The realtime priority to acquire, if realtime-sched‐
       uling is enabled. Note: JACK uses 10 by default, 9 for clients. Thus it
       is  recommended  to  choose  the PulseAudio real-time priorities lower.
       Some PulseAudio threads might choose  a  priority  a  little  lower  or
       higher than the specified value. Defaults to 5.

       nice-level=  The nice level to acquire for the daemon, if high-priority
       is enabled. Note: on some distributions X11 uses -10  by  default.  De‐
       faults to -11.

IDLE TIMES
       exit-idle-time=  Terminate  the  daemon  after the last client quit and
       this time in seconds passed. Use a negative value to disable this  fea‐
       ture.  Defaults  to  20. The --exit-idle-time command line option takes
       precedence.

              When PulseAudio runs in the per-user mode and  detects  a  login
              session,  then  any  positive  value  will be reset to 0 so that
              PulseAudio will terminate  immediately  on  logout.  A  positive
              value therefore has effect only in environments where there's no
              support for login session tracking (or if the user is logged  in
              without  a  session spawned, a.k.a. lingering). A negative value
              can still be used to disable any automatic exit.

              When PulseAudio runs in the system mode, automatic exit  is  al‐
              ways disabled, so this option does nothing.

       scache-idle-time=  Unload  autoloaded  sample cache entries after being
       idle for this time in seconds. Defaults to 20.  The  --scache-idle-time
       command line option takes precedence.

PATHS
       dl-search-path=  The  path  where  to  look  for dynamic shared objects
       (DSOs/plugins). You may specify more than one path separated by colons.
       The default path depends on compile time settings. The --dl-search-path
       command line option takes precedence.

       default-script-file= The default configuration  script  file  to  load.
       Specify  an empty string for not loading a default script file. The de‐
       fault behaviour is to load ~/.config/pulse/default.pa, and if that file
       does  not  exist  fall  back  to  the  system  wide  installed  version
       /etc/pulse/default.pa.  If   run   in   system-wide   mode   the   file
       /etc/pulse/system.pa  is  used  instead. If -n is passed on the command
       line or default-script-file=  is  disabled  the  default  configuration
       script is ignored.

       load-default-script-file= Load the default configuration script file as
       specified in default-script-file=. Defaults to yes.

LOGGING
       log-target= The default log target. Use either stderr, syslog,  journal
       (optional),  auto,  file:PATH  or  newfile:PATH. On traditional systems
       auto is equivalent to  syslog.  On  systemd-enabled  systems,  auto  is
       equivalent to journal, in case daemonize is enabled, and to stderr oth‐
       erwise. If set to file:PATH, logging is directed to the file  indicated
       by  PATH. newfile:PATH is otherwise the same as file:PATH, but existing
       files are never overwritten. If the specified file  already  exists,  a
       suffix  is  added  to  the  file name to avoid overwriting. Defaults to
       auto. The --log-target command line option takes precedence.

       log-level= Log level, one of debug, info, notice, warning,  error.  Log
       messages with a lower log level than specified here are not logged. De‐
       faults to notice. The --log-level command line option takes precedence.
       The -v command line option might alter this setting.

       log-meta=  With  each  logged message log the code location the message
       was generated from. Defaults to no.

       log-time= With each logged message log the relative time since startup.
       Defaults to no.

       log-backtrace= When greater than 0, with each logged message log a code
       stack trace up the specified number of stack frames. Defaults to 0.

RESOURCE LIMITS
       See getrlimit(2) for more information. Set to -1  if  PulseAudio  shall
       not  touch the resource limit. Not all resource limits are available on
       all operating systems.

       rlimit-as Defaults to -1.

       rlimit-rss Defaults to -1.

       rlimit-core Defaults to -1.

       rlimit-data Defaults to -1.

       rlimit-fsize Defaults to -1.

       rlimit-nofile Defaults to 256.

       rlimit-stack Defaults to -1.

       rlimit-nproc Defaults to -1.

       rlimit-locks Defaults to -1.

       rlimit-sigpending Defaults to -1.

       rlimit-msgqueue Defaults to -1.

       rlimit-memlock Defaults to 16 KiB. Please note that the JACK client li‐
       braries may require more locked memory.

       rlimit-nice  Defaults  to  31.  Please  make sure that the default nice
       level as configured with nice-level fits in  this  resource  limit,  if
       high-priority is enabled.

       rlimit-rtprio  Defaults  to  9. Please make sure that the default real-
       time priority level as configured with realtime-priority= fits in  this
       resource  limit, if realtime-scheduling is enabled. The JACK client li‐
       braries require a real-time priority of 9 by default.

       rlimit-rttime Defaults to 1000000.

DEFAULT DEVICE SETTINGS
       Most drivers try to open the audio device with these settings and  then
       fall back to lower settings. The default settings are CD quality: 16bit
       native endian, 2 channels, 44100 Hz sampling.

       default-sample-format=    The    default    sampling    format.     See
       https://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/PulseAudio/Documenta‐
       tion/User/SupportedAudioFormats/ for possible values.

       default-sample-rate= The default sample frequency.

       default-sample-channels The default number of channels.

       default-channel-map The default channel map.

       alternate-sample-rate The alternate sample frequency. Sinks and sources
       will  use either the default-sample-rate value or this alternate value,
       typically 44.1 or 48kHz. Switching between default and alternate values
       is  enabled  only  when the sinks/sources are suspended. This option is
       ignored in passthrough mode where the stream rate will be used. If  set
       to the same value as the default sample rate, this feature is disabled.

DEFAULT FRAGMENT SETTINGS
       Some hardware drivers require the hardware playback buffer to be subdi‐
       vided into several fragments. It is possible  to  change  these  buffer
       metrics  for  machines with high scheduling latencies. Not all possible
       values that may be configured here are available in all  hardware.  The
       driver  will  find  the  nearest setting supported. Modern drivers that
       support timer-based scheduling ignore these options.

       default-fragments= The default number of fragments. Defaults to 4.

       default-fragment-size-msec=The duration of a single fragment.  Defaults
       to 25ms (i.e. the total buffer is thus 100ms long).

DEFAULT DEFERRED VOLUME SETTINGS
       With  the flat volume feature enabled, the sink HW volume is set to the
       same level as the highest volume input stream. Any other streams  (with
       lower  volumes)  have the appropriate adjustment applied in SW to bring
       them to the correct overall level. Sadly hardware mixer changes  cannot
       be timed accurately and thus this change of volumes can sometimes cause
       the resulting output sound to be momentarily too loud or too  soft.  So
       to  ensure  SW  and  HW  volumes  are  applied concurrently without any
       glitches, their application needs to be synchronized. The  sink  imple‐
       mentation  needs  to support deferred volumes. The following parameters
       can be used to refine the process.

       enable-deferred-volume= Enable deferred volume for the sinks that  sup‐
       port it. This feature is enabled by default.

       deferred-volume-safety-margin-usec=  The  amount  of  time (in usec) by
       which the HW volume increases are delayed and HW volume  decreases  are
       advanced. Defaults to 8000 usec.

       deferred-volume-extra-delay-usec= The amount of time (in usec) by which
       HW volume changes are delayed. Negative values are  also  allowed.  De‐
       faults to 0.
