NAME
       EVP_rc2_cbc, EVP_rc2_cfb, EVP_rc2_cfb64, EVP_rc2_ecb, EVP_rc2_ofb, EVP_rc2_40_cbc, EVP_rc2_64_cbc - EVP RC2 cipher

SYNOPSIS
        #include <openssl/evp.h>

        const EVP_CIPHER *EVP_rc2_cbc(void);
        const EVP_CIPHER *EVP_rc2_cfb(void);
        const EVP_CIPHER *EVP_rc2_cfb64(void);
        const EVP_CIPHER *EVP_rc2_ecb(void);
        const EVP_CIPHER *EVP_rc2_ofb(void);
        const EVP_CIPHER *EVP_rc2_40_cbc(void);
        const EVP_CIPHER *EVP_rc2_64_cbc(void);

DESCRIPTION
       The RC2 encryption algorithm for EVP.

       EVP_rc2_cbc(), EVP_rc2_cfb(), EVP_rc2_cfb64(), EVP_rc2_ecb(), EVP_rc2_ofb()
           RC2 encryption algorithm in CBC, CFB, ECB and OFB modes respectively. This is a variable key length cipher with an additional parameter called "effective key bits" or "effective key length".
           By default both are set to 128 bits.

       EVP_rc2_40_cbc(), EVP_rc2_64_cbc()
           RC2 algorithm in CBC mode with a default key length and effective key length of 40 and 64 bits.

           WARNING: these functions are obsolete. Their usage should be replaced with the EVP_rc2_cbc(), EVP_CIPHER_CTX_set_key_length() and EVP_CIPHER_CTX_ctrl() functions to set the key length and
           effective key length.

RETURN VALUES
       These functions return an EVP_CIPHER structure that contains the implementation of the symmetric cipher. See EVP_CIPHER_meth_new(3) for details of the EVP_CIPHER structure.
