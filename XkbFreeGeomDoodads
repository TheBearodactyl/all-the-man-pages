NAME
       XkbFreeGeomDoodads - Free geometry doodads

SYNOPSIS
       void XkbFreeGeomDoodads (XkbDoodadPtr doodads, int count, Bool free_all);

ARGUMENTS
       doodads
              doodads to be freed

       count  number of doodads to be freed

       free_all
              True => all doodads are freed

DESCRIPTION
       Xkb  provides a number of functions to allocate and free subcomponents of a keyboard geometry. Use these functions to create or modify keyboard geometries.  Note that these functions merely allo‚Äê
       cate space for the new element(s), and it is up to you to fill in the values explicitly in your code. These allocation functions increase sz_* but never touch num_* (unless there is an allocation
       failure,  in which case they reset both sz_* and num_* to zero). These functions return Success if they succeed, BadAlloc if they are not able to allocate space, or BadValue if a parameter is not
       as expected.

       If free_all is True, all doodads in the array are freed, regardless of the value of count.  Otherwise, count doodads are freed.

RETURN VALUES
       Success        The XkbFreeGeomDoodads function returns Success if there are no allocation errors.

DIAGNOSTICS
       BadAlloc       Unable to allocate storage

       BadValue       An argument is out of range
