NAME
       Xwayland - an X server for running X clients under Wayland.

SYNOPSIS
       Xwayland [option ...]

DESCRIPTION
       Xwayland is an X server and a Wayland client. It plays the role of a proxy between legacy X clients which do not support the Wayland protocols and the Wayland server.

       Usually,  Xwayland  is spawned automatically by the Wayland server and runs rootless so that X clients integrate seamlessly with the rest of the Wayland desktop. It is however possible for a user
       to launch Xwayland non-rootless, mainly for testing purposes.

       Like all of the X servers, Xwayland accepts the command line options described in the Xserver(7) manual page.  The following additional arguments are supported as well.

       -decorate
               Add decorations to the Xwayland root window when running rootful.

               This option has no effect when Xwayland is built without libdecor support (optional).

               This option is not compatible with rootless mode (-rootless).

       -eglstream
               Use EGLStream backend for NVidia GPUs. If Xwayland was compiled with EGLStream support, this option will instruct Xwayland to try that backend first, then fallback to the GBM  backend  if
               EGLStream is not supported by the Wayland server. Without this option, Xwayland tries the GBM backend first, and fallback to EGLStream if GBM is not usable.

       -fullscreen
               Set the Xwayland window fullscreen when running rootful.

               This option is not compatible with rootless mode (-rootless).

       -geometry WxH
               Sets the geometry of the Xwayland window to WxH when running rootful.

               This option is not compatible with rootless mode (-rootless).

       -host-grab
               Disable host keyboard shorcuts and confine the pointer when running rootful.

               This feature relies on the protocol for inhibiting the compositor keyboard shortcuts and on the protocol for pointer locking and confinement and may have no effect if the Wayland composi‚Äê
               tor in use does not support these protocols.

               Use the keys [CTRL]+[SHIFT] simultaneously to release the keyboard and pointer devices.

               This option is not compatible with rootless mode (-rootless).

       -initfd fd
               Add the given fd as a listen socket for initialization of X clients.  This options is aimed at Wayland servers which run Xwayland on-demand, to be able to spawn specific X  clients  which
               need to complete before other regular X clients can connect to Xwayland, like xrdb.

       -listen fd
               deprecated, use -listenfd instead.

       -listenfd fd
               Add given fd as a listen socket. This option is used by the Wayland server to pass Xwayland the socket where X clients connect.

       -noTouchPointerEmulation
               Disable touch pointer emulation. This allows the Wayland compositor to implement its own pointer emulation mechanism for X11 clients that don't support touch input.

       -force-xrandr-emulation
               Force additional non-native modes to be exposed when viewporter is not supported by the Wayland compositor.

       -rootless
               Run Xwayland rootless, so that X clients integrate seamlessly with Wayland clients in a Wayland desktop. That requires the Wayland server to be an X window manager as well.

       -shm    Force the shared memory backend instead of glamor (if available) for passing buffers to the Wayland server.

       -verbose [n]
               Sets  the  verbosity level for information printed on stderr.  If the n value isn't supplied, each occurrence of this option increments the verbosity level.  When the n value is supplied,
               the verbosity level is set to that value.  The default verbosity level is 0.

       -version
               Show the server version and exit.

       -wm fd  This option is used by the Wayland server to pass Xwayland the socket where the X window manager client connects, when Xwayland is running with -rootless.

ENVIRONMENT
       WAYLAND_DISPLAY
               the name of the display of the Wayland server.

       XWAYLAND_NO_GLAMOR
               disable glamor and DRI3 support in Xwayland, for testing purposes.
