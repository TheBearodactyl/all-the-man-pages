NAME
       Pod::Perldoc::ToChecker - let Perldoc check Pod for errors

SYNOPSIS
         % perldoc -o checker SomeFile.pod
         No Pod errors in SomeFile.pod
         (or an error report)

DESCRIPTION
       This is a "plug-in" class that allows Perldoc to use
       Pod::Simple::Checker as a "formatter" class (or if that is not
       available, then Pod::Checker), to check for errors in a given Pod file.

       This is actually a Pod::Simple::Checker (or Pod::Checker) subclass, and
       inherits all its options.
