NAME
       gnutls_load_file - API function

SYNOPSIS
       #include <gnutls/gnutls.h>

       int gnutls_load_file(const char * filename, gnutls_datum_t * data);

ARGUMENTS
       const char * filename
                   the name of the file to load

       gnutls_datum_t * data

DESCRIPTION
       This function will load a file into a datum. The data are zero terminated but the terminating null is not included in length.  The returned data are allocated using gnutls_malloc().

       Note  that this function is not designed for reading sensitive materials, such as private keys, on practical applications. When the reading fails in the middle, the partially loaded content might
       remain on memory.

RETURNS
       On success, GNUTLS_E_SUCCESS (0) is returned, otherwise an error code is returned.

       Since 3.1.0
