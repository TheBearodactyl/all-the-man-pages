NAME
       gnutls_priority_set_direct - API function

SYNOPSIS
       #include <gnutls/gnutls.h>

       int gnutls_priority_set_direct(gnutls_session_t session, const char * priorities, const char ** err_pos);

ARGUMENTS
       gnutls_session_t session
                   is a gnutls_session_t type.

       const char * priorities
                   is a string describing priorities

       const char ** err_pos
                   In case of an error this will have the position in the string the error occurred

DESCRIPTION
       Sets the priorities to use on the ciphers, key exchange methods, and macs.  This function avoids keeping a priority cache and is used to directly set string priorities to a TLS session.  For doc‐
       umentation check the gnutls_priority_init().

       To use a reasonable default, consider using gnutls_set_default_priority(), or gnutls_set_default_priority_append() instead of this function.

RETURNS
       On syntax error GNUTLS_E_INVALID_REQUEST is returned, GNUTLS_E_SUCCESS on success, or an error code.
