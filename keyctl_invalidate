NAME
       keyctl_invalidate - invalidate a key

SYNOPSIS
       #include <keyutils.h>

       long keyctl_invalidate(key_serial_t key);

DESCRIPTION
       keyctl_invalidate() invalidates a key.  The key is scheduled for immediate removal from all the keyrings that point to it, after which it will be deleted.  The key will be ignored by all searches
       once this function is called even if it is not yet fully dealt with.

       The caller must have search permission on a key to be able to invalidate it.

RETURN VALUE
       On success keyctl_invalidate() returns 0.  On error, the value -1 will be returned and errno will have been set to an appropriate error.

ERRORS
       ENOKEY The key specified is invalid.

       EKEYEXPIRED
              The key specified has expired.

       EKEYREVOKED
              The key specified had been revoked.

       EACCES The key exists, but is not searchable by the calling process.

LINKING
       This is a library function that can be found in libkeyutils.  When linking, -lkeyutils should be specified to the linker.
