NAME
       xcb_open_font - opens a font

SYNOPSIS
       #include <xcb/xproto.h>

   Request function
       xcb_void_cookie_t xcb_open_font(xcb_connection_t *conn, xcb_font_t fid, uint16_t name_len, const char *name);

REQUEST ARGUMENTS
       conn      The XCB connection to X11.

       fid       The ID with which you will refer to the font, created by xcb_generate_id.

       name_len  Length (in bytes) of name.

       name      A pattern describing an X core font.

DESCRIPTION
       Opens any X core font matching the given name (for example "-misc-fixed-*").

       Note that X core fonts are deprecated (but still supported) in favor of client-side rendering using Xft.

RETURN VALUE
       Returns an xcb_void_cookie_t. Errors (if any) have to be handled in the event loop.

       If you want to handle errors directly with xcb_request_check instead, use xcb_open_font_checked. See xcb-requests(3) for details.

ERRORS
       xcb_name_error_t
                 No font matches the given name.
