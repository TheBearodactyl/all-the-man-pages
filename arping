NAME
       arping - send ARP REQUEST to a neighbour host

SYNOPSIS
       arping [-AbDfhqUV] [-c count] [-w deadline] [-i interval] [-s source] [-I interface] {destination}

DESCRIPTION
       Ping destination on device interface by ARP packets, using source address source.

       arping supports IPv4 addresses only. For IPv6, see ndisc6(8).

OPTIONS
       -A
           The same as -U, but ARP REPLY packets used instead of ARP REQUEST.

       -b
           Send only MAC level broadcasts. Normally arping starts from sending broadcast, and switch to unicast after reply received.

       -c count
           Stop after sending count ARP REQUEST packets. With deadline option, instead wait for count ARP REPLY packets, or until the timeout expires.

       -D
           Duplicate address detection mode (DAD). See RFC2131, 4.4.1. Returns 0, if DAD succeeded i.e. no replies are received.

       -f
           Finish after the first reply confirming that target is alive.

       -I interface
           Name of network device where to send ARP REQUEST packets.

       -h
           Print help page and exit.

       -q
           Quiet output. Nothing is displayed.

       -s source
           IP source address to use in ARP packets. If this option is absent, source address is:

               • In DAD mode (with option -D) set to 0.0.0.0.

               • In Unsolicited ARP mode (with options -U or -A) set to destination.

               • Otherwise, it is calculated from routing tables.

       -U
           Unsolicited ARP mode to update neighbours' ARP caches. No replies are expected.

       -V
           Print version of the program and exit.

       -w deadline
           Specify a timeout, in seconds, before arping exits regardless of how many packets have been sent or received. If any replies are received, exit with status 0, otherwise status 1. When
           combined with the count option, exit with status 0 if count replies are received before the deadline expiration, otherwise status 1.

       -i interval
           Specify an interval, in seconds, between packets.

SECURITY
       arping requires CAP_NET_RAW capability to be executed. It is not recommended to be used as set-uid root, because it allows user to modify ARP caches of neighbour hosts.

AVAILABILITY
       arping is part of iputils package.
