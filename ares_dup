NAME
       ares_dup - Duplicate a resolver channel

SYNOPSIS
       #include <ares.h>

       int ares_dup(ares_channel *dest, ares_channel source)

DESCRIPTION
       The ares_dup(3) function duplicates an existing communications channel for name service lookups.  If it returns successfully, ares_dup(3) will set the variable pointed to by dest to a handle used
       to identify the name service channel.  The caller should invoke ares_destroy(3) on the handle when the channel is no longer needed.

SEE ALSO
