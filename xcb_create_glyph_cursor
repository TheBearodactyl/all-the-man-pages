NAME
       xcb_create_glyph_cursor - create cursor

SYNOPSIS
       #include <xcb/xproto.h>

   Request function
       xcb_void_cookie_t xcb_create_glyph_cursor(xcb_connection_t *conn, xcb_cursor_t cid, xcb_font_t source_font, xcb_font_t mask_font, uint16_t source_char, uint16_t mask_char, uint16_t fore_red,
              uint16_t fore_green, uint16_t fore_blue, uint16_t back_red, uint16_t back_green, uint16_t back_blue);

REQUEST ARGUMENTS
       conn      The XCB connection to X11.

       cid       The ID with which you will refer to the cursor, created by xcb_generate_id.

       source_font
                 In which font to look for the cursor glyph.

       mask_font In which font to look for the mask glyph.

       source_char
                 The glyph of source_font to use.

       mask_char The glyph of mask_font to use as a mask: Pixels which are set to 1 define which source pixels are displayed. All pixels which are set to 0 are not displayed.

       fore_red  The red value of the foreground color.

       fore_green
                 The green value of the foreground color.

       fore_blue The blue value of the foreground color.

       back_red  The red value of the background color.

       back_green
                 The green value of the background color.

       back_blue The blue value of the background color.

DESCRIPTION
       Creates a cursor from a font glyph. X provides a set of standard cursor shapes in a special font named cursor. Applications are encouraged to use this interface for their cursors because the font
       can be customized for the individual display type.

       All pixels which are set to 1 in the source will use the foreground color (as specified by fore_red, fore_green and fore_blue). All pixels set to 0 will use the background color (as specified by
       back_red, back_green and back_blue).

RETURN VALUE
       Returns an xcb_void_cookie_t. Errors (if any) have to be handled in the event loop.

       If you want to handle errors directly with xcb_request_check instead, use xcb_create_glyph_cursor_checked. See xcb-requests(3) for details.

ERRORS
       xcb_alloc_error_t
                 The X server could not allocate the requested resources (no memory?).

       xcb_font_error_t
                 The specified source_font or mask_font does not exist.

       xcb_value_error_t
                 Either source_char or mask_char are not defined in source_font or mask_font, respectively.
