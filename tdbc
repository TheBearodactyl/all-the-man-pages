DESCRIPTION
       Tcl  Database  Connectivity (TDBC) is a common interface for Tcl programs to access SQL databases. It is implemented by a series of database drivers: separate modules, each of which adapts Tcl to
       the interface of one particular database system.  All of the drivers implement a common series of commands for manipulating the database.  These commands are all named dynamically, since they all
       represent  objects  in  the  database system. They include connections, which represent connections to a database; statements, which represent SQL statements, and result sets, which represent the
       sets of rows that result from executing statements. All of these have manual pages of their own, listed under SEE ALSO.

       In addition, TDBC itself has a few service procedures that are chiefly of interest to driver writers. SEE ALSO also enumerates them.
