NAME
       asn1_bit_der - API function

SYNOPSIS
       #include <libtasn1.h>

       void asn1_bit_der(const unsigned char * str, int bit_len, unsigned char * der, int * der_len);

ARGUMENTS
       const unsigned char * str
                   BIT string.

       int bit_len number of meaningful bits in STR.

       unsigned char * der
                   string returned.

       int * der_len
                   number of meaningful bytes of DER (der[0]..der[ans_len-1]).

DESCRIPTION
       Creates a length-value DER encoding for the input data as it would have been for a BIT STRING.  The DER encoded data will be copied in  der .

       Note that the BIT STRING tag is not included in the output.

       This  function  does  not  return  any  value because it is expected that  der_len will contain enough bytes to store the string plus the DER encoding. The DER encoding size can be obtained using
       asn1_length_der().
