NAME
       Test2::Event::V2 - Second generation event.

DESCRIPTION
       This is the event type that should be used instead of Test2::Event or its legacy subclasses.

SYNOPSIS
   USING A CONTEXT
           use Test2::API qw/context/;

           sub my_tool {
               my $ctx = context();

               my $event = $ctx->send_ev2(info => [{tag => 'NOTE', details => "This is a note"}]);

               $ctx->release;

               return $event;
           }

   USING THE CONSTRUCTOR
           use Test2::Event::V2;

           my $e = Test2::Event::V2->new(
               trace => {frame => [$PKG, $FILE, $LINE, $SUBNAME]},
               info  => [{tag => 'NOTE', details => "This is a note"}],
           );

METHODS
       This class inherits from Test2::Event.

       $fd = $e->facet_data()
           This will return a hashref of facet data. Each facet hash will be a shallow copy of the original.

       $about = $e->about()
           This will return the 'about' facet hashref.

           NOTE: This will return the internal hashref, not a copy.

       $trace = $e->trace()
           This will return the 'trace' facet, normally blessed (but this is not enforced when the trace is set using "set_trace()".

           NOTE: This will return the internal trace, not a copy.

   MUTATION
       $e->add_amnesty({...})
           Inherited from Test2::Event. This can be used to add 'amnesty' facets to an existing event. Each new item is added to the END of the list.

           NOTE: Items ARE blessed when added.

       $e->add_hub({...})
           Inherited from Test2::Event. This is used by hubs to stamp events as they pass through. New items are added to the START of the list.

           NOTE: Items ARE NOT blessed when added.

       $e->set_uuid($UUID)
           Inherited from Test2::Event, overridden to also vivify/mutate the 'about' facet.

       $e->set_trace($trace)
           Inherited from Test2::Event which allows you to change the trace.

           Note: This method does not bless/clone the trace for you. Many things will expect the trace to be blessed, so you should probably do that.

   LEGACY SUPPORT METHODS
       These are all imported from Test2::Util::Facets2Legacy, see that module or Test2::Event for documentation on what they do.

THIRD PARTY META-DATA
       This object consumes Test2::Util::ExternalMeta which provides a consistent way for you to attach meta-data to instances of this class. This is useful for tools, plugins, and other extensions.
