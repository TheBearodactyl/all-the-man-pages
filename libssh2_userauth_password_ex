NAME
       libssh2_userauth_password_ex - authenticate a session with username and password

SYNOPSIS
       #include <libssh2.h>
       int libssh2_userauth_password_ex(LIBSSH2_SESSION *session,
                           const char *username,
                           unsigned int username_len,
                           const char *password,
                           unsigned int password_len,
                           LIBSSH2_PASSWD_CHANGEREQ_FUNC((*passwd_change_cb)));

       #define libssh2_userauth_password(session, username, password) \
        libssh2_userauth_password_ex((session), (username), \
                                     strlen(username), \
                                     (password), strlen(password), NULL)

DESCRIPTION
       session - Session instance as returned by libssh2_session_init_ex(3)

       username - Name of user to attempt plain password authentication for.

       username_len - Length of username parameter.

       password - Password to use for authenticating username.

       password_len - Length of password parameter.

       passwd_change_cb - If the host accepts authentication but requests that the password be changed, this callback will be issued.  If no callback is defined, but server required password change, au‐
       thentication will fail.

       Attempt basic password authentication. Note that many SSH servers which appear to support ordinary password authentication actually have it disabled and use  Keyboard  Interactive  authentication
       (routed via PAM or another authentication backed) instead.

RETURN VALUE
       Return 0 on success or negative on failure.  It returns LIBSSH2_ERROR_EAGAIN when it would otherwise block. While LIBSSH2_ERROR_EAGAIN is a negative number, it isn't really a failure per se.

ERRORS
       Some of the errors this function may return include:

       LIBSSH2_ERROR_ALLOC -  An internal memory allocation call failed.

       LIBSSH2_ERROR_SOCKET_SEND - Unable to send data on socket.

       LIBSSH2_ERROR_PASSWORD_EXPIRED -

       IBSSH2_ERROR_AUTHENTICATION_FAILED - failed, invalid username/password or public/private key.
