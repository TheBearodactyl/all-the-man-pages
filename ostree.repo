NAME
       ostree.repo - OSTree repository configuration and layout

DESCRIPTION
       An OSTree repository is structurally similar to a git repository; it is
       a content-addressed object store containing filesystem trees. However,
       unlike git, ostree is designed to store operating system binaries. It
       records the Unix uid and gid, permissions, as well as extended
       attributes.

       A repository can be in one of three modes; bare, which is designed as a
       hard link source for operating system checkouts, bare-user, which is
       like bare but works on systems that run as non-root as well as non-root
       containers, and archive-z2, which is designed for static HTTP servers.

       There is a system repository located at /ostree/repo. If no repository
       is specified -- either by a command-line option or the OSTREE_REPO
       environment variable -- the ostree as well as many API calls will use
       it by default.

COMPONENTS OF A REPOSITORY
       The only user-editable component is the config file. For more
       information, see ostree.repo-config(5).
