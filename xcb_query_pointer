NAME
       xcb_query_pointer - get pointer coordinates

SYNOPSIS
       #include <xcb/xproto.h>

   Request function
       xcb_query_pointer_cookie_t xcb_query_pointer(xcb_connection_t *conn, xcb_window_t window);

   Reply datastructure
       typedef struct xcb_query_pointer_reply_t {
           uint8_t      response_type;
           uint8_t      same_screen;
           uint16_t     sequence;
           uint32_t     length;
           xcb_window_t root;

           int16_t      win_y;
           uint16_t     mask;

       } xcb_query_pointer_reply_t;

   Reply function
       xcb_query_pointer_reply_t *xcb_query_pointer_reply(xcb_connection_t *conn, xcb_query_pointer_cookie_t cookie, xcb_generic_error_t **e);

REQUEST ARGUMENTS
       conn      The XCB connection to X11.

       window    A window to check if the pointer is on the same screen as window (see the same_screen field in the reply).

REPLY FIELDS
       response_type
                 The type of this reply, in this case XCB_QUERY_POINTER. This field is also present in the xcb_generic_reply_t and can be used to tell replies apart from each other.

       sequence  The sequence number of the last request processed by the X11 server.

       length    The length of the reply, in words (a word is 4 bytes).

       same_screen
                 If same_screen is False, then the pointer is not on the same screen as the argument window, child is None, and win_x and win_y are zero. If same_screen is True, then win_x and win_y are
                 the pointer coordinates relative to the argument window's origin, and child is the child containing the pointer, if any.

       root      The root window the pointer is logically on.

       child     The child window containing the pointer, if any, if same_screen is true. If same_screen is false, XCB_NONE is returned.

       root_x    The pointer X position, relative to root.

       root_y    The pointer Y position, relative to root.

       win_x     The pointer X coordinate, relative to child, if same_screen is true. Zero otherwise.

       win_y     The pointer Y coordinate, relative to child, if same_screen is true. Zero otherwise.

       mask      The current logical state of the modifier keys and the buttons. Note that the logical state of a device (as seen by means of the protocol) may lag the physical state if device event
                 processing is frozen.

DESCRIPTION
       Gets the root window the pointer is logically on and the pointer coordinates relative to the root window's origin.

RETURN VALUE
       Returns an xcb_query_pointer_cookie_t. Errors have to be handled when calling the reply function xcb_query_pointer_reply.

       If you want to handle errors in the event loop instead, use xcb_query_pointer_unchecked. See xcb-requests(3) for details.

ERRORS
       xcb_window_error_t
                 The specified window does not exist.
