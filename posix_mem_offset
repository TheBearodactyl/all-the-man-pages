POSIX_MEM_OFFSET(3P)       POSIX Programmer's Manual      POSIX_MEM_OFFSET(3P)

PROLOG
       This  manual  page is part of the POSIX Programmer's Manual.  The Linux
       implementation of this interface may differ (consult the  corresponding
       Linux  manual page for details of Linux behavior), or the interface may
       not be implemented on Linux.

NAME
       posix_mem_offset — find offset and length  of  a  mapped  typed  memory
       block (ADVANCED REALTIME)

SYNOPSIS
       #include <sys/mman.h>

       int posix_mem_offset(const void *restrict addr, size_t len,
           off_t *restrict off, size_t *restrict contig_len,
           int *restrict fildes);

DESCRIPTION
       The posix_mem_offset() function shall return in the variable pointed to
       by off a value that identifies the offset (or location), within a  mem‐
       ory object, of the memory block currently mapped at addr.  The function
       shall return in the variable pointed to by fildes, the descriptor  used
       (via mmap()) to establish the mapping which contains addr.  If that de‐
       scriptor was closed since the mapping  was  established,  the  returned
       value  of  fildes shall be -1. The len argument specifies the length of
       the block of the memory object the user wishes the offset for; upon re‐
       turn, the value pointed to by contig_len shall equal either len, or the
       length of the largest contiguous block of the  memory  object  that  is
       currently  mapped to the calling process starting at addr, whichever is
       smaller.

       If the memory object mapped at addr is a typed memory object,  then  if
       the  off  and  contig_len values obtained by calling posix_mem_offset()
       are used in a call to mmap() with a file descriptor that refers to  the
       same  memory  pool as fildes (either through the same port or through a
       different   port),   and   that   was   opened   with    neither    the
       POSIX_TYPED_MEM_ALLOCATE  nor the POSIX_TYPED_MEM_ALLOCATE_CONTIG flag,
       the typed memory area that is mapped shall be  exactly  the  same  area
       that was mapped at addr in the address space of the process that called
       posix_mem_offset().

       If the memory object specified by fildes is not a typed memory  object,
       then the behavior of this function is implementation-defined.

RETURN VALUE
       Upon  successful  completion, the posix_mem_offset() function shall re‐
       turn zero; otherwise, the corresponding error status value shall be re‐
       turned.

ERRORS
       The posix_mem_offset() function shall fail if:

       EACCES The  process  has  not  mapped a memory object supported by this
              function at the given address addr.

       This function shall not return an error code of [EINTR].
