NAME
       gnutls_pcert_import_rawpk_raw - API function

SYNOPSIS
       #include <gnutls/abstract.h>

       int gnutls_pcert_import_rawpk_raw(gnutls_pcert_st * pcert, const gnutls_datum_t * rawpubkey, gnutls_x509_crt_fmt_t format, unsigned int key_usage, unsigned int flags);

ARGUMENTS
       gnutls_pcert_st * pcert
                   The pcert structure to import the data into.

       const gnutls_datum_t * rawpubkey
                   The raw public-key in gnutls_datum_t format to be imported.

       gnutls_x509_crt_fmt_t format
                   The format of the raw public-key. DER or PEM.

       unsigned int key_usage
                   An ORed sequence of GNUTLS_KEY_* flags.

       unsigned int flags
                   zero for now

DESCRIPTION
       This  convenience  function  will  import  (i.e.  convert)  the  given  raw  public  key   rawpubkey  into  a  gnutls_pcert_st  structure.  The  structure  must  be deinitialized afterwards using
       gnutls_pcert_deinit().  Note that the caller is responsible for freeing  rawpubkey . All necessary values will be copied into  pcert .

       Key usage (as defined by X.509  extension  (2.5.29.15))  can  be  explicitly  set  because  there  is  no  certificate  structure  around  the  key  to  define  this  value.  See  for  more  info
       gnutls_x509_crt_get_key_usage().

RETURNS
       On success, GNUTLS_E_SUCCESS (0) is returned, otherwise a negative error value.

SINCE
       3.6.6
