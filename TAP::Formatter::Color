TAP::Formatter::Color(3perl)                                                         Perl Programmers Reference Guide                                                         TAP::Formatter::Color(3perl)

NAME
       TAP::Formatter::Color - Run Perl test scripts with color

VERSION
       Version 3.44

DESCRIPTION
       Note that this harness is experimental.  You may not like the colors I've chosen and I haven't yet provided an easy way to override them.

       This test harness is the same as TAP::Harness, but test results are output in color.  Passing tests are printed in green.  Failing tests are in red.  Skipped tests are blue on a white background
       and TODO tests are printed in white.

       If Term::ANSIColor cannot be found (and Win32::Console::ANSI if running under Windows) tests will be run without color.

SYNOPSIS
        use TAP::Formatter::Color;
        my $harness = TAP::Formatter::Color->new( \%args );
        $harness->runtests(@tests);

METHODS
   Class Methods
       "new"

       The constructor returns a new "TAP::Formatter::Color" object. If Term::ANSIColor is not installed, returns undef.

       "can_color"

         Test::Formatter::Color->can_color()

       Returns a boolean indicating whether or not this module can actually generate colored output. This will be false if it could not load the modules needed for the current platform.

       "set_color"

       Set the output color.
