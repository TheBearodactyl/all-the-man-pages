NAME
       XGetEventData, XFreeEventData, XGenericEventCookie - retrieve and free additional event data through cookies.

SYNTAX
       Bool XGetEventData(Display *display, XGenericEventCookie *cookie);

       void XFreeEventData(Display *display, XGenericEventCookie *cookie);

ARGUMENTS
       display   Specifies the connection to the X server.

       cookie    Specifies the cookie to free or retrieve the data for.

STRUCTURES
       typedef struct {
               int type;
               unsigned long serial;
               Bool send_event;
               Display *display;
               int extension;
               int evtype;
               unsigned int cookie;
               void *data;
       } XGenericEventCookie;

DESCRIPTION
       Some  extension  XGenericEvents  require  additional  memory  to store information.  For these events, the library returns a XGenericEventCookie with a token ('cookie') unique to this event.  The
       XGenericEventCookie's data pointer is undefined until XGetEventData is called.

       The XGetEventData function retrieves this extra data for the given cookie.  No round-trip to the server is required.  If the cookie is invalid or the event is not an event handled by cookie  han‐
       dlers,  False is returned.  If XGetEventData returns True, the cookie's data pointer points to the memory containing the event information.  A client must call XFreeEventData to free this memory.
       XGetEventData returns False for multiple calls for the same event cookie.

       The XFreeEventData function frees the data associated with a cookie.  A client must call XFreeEventData for each cookie claimed with XGetEventData.

EXAMPLE CODE
       XEvent event;
       XGenericEventCookie *cookie = &ev;

       XNextEvent(display, &event);
       if (XGetEventData(display, cookie)) {
           handle_cookie_event(cookie->data);
       } else
           handle_event(&event);
       }
       XFreeEventData(display, cookie);

NOTES
       A cookie is defined as unclaimed if it has been returned to the client through XNextEvent but its data has not been retrieved via XGetEventData.  Subsequent calls to XNextEvent  may  free  memory
       associated with unclaimed cookies.  Multi-threaded X clients must ensure that XGetEventData is called before the next call to XNextEvent.
