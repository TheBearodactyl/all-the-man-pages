NAME
       CURLOPT_PREQUOTE - commands to run before an FTP transfer

SYNOPSIS
       #include <curl/curl.h>

       CURLcode curl_easy_setopt(CURL *handle, CURLOPT_PREQUOTE,
                                 struct curl_slist *cmds);

DESCRIPTION
       Pass  a pointer to a linked list of FTP commands to pass to the server after the transfer type is set. The linked list should be a fully valid list of struct curl_slist structs properly filled in
       as described for CURLOPT_QUOTE(3). Disable this operation again by setting a NULL to this option.

       These commands are not performed when a directory listing is performed, only for file transfers.

       While CURLOPT_QUOTE(3) and CURLOPT_POSTQUOTE(3) work for SFTP, this option does not.

DEFAULT
       NULL

PROTOCOLS
       FTP

EXAMPLE
       struct curl_slist *cmdlist = NULL;
       cmdlist = curl_slist_append(cmdlist, "SYST");

       curl = curl_easy_init();
       if(curl) {
         curl_easy_setopt(curl, CURLOPT_URL, "ftp://example.com/foo.bin");

         /* pass in the FTP commands to run */
         curl_easy_setopt(curl, CURLOPT_PREQUOTE, cmdlist);

         ret = curl_easy_perform(curl);

         curl_easy_cleanup(curl);
       }

AVAILABILITY
       Along with the protocol support

RETURN VALUE
       Returns CURLE_OK if the option is supported, and CURLE_UNKNOWN_OPTION if not.
