NAME
       ares_parse_txt_reply - Parse a reply to a DNS query of type TXT

SYNOPSIS
       #include <ares.h>

       int ares_parse_txt_reply(const unsigned char* abuf, int alen,
                                struct ares_txt_reply **txt_out);

       int ares_parse_txt_reply_ext(const unsigned char* abuf, int alen,
                                    struct ares_txt_ext **txt_out);

DESCRIPTION
       The  ares_parse_txt_reply  (ares_parse_txt_reply_ext)  function  parses  the  response  to  a  query  of  type TXT into a linked list (one element per sub-string) of struct ares_txt_reply (struct
       ares_txt_ext) The parameters abuf and alen give the contents of the response.  The result is stored in allocated memory and a pointer to it stored into the variable pointed to by txt_out.  It  is
       the caller's responsibility to free the resulting txt_out structure when it is no longer needed using the function ares_free_data

       The structure ares_txt_reply contains the following fields:

           struct ares_txt_reply {
             struct ares_txt_reply  *next;
             unsigned int  length;
             unsigned char *txt;
           };

       The structure ares_txt_ext contains the following fields:

           struct ares_txt_ext {
             struct ares_txt_ext  *next;
             unsigned int  length;
             unsigned char *txt;
             unsigned char record_start;
           };

       The  record_start  field  in  struct  ares_txt_ext  is 1 if this structure is a start of a TXT record, and 0 if the structure is a continuation of a previous record. The linked list of the struct
       ares_txt_ext will have at least one item with record_start equal to 1, and may have some items with record_start equal to 0 between them.

       These sequences of struct ares_txt_ext (starting from the item with record_start equal to 1, and ending right before the record start item) may be treated as either components  of  a  single  TXT
       record or as a multi-parted TXT record, depending on particular use case.

RETURN VALUES
       ares_parse_txt_reply (ares_parse_txt_reply_ext) can return any of the following values:

       ARES_SUCCESS   The response was successfully parsed.

       ARES_EBADRESP  The response was malformatted.

       ARES_ENODATA   The response did not contain an answer to the query.

       ARES_ENOMEM    Memory was exhausted.

AVAILABILITY
       This function was first introduced in c-ares version 1.7.0.
