NAME
       XvGrabPort - lock port for exclusive use by client

SYNOPSIS
       #include <X11/extensions/Xvlib.h>

       int XvGrabPort(Display *dpy, XvPortID port, Time time);

ARGUMENTS
       dpy     Specifies the connection to the X server.

       port    Defines the port to be grabbed.

       time    Specifies the request timestamp.

DESCRIPTION
       XvGrabPort(3) grabs a port.  Once a client grabs a port, only that client can make video requests to that port.

       If the time is before the current port time, the XvGrabPort request is ignored and XvInvalidTime is returned.  If the port is already grabbed by another client, XvAlreadyGrabbed is returned. Oth‐
       erwise it returns a status of Success.  The port time is updated when the following requests are processed: XvGrabPort(3), XvUngrabPort(3),  XvPutVideo(3),  XvPutStill(3),  XvGetVideo(3),  XvGet‐
       Still(3).

       If the port is actively processing video for another client, the video is preempted, and an XvVideoNotify event with detail XvPreempted is generated for its drawable.

RETURN VALUES
       [Success]
               Returned if XvGrabPort(3) completed successfully.

       [XvInvalidTime]
               Returned if requested time is older than the current port time.

       [XvAlreadyGrabbed]
               Returned if the port is already grabbed by another client.

       [XvBadExtension]
               Returned if the Xv extension is unavailable.

       [XvBadAlloc]
               Returned if XvGrabPort(3) failed to allocate memory to process the request.

DIAGNOSTICS
       [XvBadPort]    Generated if the requested port does not exist.
