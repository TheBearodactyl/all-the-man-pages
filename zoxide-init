NAME
       zoxide-init - generate shell configuration for zoxide

SYNOPSIS
       zoxide init SHELL [OPTIONS]

DESCRIPTION
       To initialize zoxide on your shell:

       bash   Add this to your configuration (usually ~/.bashrc):

                  eval "$(zoxide init bash)"

       elvish Add this to your configuration (usually ~/.elvish/rc.elv):

                  eval $(zoxide init elvish | slurp)

              Note: zoxide only supports elvish v0.18.0 and above.

       fish   Add this to your configuration (usually ~/.config/fish/config.fish):

                  zoxide init fish | source

              Note: zoxide only supports fish v3.4.0 and above.

       nushell
              Add this to your env file (find it by running $nu.env-path in Nushell):

                  zoxide init nushell | save -f ~/.zoxide.nu

              Now, add this to the end of your config file (find it by running $nu.config-path in Nushell):

                  source ~/.zoxide.nu

              Note: zoxide only supports Nushell v0.73.0 and above.

       powershell
              Add this to your configuration (find it by running echo $profile in PowerShell):

                  Invoke-Expression (& {
                      $hook = if ($PSVersionTable.PSVersion.Major -lt 6) { 'prompt' } else { 'pwd' }
                      (zoxide init --hook $hook powershell | Out-String)
                  })

       xonsh  Add this to your configuration (usually ~/.xonshrc):

                  execx($(zoxide init xonsh), 'exec', __xonsh__.ctx, filename='zoxide')

       zsh    Add this to your configuration (usually ~/.zshrc):

                  eval "$(zoxide init zsh)"

       any POSIX shell

              Add this to your configuration:

                  eval "$(zoxide init posix --hook prompt)"

OPTIONS
       --cmd  Changes the prefix of the z and zi commands.
              --cmd j would change the commands to (j, ji).
              --cmd cd would replace the cd command (doesn't work on Nushell / POSIX shells).

       -h, --help
              Print help information.

       --hook HOOK
              Changes how often zoxide increments a directory's score:

                  none     Never
                  prompt   At every shell prompt
                  pwd      Whenever the directory is changed

       --no-cmd
              Prevents zoxide from defining the z and zi commands. These functions will still be available in your shell as __zoxide_z and __zoxide_zi, should you choose to redefine them.
