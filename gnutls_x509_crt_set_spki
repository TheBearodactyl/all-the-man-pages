NAME
       gnutls_x509_crt_set_spki - API function

SYNOPSIS
       #include <gnutls/x509.h>

       int gnutls_x509_crt_set_spki(gnutls_x509_crt_t crt, const gnutls_x509_spki_t spki, unsigned int flags);

ARGUMENTS
       gnutls_x509_crt_t crt
                   a certificate of type gnutls_x509_crt_t

       const gnutls_x509_spki_t spki
                   a SubjectPublicKeyInfo structure of type gnutls_x509_spki_t

       unsigned int flags
                   must be zero

DESCRIPTION
       This  function will set the certificate's subject public key information explicitly. This is intended to be used in the cases where a single public key (e.g., RSA) can be used for multiple signa‐
       ture algorithms (RSA PKCS1-1.5, and RSA-PSS).

       To export the public key (i.e., the SubjectPublicKeyInfo part), check gnutls_pubkey_import_x509().

RETURNS
       On success, GNUTLS_E_SUCCESS (0) is returned, otherwise a negative error value.

SINCE
       3.6.0
