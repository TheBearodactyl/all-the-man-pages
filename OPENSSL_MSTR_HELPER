OPENSSL_FILE(3ssl)                  OpenSSL                 OPENSSL_FILE(3ssl)

NAME
       OPENSSL_FILE, OPENSSL_LINE, OPENSSL_FUNC, OPENSSL_MSTR,
       OPENSSL_MSTR_HELPER - generic C programming utility macros

SYNOPSIS
        #include <openssl/macros.h>

        #define OPENSSL_FILE /* typically: __FILE__ */
        #define OPENSSL_LINE /* typically: __LINE__ */
        #define OPENSSL_FUNC /* typically: __func__ */

        #define OPENSSL_MSTR_HELPER(x) #x
        #define OPENSSL_MSTR(x) OPENSSL_MSTR_HELPER(x)

DESCRIPTION
       The macros OPENSSL_FILE and OPENSSL_LINE typically yield the current
       filename and line number during C compilation.  When
       OPENSSL_NO_FILENAMES is defined they yield "" and 0, respectively.

       The macro OPENSSL_FUNC attempts to yield the name of the C function
       currently being compiled, as far as language and compiler versions
       allow.  Otherwise, it yields "(unknown function)".

       The macro OPENSSL_MSTR yields the expansion of the macro given as
       argument, which is useful for concatenation with string constants.  The
       macro OPENSSL_MSTR_HELPER is an auxiliary macro for this purpose.

RETURN VALUES
       see above
