NAME
       XkbSetControls - Copies changes to the X server based on a modified ctrls structure in a local copy of the keyboard description

SYNOPSIS
       Bool XkbSetControls (Display *display, unsigned long which, XkbDescPtr xkb);

ARGUMENTS
       display
              connection to X server

       which  mask of controls requested

       xkb    keyboard description for controls information

DESCRIPTION
       For  each  bit  that  is set in the which parameter, XkbSetControls sends the corresponding values from the xkb->ctrls field to the server. Valid values for which are any combination of the masks
       listed in Table 1 that have "ok" in the which column.

       Table 1 shows the actual values for the individual mask bits used to select controls for modification and to enable and disable the control. Note that the same mask bit is used to specify general
       modifications  to the parameters used to configure the control (which), and to enable and disable the control (enabled_ctrls). The anomalies in the table (no "ok" in column) are for controls that
       have no configurable attributes; and for controls that are not boolean controls and therefore cannot be enabled or disabled.

       If xkb->ctrls is NULL, the server does not support a compatible version of Xkb, or the Xkb extension has not been properly initialized, XkbSetControls returns False. Otherwise, it sends  the  re‐
       quest to the X server and returns True.

       Note  that changes to attributes of controls in the XkbControlsRec structure are apparent only when the associated control is enabled, although the corresponding values are still updated in the X
       server. For example, the repeat_delay and repeat_interval fields are ignored unless the RepeatKeys control is enabled (that is, the X server's equivalent of xkb->ctrls has XkbRepeatKeyMask set in
       enabled_ctrls).   It is permissible to modify the attributes of a control in one call to XkbSetControls and enable the control in a subsequent call. See XkbChangeEnabledControls for more informa‐
       tion on enabling and disabling controls.

       Note that the enabled_ctrls field is itself a control - the EnabledControls control. As such, to set a specific configuration of enabled and disabled boolean controls, you must set  enabled_ctrls
       to the appropriate bits to enable only the controls you want and disable all others, then specify the XkbControlsEnabledMask in a call to XkbSetControls.

       Because  this  is  somewhat  awkward  if  all  you want to do is enable and disable controls, and not modify any of their attributes, a convenience function is also provided for this purpose, Xk‐
       bChangeEnabledControls.

RETURN VALUES
       True           The XkbSetControls function returns True when it sends the request to the X server.

       False          The XkbSetControls function returns False when xkb->ctrls is NULL, the server does not support a compatible version of Xkb, or the Xkb extension has not been properly initialized.

DIAGNOSTICS
       BadAlloc       Unable to allocate storage

       BadMatch       A compatible version of Xkb was not available in the server or an argument has correct type and range, but is otherwise invalid
