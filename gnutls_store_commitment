NAME
       gnutls_store_commitment - API function

SYNOPSIS
       #include <gnutls/gnutls.h>

       int  gnutls_store_commitment(const  char * db_name, gnutls_tdb_t tdb, const char * host, const char * service, gnutls_digest_algorithm_t hash_algo, const gnutls_datum_t * hash, time_t expiration,
       unsigned int flags);

ARGUMENTS
       const char * db_name
                   A file specifying the stored keys (use NULL for the default)

       gnutls_tdb_t tdb
                   A storage structure or NULL to use the default

       const char * host
                   The peer's name

       const char * service
                   non-NULL if this key is specific to a service (e.g. http)

       gnutls_digest_algorithm_t hash_algo
                   The hash algorithm type

       const gnutls_datum_t * hash
                   The raw hash

       time_t expiration
                   The expiration time (use 0 to disable expiration)

       unsigned int flags
                   should be 0 or GNUTLS_SCOMMIT_FLAG_ALLOW_BROKEN.

DESCRIPTION
       This function will store the provided hash commitment to the list of stored public keys. The key with the given hash will be considered valid until the provided expiration time.

       The  tdb variable if non-null specifies a custom backend for the storage of entries. If it is NULL then the default file backend will be used.

       Note that this function is not thread safe with the default backend.

RETURNS
       On success, GNUTLS_E_SUCCESS (0) is returned, otherwise a negative error value.

SINCE
       3.0
