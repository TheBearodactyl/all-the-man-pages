NAME
       gnutls_pk_bits_to_sec_param - API function

SYNOPSIS
       #include <gnutls/gnutls.h>

       gnutls_sec_param_t gnutls_pk_bits_to_sec_param(gnutls_pk_algorithm_t algo, unsigned int bits);

ARGUMENTS
       gnutls_pk_algorithm_t algo
                   is a public key algorithm

       unsigned int bits
                   is the number of bits

DESCRIPTION
       This is the inverse of gnutls_sec_param_to_pk_bits(). Given an algorithm and the number of bits, it will return the security parameter. This is a rough indication.

RETURNS
       The security parameter.

SINCE
       2.12.0
