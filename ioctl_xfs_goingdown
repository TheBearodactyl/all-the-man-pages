NAME
       ioctl_xfs_goingdown - shut down an XFS filesystem

SYNOPSIS
       #include <xfs/xfs_fs.h>

       int ioctl(int fd, XFS_IOC_GOINGDOWN, uint32_t flags);

DESCRIPTION
       Shuts down a live XFS filesystem.  This is a software initiated hard shutdown and should be avoided whenever possible.  After this call completes, the filesystem ill be totally unusable until the
       filesystem has been unmounted and remounted.

       flags can be one of the following:

           XFS_FSOP_GOING_FLAGS_DEFAULT
                  Flush all dirty data and metadata to disk, flush pending transactions to the log, and shut down.

           XFS_FSOP_GOING_FLAGS_LOGFLUSH
                  Flush all pending metadata transactions to the log and shut down, leaving all dirty data unwritten.

           XFS_FSOP_GOING_FLAGS_NOLOGFLUSH
                  Shut down immediately, without writing pending transactions or dirty data to disk.

RETURN VALUE
       On error, -1 is returned, and errno is set to indicate the error.

ERRORS
       Error codes can be one of, but are not limited to, the following:

       EFSBADCRC
              Metadata checksum validation failed while performing the query.

       EFSCORRUPTED
