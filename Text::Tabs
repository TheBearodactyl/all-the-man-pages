Text::Tabs(3perl)                                                                    Perl Programmers Reference Guide                                                                    Text::Tabs(3perl)

NAME
       Text::Tabs - expand and unexpand tabs like unix expand(1) and unexpand(1)

SYNOPSIS
         use Text::Tabs;

         $tabstop = 4;  # default = 8
         @lines_without_tabs = expand(@lines_with_tabs);
         @lines_with_tabs = unexpand(@lines_without_tabs);

DESCRIPTION
       Text::Tabs does most of what the unix utilities expand(1) and unexpand(1) do.  Given a line with tabs in it, "expand" replaces those tabs with the appropriate number of spaces.  Given a line with
       or without tabs in it, "unexpand" adds tabs when it can save bytes by doing so, like the "unexpand -a" command.

       Unlike the old unix utilities, this module correctly accounts for any Unicode combining characters (such as diacriticals) that may occur in each line for both expansion and unexpansion.  These
       are overstrike characters that do not increment the logical position.  Make sure you have the appropriate Unicode settings enabled.

EXPORTS
       The following are exported:

       expand
       unexpand
       $tabstop
           The $tabstop variable controls how many column positions apart each tabstop is.  The default is 8.

           Please note that "local($tabstop)" doesn't do the right thing and if you want to use "local" to override $tabstop, you need to use "local($Text::Tabs::tabstop)".

EXAMPLE
         #!perl
         # unexpand -a
         use Text::Tabs;

         while (<>) {
           print unexpand $_;
         }

       Instead of the shell's "expand" command, use:

         perl -MText::Tabs -n -e 'print expand $_'

       Instead of the shell's "unexpand -a" command, use:

         perl -MText::Tabs -n -e 'print unexpand $_'

BUGS
       Text::Tabs handles only tabs ("\t") and combining characters ("/\pM/").  It doesn't count backwards for backspaces ("\t"), omit other non-printing control characters ("/\pC/"), or otherwise deal
       with any other zero-, half-, and full-width characters.
