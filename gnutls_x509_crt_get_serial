NAME
       gnutls_x509_crt_get_serial - API function

SYNOPSIS
       #include <gnutls/x509.h>

       int gnutls_x509_crt_get_serial(gnutls_x509_crt_t cert, void * result, size_t * result_size);

ARGUMENTS
       gnutls_x509_crt_t cert
                   should contain a gnutls_x509_crt_t type

       void * result
                   The place where the serial number will be copied

       size_t * result_size
                   Holds the size of the result field.

DESCRIPTION
       This function will return the X.509 certificate's serial number.  This is obtained by the X509 Certificate serialNumber field. Serial is not always a 32 or 64bit number. Some CAs use large serial
       numbers, thus it may be wise to handle it as something uint8_t.

RETURNS
       On success, GNUTLS_E_SUCCESS (0) is returned, otherwise a negative error value.
