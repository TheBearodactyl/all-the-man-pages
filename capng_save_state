NAME
       capng_save_state - get the internal library state

SYNOPSIS
       #include <cap-ng.h>

       void *capng_save_state(void);

DESCRIPTION
       capng_save_state  is a function that returns a pointer to the internal state of the libcap-ng library. It should be considered opaque and not for alteration directly. This function should be used
       when you suspect a third party library may use libcap-ng also and want to make sure it doesn't alter something important. This function is not available in the python bindings.

RETURN VALUE
       This returns NULL on failure and a non-NULL pointer otherwise.

NOTES
       The structure returned by capng_save_state is malloc'd;  it should be free'd if not used.
