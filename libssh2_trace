       void libssh2_trace(LIBSSH2_SESSION *session, int bitmask);

DESCRIPTION
       This  is  a function present in the library that can be used to get debug info from within libssh2 when it is running. Helpful when trying to trace or debug behaviors. Note that this function has
       no effect unless libssh2 was built to support tracing! It is usually disabled in release builds.
