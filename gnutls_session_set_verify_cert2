NAME
       gnutls_session_set_verify_cert2 - API function

SYNOPSIS
       #include <gnutls/gnutls.h>

       void gnutls_session_set_verify_cert2(gnutls_session_t session, gnutls_typed_vdata_st * data, unsigned elements, unsigned flags);

ARGUMENTS
       gnutls_session_t session
                   is a gnutls session

       gnutls_typed_vdata_st * data
                   an array of typed data

       unsigned elements
                   the number of data elements

       unsigned flags
                   flags for certificate verification -- gnutls_certificate_verify_flags

DESCRIPTION
       This function instructs GnuTLS to verify the peer's certificate using the provided typed data information. If the verification fails the handshake will also fail with GNUTLS_E_CERTIFICATE_VERIFI‐
       CATION_ERROR. In that case the verification result can be obtained using gnutls_session_get_verify_cert_status().

       The acceptable typed data are the same as in gnutls_certificate_verify_peers(), and once set must remain valid for the lifetime of the session. More precisely they should be available during  any
       subsequent handshakes.

       If  flags is provided which contain a profile, this function should be called after any session priority setting functions.

SINCE
       3.4.6
