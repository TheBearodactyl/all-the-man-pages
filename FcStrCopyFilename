NAME
       FcStrCopyFilename - create a complete path from a filename

SYNOPSIS
       #include <fontconfig/fontconfig.h>

       FcChar8 * FcStrCopyFilename (const FcChar8 *s);

DESCRIPTION
       FcStrCopyFilename constructs an absolute pathname from s. It converts any leading '~' characters in to the value of the HOME environment variable, and any relative paths are converted to absolute
       paths using the current working directory. Sequences of '/' characters are converted to a single '/', and names containing the current directory '.' or parent directory '..' are correctly  recon‚Äê
       structed.  Returns NULL if '~' is the leading character and HOME is unset or disabled (see FcConfigEnableHome).
