NAME
     mkd_callbacks — functions that modify link targets

LIBRARY
     Markdown (libmarkdown, -lmarkdown)

SYNOPSIS
     #include <mkdio.h>

     char*
     (*mkd_callback_t)(const char*, const int, void*);

     void
     (*mkd_free_t)(char *, void*);

     void
     mkd_e_url(MMIOT *document, mkd_callback_t edit);

     void
     mkd_e_flags(MMIOT *document, mkd_callback_t edit);

     void
     mkd_e_free(MMIOT *document, mkd_free_t dealloc);

     void
     mkd_e_data(MMIOT *document, void *data);

DESCRIPTION
     Discount provides a small set of data access functions to let a library user modify the targets given in a `[]' link, and to add additional flags to the generated link.

     The data access functions are passed a character pointer to the url being generated, the size of the url, and a data pointer pointing to a user data area (set by the mkd_e_data() function.)     Af‐
     ter the callback function is called (either mkd_e_url() or mkd_e_flags()) the data freeing function (if supplied) is called and passed the character pointer and user data pointer.

EXAMPLE
     The mkd_basename() function (in the module basename.c) is implemented by means of mkd callbacks;  it modifies urls that start with a `/' so that they begin with a user-supplied url base by allocat‐
     ing a new string and filling it with the base + the url.  Discount plugs that url in in place of the original, then calls the basename free function (it only does this when mkd_e_url() or
     mkd_e_flags() returns nonzero) to deallocate this memory.

     Note that only one level of callbacks are supported; if you wish to do multiple callbacks, you need to write your own code to handle them all.

BUGS
     Error handling is minimal at best.
