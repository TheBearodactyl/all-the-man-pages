SD_BUS_CAN_SEND(3)              sd_bus_can_send             SD_BUS_CAN_SEND(3)

NAME
       sd_bus_can_send - Check which types can be sent over a bus object

SYNOPSIS
       #include <systemd/sd-bus.h>

       void sd_bus_can_send(sd_bus *bus, char type);

DESCRIPTION
       sd_bus_can_send() is mostly used for checking if file descriptor
       passing is available on the given bus.  type can be any of the
       SD_BUS_TYPE constants.

RETURN VALUE
       On failure, sd_bus_can_send() returns a negative errno-style error
       code. If values of the given type can be sent over the given bus, it
       returns a positive integer. Otherwise, it returns zero.

   Errors
       Returned errors may indicate the following problems:

       -ENOPKG
           The bus object bus could not be resolved.

       -ENOTCONN
           The input parameter bus is NULL or the bus is not connected.

       -ECHILD
           The bus object bus was created in a different process.

NOTES
       These APIs are implemented as a shared library, which can be compiled
       and linked to with the libsystemd pkg-config(1) file.
