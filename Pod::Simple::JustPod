Pod::Simple::JustPod(3pPerl Programmers Reference GPod::Simple::JustPod(3perl)

NAME
       Pod::Simple::JustPod -- just the Pod, the whole Pod, and nothing but
       the Pod

SYNOPSIS
        my $infile  = "mixed_code_and_pod.pm";
        my $outfile = "just_the_pod.pod";
        open my $fh, ">$outfile" or die "Can't write to $outfile: $!";

        my $parser = Pod::Simple::JustPod->new();
        $parser->output_fh($fh);
        $parser->parse_file($infile);
        close $fh or die "Can't close $outfile: $!";

DESCRIPTION
       This class returns a copy of its input, translated into Perl's internal
       encoding (UTF-8), and with all the non-Pod lines removed.

       This is a subclass of Pod::Simple::Methody and inherits all its
       methods.  And since, that in turn is a subclass of Pod::Simple, you can
       use any of its methods.  This means you can output to a string instead
       of a file, or you can parse from an array.

       This class strives to return the Pod lines of the input completely
       unchanged, except for any necessary translation into Perl's internal
       encoding, and it makes no effort to return trailing spaces on lines;
       these likely will be stripped.  If the input pod is well-formed with no
       warnings nor errors generated, the extracted pod should generate the
       same documentation when formatted by a Pod formatter as the original
       file does.

       By default, warnings are output to STDERR
