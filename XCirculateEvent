NAME
       XCirculateEvent - CirculateNotify event structure

STRUCTURES
       The structure for CirculateNotify events contains:

       typedef struct {
               int type;       /* CirculateNotify */
               unsigned long serial;   /* # of last request processed by server */
               Bool send_event;        /* true if this came from a SendEvent request */
               Display *display;       /* Display the event was read from */
               Window event;
               Window window;
               int place;      /* PlaceOnTop, PlaceOnBottom */
       } XCirculateEvent;

       When you receive this event, the structure members are set as follows.

       The  type  member is set to the event type constant name that uniquely identifies it.  For example, when the X server reports a GraphicsExpose event to a client application, it sends an XGraphic‐
       sExposeEvent structure with the type member set to GraphicsExpose.  The display member is set to a pointer to the display the event was read on.  The send_event member is set to True if the event
       came  from a SendEvent protocol request.  The serial member is set from the serial number reported in the protocol but expanded from the 16-bit least-significant bits to a full 32-bit value.  The
       window member is set to the window that is most useful to toolkit dispatchers.

       The event member is set either to the restacked window or to its parent, depending on whether StructureNotify or SubstructureNotify was selected.  The window member is set to the window that  was
       restacked.   The  place  member is set to the window's position after the restack occurs and is either PlaceOnTop or PlaceOnBottom.  If it is PlaceOnTop, the window is now on top of all siblings.
       If it is PlaceOnBottom, the window is now below all siblings.
