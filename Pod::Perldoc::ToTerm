Pod::Perldoc::ToTerm(3pPerl Programmers Reference GPod::Perldoc::ToTerm(3perl)

NAME
       Pod::Perldoc::ToTerm - render Pod with terminal escapes

SYNOPSIS
         perldoc -o term Some::Modulename

DESCRIPTION
       This is a "plug-in" class that allows Perldoc to use Pod::Text as a
       formatter class.

       It supports the following options, which are explained in Pod::Text:
       alt, indent, loose, quotes, sentence, width

       For example:

         perldoc -o term -w indent:5 Some::Modulename

PAGER FORMATTING
       Depending on the platform, and because this class emits terminal
       escapes it will attempt to set the "-R" flag on your pager by injecting
       the flag into your environment variable for "less" or "more".

       On Windows and DOS, this class will not modify any environment
       variables.

CAVEAT
       This module may change to use a different text formatter class in the
       future, and this may change what options are supported.
