NAME
       gnutls_hmac_init - API function

SYNOPSIS
       #include <gnutls/crypto.h>

       int gnutls_hmac_init(gnutls_hmac_hd_t * dig, gnutls_mac_algorithm_t algorithm, const void * key, size_t keylen);

ARGUMENTS
       gnutls_hmac_hd_t * dig
                   is a gnutls_hmac_hd_t type

       gnutls_mac_algorithm_t algorithm
                   the HMAC algorithm to use

       const void * key
                   the key to be used for encryption

       size_t keylen
                   the length of the key

DESCRIPTION
       This  function  will  initialize  an context that can be used to produce a Message Authentication Code (MAC) of data.  This will effectively use the current crypto backend in use by gnutls or the
       cryptographic accelerator in use.

       Note that despite the name of this function, it can be used for other MAC algorithms than HMAC.

RETURNS
       Zero or a negative error code on error.

SINCE
       2.10.0
