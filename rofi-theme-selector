NAME
       rofi-theme-selector - Preview and apply themes for rofi

DESCRIPTION
       rofi-theme-selector  is  a bash/rofi script to preview and apply themes
       for rofi.  It's part of any installation of rofi.

USAGE
   Running rofi-theme-selector
       rofi-theme-selector shows a list of all available themes in a rofi win‐
       dow.   It  lets you preview each theme with the Enter key and apply the
       theme to your rofi configuration file with Alt+a.

Theme directories
       rofi-theme-selector searches the following directories for themes:

              • ${PREFIX}/share/rofi/themes

              • $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/rofi/themes

              • $XDG_DATA_HOME/share/rofi/themes

       ${PREFIX} reflects the install location of rofi.  In  most  cases  this
       will  be  "/usr".   $XDG_CONFIG_HOME is normally unset. Default path is
       "$HOME/.config".  $XDG_DATA_HOME is normally  unset.  Default  path  is
       "$HOME/.local/share".
