NAME
       uuid - DCE compatible Universally Unique Identifier library

SYNOPSIS
       #include <uuid.h>

DESCRIPTION
       The UUID library is used to generate unique identifiers for objects that may be accessible beyond the local system. This library generates UUIDs compatible with those created by the Open Software
       Foundation (OSF) Distributed Computing Environment (DCE) utility uuidgen(1).

       The UUIDs generated by this library can be reasonably expected to be unique within a system, and unique across all systems. They could be used, for instance, to generate unique HTTP cookies
       across multiple web servers without communication between the servers, and without fear of a name clash.

CONFORMING TO
       This library generates UUIDs compatible with OSF DCE 1.1, and hash based UUIDs V3 and V5 compatible with RFC-4122 <https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4122>.
