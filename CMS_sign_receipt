NAME
       CMS_sign_receipt - create a CMS signed receipt

SYNOPSIS
        #include <openssl/cms.h>

        CMS_ContentInfo *CMS_sign_receipt(CMS_SignerInfo *si, X509 *signcert,
                                          EVP_PKEY *pkey, STACK_OF(X509) *certs,
                                          unsigned int flags);

DESCRIPTION
       CMS_sign_receipt() creates and returns a CMS signed receipt structure. si is the CMS_SignerInfo structure containing the signed receipt request.  signcert is the certificate to sign with, pkey is
       the corresponding private key.  certs is an optional additional set of certificates to include in the CMS structure (for example any intermediate CAs in the chain).

       flags is an optional set of flags.

NOTES
       This functions behaves in a similar way to CMS_sign() except the flag values CMS_DETACHED, CMS_BINARY, CMS_NOATTR, CMS_TEXT and CMS_STREAM are not supported since they do not make sense in the
       context of signed receipts.

RETURN VALUES
       CMS_sign_receipt() returns either a valid CMS_ContentInfo structure or NULL if an error occurred.  The error can be obtained from ERR_get_error(3).
