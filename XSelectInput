NAME
       XSelectInput - select input events

SYNTAX
       int XSelectInput(Display *display, Window w, long event_mask);

ARGUMENTS
       display   Specifies the connection to the X server.

       event_mask
                 Specifies the event mask.

       w         Specifies the window whose events you are interested in.

DESCRIPTION
       The  XSelectInput  function requests that the X server report the events associated with the specified event mask.  Initially, X will not report any of these events.  Events are reported relative
       to a window.  If a window is not interested in a device event, it usually propagates to the closest ancestor that is interested, unless the do_not_propagate mask prohibits it.

       Setting the event-mask attribute of a window overrides any previous call for the same window but not for other clients.  Multiple clients can select for the same events on the  same  window  with
       the following restrictions:

       •    Multiple clients can select events on the same window because their event masks are disjoint.  When the X server generates an event, it reports it to all interested clients.

       •    Only one client at a time can select CirculateRequest, ConfigureRequest, or MapRequest events, which are associated with the event mask SubstructureRedirectMask.

       •    Only one client at a time can select a ResizeRequest event, which is associated with the event mask ResizeRedirectMask.

       •    Only one client at a time can select a ButtonPress event, which is associated with the event mask ButtonPressMask.

       The server reports the event to all interested clients.

       XSelectInput can generate a BadWindow error.

DIAGNOSTICS
       BadWindow A value for a Window argument does not name a defined Window.
