NAME
       glob - Return names of files that match patterns

SYNOPSIS
       glob ?switches? ?pattern ...?
__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

DESCRIPTION
       This command performs file name “globbing” in a fashion similar to the csh shell or bash shell.  It returns a list of the files whose names match any of the pattern arguments. No particular order
       is guaranteed in the list, so if a sorted list is required the caller should use lsort.

   OPTIONS
       If the initial arguments to glob start with - then they are treated as switches. The following switches are currently supported:

       -directory directory
              Search for files which match the given patterns starting in the given directory. This allows searching of directories whose name contains glob-sensitive  characters  without  the  need  to
              quote  such  characters  explicitly.  This option may not be used in conjunction with -path, which is used to allow searching for complete file paths whose names may contain glob-sensitive
              characters.

       -join  The remaining pattern arguments, after option processing, are treated as a single pattern obtained by joining the arguments with directory separators.

       -nocomplain
              Allows an empty list to be returned without error; without this switch an error is returned if the result list would be empty.

       -path pathPrefix
              Search for files with the given pathPrefix where the rest of the name matches the given patterns. This allows searching for files with names similar to a given file (as opposed to a direc‐
              tory)  even  when  the names contain glob-sensitive characters. This option may not be used in conjunction with -directory. For example, to find all files with the same root name as $path,
              but differing extensions, you should use “glob -path [file rootname $path] .*”  which will work even if $path contains numerous glob-sensitive characters.

       -tails Only return the part of each file found which follows the last directory named in any -directory or -path path specification.  Thus “glob -tails -directory $dir *” is  equivalent  to  “set
              pwd  [pwd];  cd  $dir;  glob *; cd $pwd”.  For -path specifications, the returned names will include the last path segment, so “glob -tails -path [file rootname ~/foo.tex] .*”  will return
              paths like foo.aux foo.bib foo.tex etc.

       -types typeList
              Only list files or directories which match typeList, where the items in the list have two forms. The first form is like the -type option of the Unix find command: b (block special file), c
              (character  special  file),  d (directory), f (plain file), l (symbolic link), p (named pipe), or s (socket), where multiple types may be specified in the list.  Glob will return all files
              which match at least one of the types given.  Note that symbolic links will be returned both if -types l is given, or if the target of a link matches the requested type. So, a  link  to  a
              directory will be returned if -types d was specified.

              The  second  form  specifies  types  where all the types given must match.  These are r, w, x as file permissions, and readonly, hidden as special permission cases. On the Macintosh, MacOS
              types and creators are also supported, where any item which is four characters long is assumed to be a MacOS type (e.g. TEXT). Items which are of the form {macintosh type XXXX} or  {macin‐
              tosh creator XXXX} will match types or creators respectively. Unrecognized types, or specifications of multiple MacOS types/creators will signal an error.

              The two forms may be mixed, so -types {d f r w} will find all regular files OR directories that have both read AND write permissions.  The following are equivalent:

                     glob -type d *
                     glob */

              except that the first case doesn't return the trailing “/” and is more platform independent.

       --     Marks the end of switches. The argument following this one will be treated as a pattern even if it starts with a -.

   GLOBBING PATTERNS
       The pattern arguments may contain any of the following special characters, which are a superset of those supported by string match:

       ?         Matches any single character.

       *         Matches any sequence of zero or more characters.

       [chars]   Matches any single character in chars. If chars contains a sequence of the form a-b then any character between a and b (inclusive) will match.

       \x        Matches the character x.

       {a,b,...} Matches any of the sub-patterns a, b, etc.

       On  Unix,  as with csh, a “.” at the beginning of a file's name or just after a “/” must be matched explicitly or with a {} construct, unless the -types hidden flag is given (since “.” at the be‐
       ginning of a file's name indicates that it is hidden). On other platforms, files beginning with a “.” are handled no differently to any others, except the special directories “.” and  “..”  which
       must  be  matched  explicitly  (this  is to avoid a recursive pattern like “glob -join * * * *” from recursing up the directory hierarchy as well as down). In addition, all “/” characters must be
       matched explicitly.

       If the first character in a pattern is “~” then it refers to the home directory for the user whose name follows the “~”.  If the “~” is followed immediately by “/” then the value of the HOME  en‐
       vironment variable is used.

       The glob command differs from csh globbing in two ways.  First, it does not sort its result list (use the lsort command if you want the list sorted).  Second, glob only returns the names of files
       that actually exist; in csh no check for existence is made unless a pattern contains a ?, *, or [] construct.

       When the glob command returns relative paths whose filenames start with a tilde “~” (for example through glob * or glob -tails, the returned list will not quote the tilde with “./”.   This  means
       care must be taken if those names are later to be used with file join, to avoid them being interpreted as absolute paths pointing to a given user's home directory.

WINDOWS PORTABILITY ISSUES
       For  Windows  UNC  names, the servername and sharename components of the path may not contain ?, *, or [] constructs. On Windows NT, if pattern is of the form “~username@domain”, it refers to the
       home directory of the user whose account information resides on the specified NT domain server. Otherwise, user account information is obtained from the local computer.

       Since the backslash character has a special meaning to the glob command, glob patterns containing Windows style path separators need special care.  The  pattern  “C:\\foo\\*”  is  interpreted  as
       “C:\foo\*”  where “\f” will match the single character “f” and “\*” will match the single character “*” and will not be interpreted as a wildcard character. One solution to this problem is to use
       the Unix style forward slash as a path separator. Windows style paths can be converted to Unix style paths with the command “file join $path” or “file normalize $path”.

EXAMPLES
       Find all the Tcl files in the current directory:

              glob *.tcl

       Find all the Tcl files in the user's home directory, irrespective of what the current directory is:

              glob -directory ~ *.tcl

       Find all subdirectories of the current directory:

              glob -type d *

       Find all files whose name contains an “a”, a “b” or the sequence “cde”:

              glob -type f *{a,b,cde}*

NAME
       glob, globfree - find pathnames matching a pattern, free memory from glob()

LIBRARY
       Standard C library (libc, -lc)

SYNOPSIS
       #include <glob.h>

       int glob(const char *restrict pattern, int flags,
                int (*errfunc)(const char *epath, int eerrno),
                glob_t *restrict pglob);
       void globfree(glob_t *pglob);

DESCRIPTION
       The  glob()  function  searches  for  all the pathnames matching pattern according to the rules used by the shell (see glob(7)).  No tilde expansion or parameter substitution is done; if you want
       these, use wordexp(3).

       The globfree() function frees the dynamically allocated storage from an earlier call to glob().

       The results of a glob() call are stored in the structure pointed to by pglob.  This structure is of type glob_t (declared in <glob.h>) and includes the following elements defined by POSIX.2 (more
       may be present as an extension):

           typedef struct {
               size_t   gl_pathc;    /* Count of paths matched so far  */
               char   **gl_pathv;    /* List of matched pathnames.  */
               size_t   gl_offs;     /* Slots to reserve in gl_pathv.  */
           } glob_t;

       Results are stored in dynamically allocated storage.

       The argument flags is made up of the bitwise OR of zero or more the following symbolic constants, which modify the behavior of glob():

       GLOB_ERR
              Return upon a read error (because a directory does not have read permission, for example).  By default, glob() attempts carry on despite errors, reading all of the directories that it can.

       GLOB_MARK
              Append a slash to each path which corresponds to a directory.

       GLOB_NOSORT
              Don't sort the returned pathnames.  The only reason to do this is to save processing time.  By default, the returned pathnames are sorted.

       GLOB_DOOFFS
              Reserve pglob->gl_offs slots at the beginning of the list of strings in pglob->pathv.  The reserved slots contain null pointers.

       GLOB_NOCHECK
              If no pattern matches, return the original pattern.  By default, glob() returns GLOB_NOMATCH if there are no matches.

       GLOB_APPEND
              Append the results of this call to the vector of results returned by a previous call to glob().  Do not set this flag on the first invocation of glob().

       GLOB_NOESCAPE
              Don't  allow  backslash  ('\') to be used as an escape character.  Normally, a backslash can be used to quote the following character, providing a mechanism to turn off the special meaning
              metacharacters.

       flags may also include any of the following, which are GNU extensions and not defined by POSIX.2:

       GLOB_PERIOD
              Allow a leading period to be matched by metacharacters.  By default, metacharacters can't match a leading period.

       GLOB_ALTDIRFUNC
              Use alternative functions pglob->gl_closedir, pglob->gl_readdir, pglob->gl_opendir, pglob->gl_lstat, and pglob->gl_stat for filesystem access instead of the normal library functions.

       GLOB_BRACE
              Expand csh(1) style brace expressions of the form {a,b}.  Brace expressions can be nested.  Thus, for example, specifying the pattern "{foo/{,cat,dog},bar}" would return the  same  results
              as four separate glob() calls using the strings: "foo/", "foo/cat", "foo/dog", and "bar".

       GLOB_NOMAGIC
              If the pattern contains no metacharacters, then it should be returned as the sole matching word, even if there is no file with that name.

       GLOB_TILDE
              Carry  out  tilde  expansion.  If a tilde ('~') is the only character in the pattern, or an initial tilde is followed immediately by a slash ('/'), then the home directory of the caller is
              substituted for the tilde.  If an initial tilde is followed by a username (e.g., "~andrea/bin"), then the tilde and username are substituted by the home directory of  that  user.   If  the
              username is invalid, or the home directory cannot be determined, then no substitution is performed.

       GLOB_TILDE_CHECK
              This  provides behavior similar to that of GLOB_TILDE.  The difference is that if the username is invalid, or the home directory cannot be determined, then instead of using the pattern it‐
              self as the name, glob() returns GLOB_NOMATCH to indicate an error.

       GLOB_ONLYDIR
              This is a hint to glob() that the caller is interested only in directories that match the pattern.  If the implementation can easily  determine  file-type  information,  then  nondirectory
              files  are  not  returned  to  the  caller.  However, the caller must still check that returned files are directories.  (The purpose of this flag is merely to optimize performance when the
              caller is interested only in directories.)

       If errfunc is not NULL, it will be called in case of an error with the arguments epath, a pointer to the path which failed, and eerrno, the value of errno as returned from one  of  the  calls  to
       opendir(3), readdir(3), or stat(2).  If errfunc returns nonzero, or if GLOB_ERR is set, glob() will terminate after the call to errfunc.

       Upon successful return, pglob->gl_pathc contains the number of matched pathnames and pglob->gl_pathv contains a pointer to the list of pointers to matched pathnames.  The list of pointers is ter‐
       minated by a null pointer.

       It is possible to call glob() several times.  In that case, the GLOB_APPEND flag has to be set in flags on the second and later invocations.

       As a GNU extension, pglob->gl_flags is set to the flags specified, ored with GLOB_MAGCHAR if any metacharacters were found.

RETURN VALUE
       On successful completion, glob() returns zero.  Other possible returns are:

       GLOB_NOSPACE
              for running out of memory,

       GLOB_ABORTED
              for a read error, and

       GLOB_NOMATCH
              for no found matches.

STANDARDS
       POSIX.1-2008.

HISTORY
       POSIX.1-2001, POSIX.2.

NOTES
       The structure elements gl_pathc and gl_offs are declared as size_t in glibc 2.1, as they should be according to POSIX.2, but are declared as int in glibc 2.0.

BUGS
       The glob() function may fail due to failure of underlying function calls, such as malloc(3) or opendir(3).  These will store their error code in errno.

EXAMPLES
       One example of use is the following code, which simulates typing

           ls -l *.c ../*.c

       in the shell:

           glob_t globbuf;

           globbuf.gl_offs = 2;
           glob("*.c", GLOB_DOOFFS, NULL, &globbuf);
           glob("../*.c", GLOB_DOOFFS | GLOB_APPEND, NULL, &globbuf);
           globbuf.gl_pathv[0] = "ls";
           globbuf.gl_pathv[1] = "-l";
           execvp("ls", &globbuf.gl_pathv[0]);

NAME
       glob, globfree — generate pathnames matching a pattern

SYNOPSIS
       #include <glob.h>

       int glob(const char *restrict pattern, int flags,
           int(*errfunc)(const char *epath, int eerrno),
           glob_t *restrict pglob);
       void globfree(glob_t *pglob);

DESCRIPTION
       The glob() function is a pathname generator that shall implement the rules defined in the Shell and Utilities volume of POSIX.1‐2017, Section 2.13, Pattern Matching Notation, with  optional  sup‐
       port for rule 3 in the Shell and Utilities volume of POSIX.1‐2017, Section 2.13.3, Patterns Used for Filename Expansion.

       The structure type glob_t is defined in <glob.h> and includes at least the following members:

                                                                    ┌──────────────┬──────────────┬─────────────────────────────────────────┐

       The argument pattern is a pointer to a pathname pattern to be expanded. The glob() function shall match all accessible pathnames against this pattern and develop a  list  of  all  pathnames  that
       match.  In  order  to have access to a pathname, glob() requires search permission on every component of a path except the last, and read permission on each directory of any filename component of
       pattern that contains any of the following special characters: '*', '?', and '['.

       The glob() function shall store the number of matched pathnames into pglob->gl_pathc and a pointer to a list of pointers to pathnames into pglob->gl_pathv. The pathnames shall be in sort order as
       defined  by  the current setting of the LC_COLLATE category; see the Base Definitions volume of POSIX.1‐2017, Section 7.3.2, LC_COLLATE.  The first pointer after the last pathname shall be a null
       pointer. If the pattern does not match any pathnames, the returned number of matched paths is set to 0, and the contents of pglob->gl_pathv are implementation-defined.

       It is the caller's responsibility to create the structure pointed to by pglob.  The glob() function shall allocate other space as needed,  including  the  memory  pointed  to  by  gl_pathv.   The
       globfree() function shall free any space associated with pglob from a previous call to glob().

       The flags argument is used to control the behavior of glob().  The value of flags is a bitwise-inclusive OR of zero or more of the following constants, which are defined in <glob.h>:

       GLOB_APPEND   Append pathnames generated to the ones from a previous call to glob().

       GLOB_DOOFFS   Make use of pglob->gl_offs. If this flag is set, pglob->gl_offs is used to specify how many null pointers to add to the beginning of pglob->gl_pathv. In other words, pglob->gl_pathv
                     shall point to pglob->gl_offs null pointers, followed by pglob->gl_pathc pathname pointers, followed by a null pointer.

       GLOB_ERR      Cause glob() to return when it encounters a directory that it cannot open or read.  Ordinarily, glob() continues to find matches.

       GLOB_MARK     Each pathname that is a directory that matches pattern shall have a <slash> appended.

       GLOB_NOCHECK  Supports rule 3 in the Shell and Utilities volume of POSIX.1‐2017, Section 2.13.3, Patterns Used for Filename Expansion.  If pattern does not match any pathname, then  glob()  shall
                     return a list consisting of only pattern, and the number of matched pathnames is 1.

       GLOB_NOESCAPE Disable backslash escaping.

       GLOB_NOSORT   Ordinarily,  glob() sorts the matching pathnames according to the current setting of the LC_COLLATE category; see the Base Definitions volume of POSIX.1‐2017, Section 7.3.2, LC_COL‐
                     LATE.  When this flag is used, the order of pathnames returned is unspecified.

       The GLOB_APPEND flag can be used to append a new set of pathnames to those found in a previous call to glob().  The following rules apply to applications when two or more calls to glob() are made
       with the same value of pglob and without intervening calls to globfree():

        1. The first such call shall not set GLOB_APPEND. All subsequent calls shall set it.

        2. All the calls shall set GLOB_DOOFFS, or all shall not set it.

        3. After the second call, pglob->gl_pathv points to a list containing the following:

            a. Zero or more null pointers, as specified by GLOB_DOOFFS and pglob->gl_offs.

            b. Pointers to the pathnames that were in the pglob->gl_pathv list before the call, in the same order as before.

            c. Pointers to the new pathnames generated by the second call, in the specified order.

        4. The count returned in pglob->gl_pathc shall be the total number of pathnames from the two calls.

        5. The  application can change any of the fields after a call to glob().  If it does, the application shall reset them to the original value before a subsequent call, using the same pglob value,
           to globfree() or glob() with the GLOB_APPEND flag.

       If, during the search, a directory is encountered that cannot be opened or read and errfunc is not a null pointer, glob() calls (()*errfunc ) with two arguments:

        1. The epath argument is a pointer to the path that failed.

        2. The eerrno argument is the value of errno from the failure, as set by opendir(), readdir(), or stat().  (Other values may be used to report other errors not explicitly  documented  for  those
           functions.)

       If  (()*errfunc  )  is called and returns non-zero, or if the GLOB_ERR flag is set in flags, glob() shall stop the scan and return GLOB_ABORTED after setting gl_pathc and gl_pathv in pglob to re‐
       flect the paths already scanned. If GLOB_ERR is not set and either errfunc is a null pointer or (()*errfunc ) returns 0, the error shall be ignored.

       The glob() function shall not fail because of large files.

RETURN VALUE
       Upon successful completion, glob() shall return 0. The argument pglob->gl_pathc shall return the number of matched pathnames and the argument pglob->gl_pathv shall contain a pointer  to  a  null-
       terminated list of matched and sorted pathnames. However, if pglob->gl_pathc is 0, the content of pglob->gl_pathv is undefined.

       The globfree() function shall not return a value.

       If glob() terminates due to an error, it shall return one of the non-zero constants defined in <glob.h>.  The arguments pglob->gl_pathc and pglob->gl_pathv are still set as defined above.

ERRORS
       The glob() function shall fail and return the corresponding value if:

       GLOB_ABORTED  The scan was stopped because GLOB_ERR was set or (()*errfunc ) returned non-zero.

       GLOB_NOMATCH  The pattern does not match any existing pathname, and GLOB_NOCHECK was not set in flags.

       GLOB_NOSPACE  An attempt to allocate memory failed.

       The following sections are informative.

EXAMPLES
       One  use  of the GLOB_DOOFFS flag is by applications that build an argument list for use with execv(), execve(), or execvp().  Suppose, for example, that an application wants to do the equivalent
       of:

           ls -l *.c

       but for some reason:

           system("ls -l *.c")

       is not acceptable. The application could obtain approximately the same result using the sequence:

           globbuf.gl_offs = 2;
           glob("*.c", GLOB_DOOFFS, NULL, &globbuf);
           globbuf.gl_pathv[0] = "ls";
           globbuf.gl_pathv[1] = "-l";
           execvp("ls", &globbuf.gl_pathv[0]);

       Using the same example:

           ls -l *.c *.h

       could be approximately simulated using GLOB_APPEND as follows:

           globbuf.gl_offs = 2;
           glob("*.c", GLOB_DOOFFS, NULL, &globbuf);
           glob("*.h", GLOB_DOOFFS|GLOB_APPEND, NULL, &globbuf);
           ...

APPLICATION USAGE
       This function is not provided for the purpose of enabling utilities to perform pathname expansion on their arguments, as this operation is performed by the shell, and utilities are explicitly not
       expected to redo this. Instead, it is provided for applications that need to do pathname expansion on strings obtained from other sources, such as a pattern typed by a user or read from a file.

       If a utility needs to see if a pathname matches a given pattern, it can use fnmatch().

       Note  that  gl_pathc and gl_pathv have meaning even if glob() fails. This allows glob() to report partial results in the event of an error. However, if gl_pathc is 0, gl_pathv is unspecified even
       if glob() did not return an error.

       The GLOB_NOCHECK option could be used when an application wants to expand a pathname if wildcards are specified, but wants to treat the pattern as just a string otherwise. The  sh  utility  might
       use this for option-arguments, for example.

       The new pathnames generated by a subsequent call with GLOB_APPEND are not sorted together with the previous pathnames. This mirrors the way that the shell handles pathname expansion when multiple
       expansions are done on a command line.

       Applications that need tilde and parameter expansion should use wordexp().

RATIONALE
       It was claimed that the GLOB_DOOFFS flag is unnecessary because it could be simulated using:

           new = (char **)malloc((n + pglob->gl_pathc + 1)
                  * sizeof(char *));
           (void) memcpy(new+n, pglob->gl_pathv,
                  pglob->gl_pathc * sizeof(char *));
           (void) memset(new, 0, n * sizeof(char *));
           free(pglob->gl_pathv);
           pglob->gl_pathv = new;

       However, this assumes that the memory pointed to by gl_pathv is a block that was separately created using malloc().  This is not necessarily the case. An application should  make  no  assumptions
       about  how the memory referenced by fields in pglob was allocated. It might have been obtained from malloc() in a large chunk and then carved up within glob(), or it might have been created using
       a different memory allocator. It is not the intent of the standard developers to specify or imply how the memory used by glob() is managed.

       The GLOB_APPEND flag would be used when an application wants to expand several different patterns into a single list.

FUTURE DIRECTIONS
       None.

NAME
       glob - globbing pathnames

DESCRIPTION
       Long ago, in UNIX V6, there was a program /etc/glob that would expand wildcard patterns.  Soon afterward this became a shell built-in.

       These days there is also a library routine glob(3) that will perform this function for a user program.

       The rules are as follows (POSIX.2, 3.13).

   Wildcard matching
       A  string  is a wildcard pattern if it contains one of the characters '?', '*', or '['.  Globbing is the operation that expands a wildcard pattern into the list of pathnames matching the pattern.
       Matching is defined by:

       A '?' (not between brackets) matches any single character.

       A '*' (not between brackets) matches any string, including the empty string.

       Character classes

       An expression "[...]" where the first character after the leading '[' is not an '!' matches a single character, namely any of the characters enclosed by the brackets.  The string enclosed by  the
       brackets cannot be empty; therefore ']' can be allowed between the brackets, provided that it is the first character.  (Thus, "[][!]" matches the three characters '[', ']', and '!'.)

       Ranges

       There is one special convention: two characters separated by '-' denote a range.  (Thus, "[A-Fa-f0-9]" is equivalent to "[ABCDEFabcdef0123456789]".)  One may include '-' in its literal meaning by
       making it the first or last character between the brackets.  (Thus, "[]-]" matches just the two characters ']' and '-', and "[--0]" matches the three characters '-', '.', and '0', since '/'  can‐
       not be matched.)

       Complementation

       An expression "[!...]" matches a single character, namely any character that is not matched by the expression obtained by removing the first '!' from it.  (Thus, "[!]a-]" matches any single char‐
       acter except ']', 'a', and '-'.)

       One can remove the special meaning of '?', '*', and '[' by preceding them by a backslash, or, in case this is part of a shell command line, enclosing them in quotes.  Between brackets these char‐
       acters stand for themselves.  Thus, "[[?*\]" matches the four characters '[', '?', '*', and '\'.

   Pathnames
       Globbing  is  applied  on  each of the components of a pathname separately.  A '/' in a pathname cannot be matched by a '?' or '*' wildcard, or by a range like "[.-0]".  A range containing an ex‐
       plicit '/' character is syntactically incorrect.  (POSIX requires that syntactically incorrect patterns are left unchanged.)

       If a filename starts with a '.', this character must be matched explicitly.  (Thus, rm * will not remove .profile, and tar c * will not archive all your files; tar c . is better.)

   Empty lists
       The nice and simple rule given above: "expand a wildcard pattern into the list of matching pathnames" was the original UNIX definition.  It allowed one to have patterns that expand into an  empty
       list, as in

           xv -wait 0 *.gif *.jpg

       where perhaps no *.gif files are present (and this is not an error).  However, POSIX requires that a wildcard pattern is left unchanged when it is syntactically incorrect, or the list of matching
       pathnames is empty.  With bash one can force the classical behavior using this command:

           shopt -s nullglob

       (Similar problems occur elsewhere.  For example, where old scripts have

           rm `find . -name "*~"`

       new scripts require

           rm -f nosuchfile `find . -name "*~"`

       to avoid error messages from rm called with an empty argument list.)

NOTES
   Regular expressions
       Note that wildcard patterns are not regular expressions, although they are a bit similar.  First of all, they match filenames, rather than text, and secondly, the conventions are  not  the  same:
       for example, in a regular expression '*' means zero or more copies of the preceding thing.

       Now that regular expressions have bracket expressions where the negation is indicated by a '^', POSIX has declared the effect of a wildcard pattern "[^...]" to be undefined.

   Character classes and internationalization
       Of course ranges were originally meant to be ASCII ranges, so that "[ -%]" stands for "[ !"#$%]" and "[a-z]" stands for "any lowercase letter".  Some UNIX implementations generalized this so that
       a range X-Y stands for the set of characters with code between the codes for X and for Y.  However, this requires the user to know the character coding in use on the local system,  and  moreover,
       is  not  convenient  if  the collating sequence for the local alphabet differs from the ordering of the character codes.  Therefore, POSIX extended the bracket notation greatly, both for wildcard
       patterns and for regular expressions.  In the above we saw three types of items that can occur in a bracket expression: namely (i) the negation, (ii) explicit single characters, and (iii) ranges.
       POSIX specifies ranges in an internationally more useful way and adds three more types:

       (iii) Ranges X-Y comprise all characters that fall between X and Y (inclusive) in the current collating sequence as defined by the LC_COLLATE category in the current locale.

       (iv) Named character classes, like

       [:alnum:]  [:alpha:]  [:blank:]  [:cntrl:]
       [:digit:]  [:graph:]  [:lower:]  [:print:]
       [:punct:]  [:space:]  [:upper:]  [:xdigit:]

       so  that  one  can  say "[[:lower:]]" instead of "[a-z]", and have things work in Denmark, too, where there are three letters past 'z' in the alphabet.  These character classes are defined by the
       LC_CTYPE category in the current locale.

       (v) Collating symbols, like "[.ch.]" or "[.a-acute.]", where the string between "[." and ".]" is a collating element defined for the current locale.  Note that this may be a  multicharacter  ele‐
       ment.

       (vi)  Equivalence  class  expressions,  like  "[=a=]", where the string between "[=" and "=]" is any collating element from its equivalence class, as defined for the current locale.  For example,
       "[[=a=]]" might be equivalent to "[aáàäâ]", that is, to "[a[.a-acute.][.a-grave.][.a-umlaut.][.a-circumflex.]]".
