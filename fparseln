NAME
     fparseln â€” return the next logical line from a stream

LIBRARY
     Utility functions from BSD systems (libbsd, -lbsd)

SYNOPSIS
     #include <stdio.h>
     (See libbsd(7) for include usage.)

     char *
     fparseln(FILE *stream, size_t *len, size_t *lineno, const char delim[3], int flags);

DESCRIPTION
     The fparseln() function returns a pointer to the next logical line from the stream referenced by stream.  This string is NUL terminated and it is dynamically allocated on each invocation.  It is
     the responsibility of the caller to free the pointer.

     By default, if a character is escaped, both it and the preceding escape character will be present in the returned string.  Various flags alter this behaviour.

     The meaning of the arguments is as follows:

     stream  The stream to read from.

     len     If not NULL, the length of the string is stored in the memory location to which it points.

     lineno  If not NULL, the value of the memory location to which is pointed to, is incremented by the number of lines actually read from the file.

     delim   Contains the escape, continuation, and comment characters.  If a character is NUL then processing for that character is disabled.  If NULL, all characters default to values specified below.
             The contents of delim is as follows:

             delim[0]  The escape character, which defaults to \, is used to remove any special meaning from the next character.

             delim[1]  The continuation character, which defaults to \, is used to indicate that the next line should be concatenated with the current one if this character is the last character on the
                       current line and is not escaped.

             delim[2]  The comment character, which defaults to #, if not escaped indicates the beginning of a comment that extends until the end of the current line.

     flags   If non-zero, alter the operation of fparseln().  The various flags, which may be or-ed together, are:

             FPARSELN_UNESCCOMM  Remove escape preceding an escaped comment.

             FPARSELN_UNESCCONT  Remove escape preceding an escaped continuation.

             FPARSELN_UNESCESC   Remove escape preceding an escaped escape.

             FPARSELN_UNESCREST  Remove escape preceding any other character.

             FPARSELN_UNESCALL   All of the above.

RETURN VALUES
     Upon successful completion a pointer to the parsed line is returned; otherwise, NULL is returned.

     The fparseln() function uses internally getline(3), so all error conditions that apply to getline(3), apply to fparseln().  In addition fparseln() may set errno to [ENOMEM] and return NULL if it
     runs out of memory.

SEE ALSO
     getline(3)

HISTORY
     The fparseln() function first appeared in NetBSD 1.4.
