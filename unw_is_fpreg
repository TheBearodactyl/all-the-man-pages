NAME
       unw_is_fpreg -- check if a register is a floating-point register

SYNOPSIS
       #include <libunwind.h>

       int unw_is_fpreg(unw_regnum_t reg);

DESCRIPTION
       The unw_is_fpreg() routine checks whether register number reg is a floating-point register.

       This routine is normally implemented as a macro and applications should not attempt to take its address.

RETURN VALUE
       The unw_is_fpreg() routine returns a non-zero value if reg is a floating-point register. Otherwise, it returns a value of 0.

THREAD AND SIGNAL SAFETY
       unw_is_fpreg() is thread-safe as well as safe to use from a signal handler.
