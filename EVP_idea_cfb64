NAME
       EVP_idea_cbc, EVP_idea_cfb, EVP_idea_cfb64, EVP_idea_ecb, EVP_idea_ofb - EVP IDEA cipher

SYNOPSIS
        #include <openssl/evp.h>

        const EVP_CIPHER *EVP_idea_cbc(void);
        const EVP_CIPHER *EVP_idea_cfb(void);
        const EVP_CIPHER *EVP_idea_cfb64(void);
        const EVP_CIPHER *EVP_idea_ecb(void);
        const EVP_CIPHER *EVP_idea_ofb(void);

DESCRIPTION
       The IDEA encryption algorithm for EVP.

       EVP_idea_cbc(), EVP_idea_cfb(), EVP_idea_cfb64(), EVP_idea_ecb(), EVP_idea_ofb()
           The IDEA encryption algorithm in CBC, CFB, ECB and OFB modes respectively.

RETURN VALUES
       These functions return an EVP_CIPHER structure that contains the implementation of the symmetric cipher. See EVP_CIPHER_meth_new(3) for details of the EVP_CIPHER structure.
