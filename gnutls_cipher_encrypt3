NAME
       gnutls_cipher_encrypt3 - API function

SYNOPSIS
       #include <gnutls/crypto.h>

       int gnutls_cipher_encrypt3(gnutls_cipher_hd_t handle, const void * ptext, size_t ptext_len, void * ctext, size_t * ctext_len, unsigned flags);

ARGUMENTS
       gnutls_cipher_hd_t handle
                   is a gnutls_cipher_hd_t type

       const void * ptext
                   the data to encrypt

       size_t ptext_len
                   the length of data to encrypt

       void * ctext
                   the encrypted data

       size_t * ctext_len
                   the length of encrypted data (initially must hold the maximum available size)

       unsigned flags
                   flags for padding

DESCRIPTION
       This  function  will  encrypt the given data using the algorithm specified by the context. For block ciphers,  ptext_len is typically a multiple of the block size. If not, the caller can instruct
       the function to pad the last block according to  flags .  Currently, the only available padding scheme is GNUTLS_CIPHER_PADDING_PKCS7.

       If  ctext is not NULL, it must hold enough space to store resulting cipher text. To check the required size, this function can be called with  ctext set to NULL. Then  ctext_len will  be  updated
       without performing actual encryption.

RETURNS
       Zero or a negative error code on error.
