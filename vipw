       vigr [options]

DESCRIPTION
       vipw edits the password file after setting the appropriate locks, and does any necessary processing after the password file is unlocked. If the password file is already locked for editing by
       another user, vipw will ask you to try again later. The default editor for vipw and vigr is vi(1). vigr edits the group file in the same manner as vipw does the passwd file.
