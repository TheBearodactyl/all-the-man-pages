NAME
       pthread_mutex_consistent - make a robust mutex consistent

LIBRARY
       POSIX threads library (libpthread, -lpthread)

SYNOPSIS
       #include <pthread.h>

       int pthread_mutex_consistent(pthread_mutex_t *mutex);

   Feature Test Macro Requirements for glibc (see feature_test_macros(7)):

       pthread_mutex_consistent():
           _POSIX_C_SOURCE >= 200809L

DESCRIPTION
       This  function makes a robust mutex consistent if it is in an inconsis‐
       tent state.  A mutex can be left in an inconsistent state if its  owner
       terminates  while  holding  the mutex, in which case the next owner who
       acquires the mutex will succeed and be notified by a  return  value  of
       EOWNERDEAD from a call to pthread_mutex_lock().

RETURN VALUE
       On  success,  pthread_mutex_consistent()  returns 0.  Otherwise, it re‐
       turns a positive error number to indicate the error.

ERRORS
       EINVAL The mutex is either not robust or  is  not  in  an  inconsistent
              state.

STANDARDS
       POSIX.1-2008.

HISTORY
       glibc 2.12.  POSIX.1-2008.

       Before  the  addition of pthread_mutex_consistent() to POSIX, glibc de‐
       fined the following equivalent nonstandard function if _GNU_SOURCE  was
       defined:

       [[deprecated]]
       int pthread_mutex_consistent_np(const pthread_mutex_t *mutex);

       This  GNU-specific  API, which first appeared in glibc 2.4, is nowadays
       obsolete and should not be used in new programs; since  glibc  2.34  it
       has been marked as deprecated.

NOTES
       pthread_mutex_consistent()  simply  informs the implementation that the
       state (shared data) guarded by the mutex has been restored to a consis‐
       tent state and that normal operations can now be performed with the mu‐
       tex.  It is the application's responsibility to ensure that the  shared
       data has been restored to a consistent state before calling pthread_mu‐
       tex_consistent().

EXAMPLES
       See pthread_mutexattr_setrobust(3).

PROLOG
       This  manual  page is part of the POSIX Programmer's Manual.  The Linux
       implementation of this interface may differ (consult the  corresponding
       Linux  manual page for details of Linux behavior), or the interface may
       not be implemented on Linux.

NAME
       pthread_mutex_consistent — mark state protected by robust mutex as con‐
       sistent

SYNOPSIS
       #include <pthread.h>

       int pthread_mutex_consistent(pthread_mutex_t *mutex);

DESCRIPTION
       If  mutex  is  a robust mutex in an inconsistent state, the pthread_mu‐
       tex_consistent() function can be used to mark the  state  protected  by
       the mutex referenced by mutex as consistent again.

       If  an  owner of a robust mutex terminates while holding the mutex, the
       mutex becomes inconsistent and the next thread that acquires the  mutex
       lock  shall  be notified of the state by the return value [EOWNERDEAD].
       In this case, the mutex does not become normally usable again until the
       state is marked consistent.

       If  the  thread  which  acquired  the  mutex lock with the return value
       [EOWNERDEAD] terminates  before  calling  either  pthread_mutex_consis‐
       tent() or pthread_mutex_unlock(), the next thread that acquires the mu‐
       tex lock shall be notified about the state of the mutex by  the  return
       value [EOWNERDEAD].

       The  behavior is undefined if the value specified by the mutex argument
       to pthread_mutex_consistent() does not refer to an initialized mutex.

RETURN VALUE
       Upon successful  completion,  the  pthread_mutex_consistent()  function
       shall return zero. Otherwise, an error value shall be returned to indi‐
       cate the error.

ERRORS
       The pthread_mutex_consistent() function shall fail if:

       EINVAL The mutex object referenced by mutex is not robust or  does  not
              protect an inconsistent state.

       These functions shall not return an error code of [EINTR].

       The following sections are informative.

EXAMPLES
       None.

APPLICATION USAGE
       The pthread_mutex_consistent() function is only responsible for notify‐
       ing the implementation that the state protected by the mutex  has  been
       recovered  and that normal operations with the mutex can be resumed. It
       is the responsibility of the application to recover the state so it can
       be  reused.  If the application is not able to perform the recovery, it
       can notify the implementation that the situation is unrecoverable by  a
       call  to  pthread_mutex_unlock()  without  a  prior call to pthread_mu‐
       tex_consistent(), in which case subsequent threads that attempt to lock
       the  mutex  will fail to acquire the lock and be returned [ENOTRECOVER‐
       ABLE].

RATIONALE
       If an implementation detects that the value specified by the mutex  ar‐
       gument  to  pthread_mutex_consistent() does not refer to an initialized
       mutex, it is recommended that the function should fail  and  report  an
       [EINVAL] error.

FUTURE DIRECTIONS
       None.
