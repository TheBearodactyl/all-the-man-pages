NAME
       TAP::Parser::Iterator::Process - Iterator for process-based TAP sources

VERSION
       Version 3.44

SYNOPSIS
         use TAP::Parser::Iterator::Process;
         my %args = (
          command  => ['python', 'setup.py', 'test'],
          merge    => 1,
          setup    => sub { ... },
          teardown => sub { ... },
         );
         my $it   = TAP::Parser::Iterator::Process->new(\%args);
         my $line = $it->next;

DESCRIPTION
       This is a simple iterator wrapper for executing external processes, used by TAP::Parser.  Unless you're writing a plugin or subclassing, you probably won't need to use this module directly.

METHODS
   Class Methods
       "new"

       Create an iterator.  Expects one argument containing a hashref of the form:

          command  => \@command_to_execute
          merge    => $attempt_merge_stderr_and_stdout?
          setup    => $callback_to_setup_command
          teardown => $callback_to_teardown_command

       Tries to uses IPC::Open3 & IO::Select to communicate with the spawned process if they are available.  Falls back onto "open()".

   Instance Methods
       "next"

       Iterate through the process output, of course.

       "next_raw"

       Iterate raw input without applying any fixes for quirky input syntax.

       "wait"

       Get the wait status for this iterator's process.

       "exit"

       Get the exit status for this iterator's process.

       "handle_unicode"

       Upgrade the input stream to handle UTF8.

       "get_select_handles"

       Return a list of filehandles that may be used upstream in a select() call to signal that this Iterator is ready. Iterators that are not handle based should return an empty list.
