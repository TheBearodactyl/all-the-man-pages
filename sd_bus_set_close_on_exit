NAME
       sd_bus_set_close_on_exit, sd_bus_get_close_on_exit - Control whether to
       close the bus connection during the event loop exit phase

SYNOPSIS
       #include <systemd/sd-bus.h>

       int sd_bus_set_close_on_exit(sd_bus *bus, int b);

       int sd_bus_get_close_on_exit(sd_bus *bus);

DESCRIPTION
       sd_bus_set_close_on_exit() may be used to enable or disable whether the
       bus connection is automatically flushed (as in sd_bus_flush(3)) and
       closed (as in sd_bus_close(3)) during the exit phase of the event loop.
       This logic only applies to bus connections that are attached to an sd-
       event(3) event loop, see sd_bus_attach_event(3). By default this
       mechanism is enabled and makes sure that any pending messages that have
       not been written to the bus connection are written out when the event
       loop is shutting down. In some cases this behaviour is not desirable,
       for example when the bus connection shall remain usable until after the
       event loop exited. If b is true, the feature is enabled (which is the
       default), otherwise disabled.

       sd_bus_get_close_on_exit() may be used to query the current setting of
       this feature. It returns zero when the feature is disabled, and
       positive if enabled.

RETURN VALUE
       On success, sd_bus_set_close_on_exit() returns a non-negative integer.
       On failure, it returns a negative errno-style error code.

       sd_bus_get_close_on_exit() returns 0 if the feature is currently
       disabled or a positive integer if it is enabled. On failure, it returns
       a negative errno-style error code.

   Errors
       Returned errors may indicate the following problems:

       -ECHILD
           The bus connection was created in a different process.

NOTES
       These APIs are implemented as a shared library, which can be compiled
       and linked to with the libsystemd pkg-config(1) file.
