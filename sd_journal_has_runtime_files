NAME
       sd_journal_has_runtime_files, sd_journal_has_persistent_files - Query
       availability of runtime or persistent journal files

SYNOPSIS
       #include <systemd/sd-journal.h>

       int sd_journal_has_runtime_files(sd_journal *j);

       int sd_journal_has_persistent_files(sd_journal *j);

DESCRIPTION
       sd_journal_has_runtime_files() returns a positive value if runtime
       journal files (present in /run/systemd/journal/) have been found.
       Otherwise returns 0.

       sd_journal_has_persistent_files() returns a positive value if
       persistent journal files (present in /var/log/journal/) have been
       found. Otherwise returns 0.

RETURN VALUE
       Both sd_journal_has_runtime_files() and
       sd_journal_has_persistent_files() return -EINVAL if their argument is
       NULL.

NOTES
       All functions listed here are thread-agnostic and only a single
       specific thread may operate on a given object during its entire
       lifetime. It's safe to allocate multiple independent objects and use
       each from a specific thread in parallel. However, it's not safe to
       allocate such an object in one thread, and operate or free it from any
       other, even if locking is used to ensure these threads don't operate on
       it at the very same time.

       These APIs are implemented as a shared library, which can be compiled
       and linked to with the libsystemd pkg-config(1) file.
