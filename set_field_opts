form_field_opts(3X)                                        form_field_opts(3X)

NAME
       set_field_opts, field_opts_on, field_opts_off, field_opts - set and get
       field options

SYNOPSIS
       #include <form.h>

       int set_field_opts(FIELD *field, Field_Options opts);
       Field_Options field_opts(const FIELD *field);

       int field_opts_on(FIELD *field, Field_Options opts);
       int field_opts_off(FIELD *field, Field_Options opts);

DESCRIPTION
       The function set_field_opts sets all  the  given  field's  option  bits
       (field option bits may be logically-OR'ed together).

       The  function  field_opts_on turns on the given option bits, and leaves
       others alone.

       The function field_opts_off turns off the given option bits, and leaves
       others alone.

       The function field_opts returns the field's current option bits.

       The following standard options are defined (all are on by default):

       O_ACTIVE
            The  field  is  visited during processing.  If this option is off,
            the field will not be reachable by navigation keys.  Please notice
            that an invisible field appears to be inactive also.

       O_AUTOSKIP
            Skip to the next field when this one fills.

       O_BLANK
            The  field is cleared whenever a character is entered at the first
            position.

       O_EDIT
            The field can be edited.

       O_NULLOK
            Allow a blank field.

       O_PASSOK
            Validate field only if modified by user.

       O_PUBLIC
            The field contents are displayed as data is entered.

       O_STATIC
            Field buffers are fixed to field's original size.  Turn  this  op‐
            tion off to create a dynamic field.

       O_VISIBLE
            The  field  is  displayed.   If this option is off, display of the
            field is suppressed.

       O_WRAP
            Words that do not fit on a line are  wrapped  to  the  next  line.
            Words are blank-separated.

       These extension options are defined (extensions are off by default):

       O_DYNAMIC_JUSTIFY
            Permit dynamic fields to be justified, like static fields.

       O_NO_LEFT_STRIP
            Preserve leading whitespace in the field buffer, which is normally
            discarded.

       O_EDGE_INSERT_STAY
            When inserting into a field up to the boundary  position,  option‐
            ally  delay the scrolling, so that the last inserted character re‐
            mains visible, but advance the cursor to  reflect  the  insertion.
            This  allows the form library to display the inserted character in
            one-character fields as well as allowing the library  to  maintain
            consistent state.

       O_INPUT_FIELD
            The set_max_field function checks for this extension, which allows
            a dynamic field to shrink if the new limit  is  smaller  than  the
            current field size.

RETURN VALUE
       Except for field_opts, each routine returns one of the following:

       E_OK The routine succeeded.

       E_BAD_ARGUMENT
            Routine detected an incorrect or out-of-range argument.

       E_CURRENT
            The field is the current field.

       E_SYSTEM_ERROR
            System error occurred (see errno(3)).

NOTES
       The  header  file  <form.h>  automatically  includes  the  header  file
       <curses.h>.

PORTABILITY
       These routines emulate the System V forms library.  They were not  sup‐
       ported on Version 7 or BSD versions.
