NAME
       sddm - the simple desktop display manager

SYNOPSIS
       sddm [OPTIONS...]

DESCRIPTION
       sddm is a display and login manager based on Qt technologies.

       Using QtQuick and QML, designers are given the ability to easily create
       pleasant, modern looking interfaces for sddm.

       sddm runs the greeter as a system user named sddm whose home  directory
       needs to be set to /var/lib/sddm.

       If  pam  and systemd are available, the greeter will go through logind,
       which will give it access to drm devices.

       Distributions without pam and systemd will need to put  the  sddm  user
       into  the  video  group,  otherwise errors regarding GL and drm devices
       might be experienced.

OPTIONS
       --test-mode
              Start daemon in test mode.

       --example-config
              Print the complete current configuration to stdout

       --help, -h
              Show help message and exit.
