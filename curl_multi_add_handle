NAME
       curl_multi_add_handle - add an easy handle to a multi session

SYNOPSIS
       #include <curl/curl.h>

       CURLMcode curl_multi_add_handle(CURLM *multi_handle, CURL *easy_handle);

DESCRIPTION
       Adds a standard easy handle to the multi stack. This function call will make this multi_handle control the specified easy_handle.

       While  an  easy  handle is added to a multi stack, you cannot and you must not use curl_easy_perform(3) on that handle. After having removed the easy handle from the multi stack again, it is per‐
       fectly fine to use it with the easy interface again.

       If the easy handle is not set to use a shared (CURLOPT_SHARE(3)) or global DNS cache (CURLOPT_DNS_USE_GLOBAL_CACHE(3)), it will be made to use the DNS cache that is shared between all  easy  han‐
       dles within the multi handle when curl_multi_add_handle(3) is called.

       When an easy interface is added to a multi handle, it will use a shared connection cache owned by the multi handle. Removing and adding new easy handles will not affect the pool of connections or
       the ability to do connection re-use.

       If you have CURLMOPT_TIMERFUNCTION(3) set in the multi handle (and you really should if you are working event-based with curl_multi_socket_action(3) and friends), that  callback  will  be  called
       from within this function to ask for an updated timer so that your main event loop will get the activity on this handle to get started.

       The easy handle will remain added to the multi handle until you remove it again with curl_multi_remove_handle(3) - even when a transfer with that specific easy handle is completed.

       You should remove the easy handle from the multi stack before you terminate first the easy handle and then the multi handle:

       1 - curl_multi_remove_handle(3)

       2 - curl_easy_cleanup(3)

       3 - curl_multi_cleanup(3)

EXAMPLE
         /* init a multi stack */
         multi_handle = curl_multi_init();

         /* add individual transfers */
         curl_multi_add_handle(multi_handle, http_handle);
         curl_multi_add_handle(multi_handle, http_handle2);

AVAILABILITY

RETURN VALUE
       CURLMcode type, general libcurl multi interface error code.
