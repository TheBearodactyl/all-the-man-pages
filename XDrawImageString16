XDrawImageString(3)                                                                           XLIB FUNCTIONS                                                                           XDrawImageString(3)

NAME
       XDrawImageString, XDrawImageString16 - draw image text

SYNTAX
       int XDrawImageString(Display *display, Drawable d, GC gc, int x, int y, _Xconst char *string, int length);

       int XDrawImageString16(Display *display, Drawable d, GC gc, int x, int y, _Xconst XChar2b *string, int length);

ARGUMENTS
       d         Specifies the drawable.

       display   Specifies the connection to the X server.

       gc        Specifies the GC.

       length    Specifies the number of characters in the string argument.

       string    Specifies the character string.

       x
       y         Specify the x and y coordinates, which are relative to the origin of the specified drawable and define the origin of the first character.

DESCRIPTION
       The XDrawImageString16 function is similar to XDrawImageString except that it uses 2-byte or 16-bit characters.  Both functions also use both the foreground and background pixels of the GC in the
       destination.

       The effect is first to fill a destination rectangle with the background pixel defined in the GC and then to paint the text with the foreground pixel.  The upper-left corner of the filled  rectan‚Äê
       gle is at:

       [x, y - font-ascent]

       The width is:

       overall-width

       The height is:

       font-ascent + font-descent

       The overall-width, font-ascent, and font-descent are as would be returned by XQueryTextExtents using gc and string.  The function and fill-style defined in the GC are ignored for these functions.
       The effective function is GXcopy, and the effective fill-style is FillSolid.

       For fonts defined with 2-byte matrix indexing and used with XDrawImageString, each byte is used as a byte2 with a byte1 of zero.

       Both functions use these GC components: plane-mask, foreground, background, font, subwindow-mode, clip-x-origin, clip-y-origin, and clip-mask.

       XDrawImageString and XDrawImageString16 can generate BadDrawable, BadGC, and BadMatch errors.

DIAGNOSTICS
       BadDrawable
                 A value for a Drawable argument does not name a defined Window or Pixmap.

       BadGC     A value for a GContext argument does not name a defined GContext.

       BadMatch  An InputOnly window is used as a Drawable.

       BadMatch  Some argument or pair of arguments has the correct type and range but fails to match in some other way required by the request.

NOTES
       Unlike XDrawString and XDrawString16, these functions send no more than 255 characters at a time to the server.  When the total number of characters to be sent is larger than 255, these functions
       split the string into chunks up to 255 characters.  After sending each chunk, these functions query the server to determine the actual text extent.
