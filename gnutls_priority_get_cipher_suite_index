NAME
       gnutls_priority_get_cipher_suite_index - API function

SYNOPSIS
       #include <gnutls/gnutls.h>

       int gnutls_priority_get_cipher_suite_index(gnutls_priority_t pcache, unsigned int idx, unsigned int * sidx);

ARGUMENTS
       gnutls_priority_t pcache
                   is a gnutls_priority_t type.

       unsigned int idx
                   is an index number.

       unsigned int * sidx
                   internal index of cipher suite to get information about.

DESCRIPTION
       Provides the internal ciphersuite index to be used with gnutls_cipher_suite_info(). The index  idx provided is an index kept at the priorities structure. It might be that a valid priorities index
       does not correspond to a ciphersuite and in that case GNUTLS_E_UNKNOWN_CIPHER_SUITE will be returned.  Once the last available index is crossed then GNUTLS_E_REQUESTED_DATA_NOT_AVAILABLE will  be
       returned.

RETURNS
       On success it returns GNUTLS_E_SUCCESS (0), or a negative error value otherwise.

SINCE
       3.0.9
