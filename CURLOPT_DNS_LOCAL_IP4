NAME
       CURLOPT_DNS_LOCAL_IP4 - IPv4 address to bind DNS resolves to

SYNOPSIS
       #include <curl/curl.h>

       CURLcode curl_easy_setopt(CURL *handle, CURLOPT_DNS_LOCAL_IP4, char *address);

DESCRIPTION
       Set the local IPv4 address that the resolver should bind to. The argument should be of type char * and contain a single numerical IPv4 address as a string.  Set this option to NULL to use the de‚Äê
       fault setting (do not bind to a specific IP address).

       The application does not have to keep the string around after setting this option.

DEFAULT
       NULL

PROTOCOLS
       All

EXAMPLE
       CURL *curl = curl_easy_init();
       if(curl) {
         curl_easy_setopt(curl, CURLOPT_URL, "https://example.com/foo.bin");
         curl_easy_setopt(curl, CURLOPT_DNS_LOCAL_IP4, "192.168.0.14");
         ret = curl_easy_perform(curl);
         curl_easy_cleanup(curl);
       }

AVAILABILITY
       This option requires that libcurl was built with a resolver backend that supports this operation. The c-ares backend is the only such one.

       Added in 7.33.0

RETURN VALUE
       Returns CURLE_OK if the option is supported, CURLE_UNKNOWN_OPTION if not, CURLE_NOT_BUILT_IN if support was disabled at compile-time, or CURLE_BAD_FUNCTION_ARGUMENT when given a bad address.
