NAME
       libssh2_knownhost_get - get a known host off the collection of known hosts

SYNOPSIS
       #include <libssh2.h>

       int libssh2_knownhost_get(LIBSSH2_KNOWNHOSTS *hosts,
                                 struct libssh2_knownhost **store,
                                 struct libssh2_knownhost *prev):

DESCRIPTION
       libssh2_knownhost_get(3) allows an application to iterate over all known hosts in the collection.

       store should point to a pointer that gets filled in to point to the known host data.

       prev is a pointer to a previous 'struct libssh2_knownhost' as returned by a previous invoke of this function, or NULL to get the first entry in the internal collection.

RETURN VALUE
       Returns 0 if everything is fine and information about a host was stored in the store struct.

       Returns 1 if it reached the end of hosts.

       Returns negative values for error
