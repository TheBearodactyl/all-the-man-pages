UNW_APPLY_REG_STATE(3)                                                                     Programming Library                                                                      UNW_APPLY_REG_STATE(3)

NAME
       unw_apply_reg_state -- apply a register state update to a cursor

SYNOPSIS
       #include <libunwind.h>

       int unw_apply_reg_state(unw_cursor_t *cp, void *reg_states_data);

DESCRIPTION
       The unw_apply_reg_state() routine updates the register values of a cursor according to the instructions in reg_states_data, which have been obtained by calling unw_reg_states_iterate.

RETURN VALUE
       On successful completion, unw_apply_reg_state() returns 0.  Otherwise the negative value of one of the error-codes below is returned.

THREAD AND SIGNAL SAFETY
       unw_apply_reg_state() is thread-safe. If cursor cp is in the local address-space, this routine is also safe to use from a signal handler.

ERRORS
       UNW_EUNSPEC
               An unspecified error occurred.

       UNW_ENOINFO
               Libunwind was unable to locate unwind-info for the procedure.

       UNW_EBADVERSION
               The unwind-info for the procedure has version or format that is not understood by libunwind.

       In addition, unw_apply_reg_state() may return any error returned by the access_mem() call-back (see unw_create_addr_space(3)).
