NAME
       ppm2tiff - create a TIFF file from PPM, PGM and PBM image files

       Synopsis

       ppm2tiff [ options ] [ input.ppm ] output.tif

DESCRIPTION
       ppm2tiff converts a file in the PPM, PGM and PBM image formats to TIFF.
       By default, the TIFF image is created with data samples packed (Planar‐
       Configuration=1),  compressed  with  the  Packbits  algorithm (Compres‐
       sion=32773), and with each strip no more than 8 kilobytes.  These char‐
       acteristics can be overridden, or explicitly specified with the options
       described below.

       If the PPM file contains greyscale data, then the  PhotometricInterpre‐
       tation tag is set to 1 (min-is-black), otherwise it is set to 2 (RGB).

       If  no  PPM  file  is specified on the command line, ppm2tiff will read
       from the standard input.

OPTIONS
       -c compress
              Specify a compression scheme to use when writing image data:  -c
              none  for  no  compression, -c packbits for PackBits compression
              (will be used by default), -c lzw for Lempel-Ziv  &  Welch  com‐
              pression,  -c jpeg for baseline JPEG compression, -c zip for De‐
              flate compression, -c g3 for CCITT Group  3  (T.4)  compression,
              and -c g4 for CCITT Group 4 (T.6) compression.

       -r striprows
              Write data with a specified number of rows per strip; by default
              the number of rows/strip is selected so that each strip  is  ap‐
              proximately 8 kilobytes.

       -R resolution
              Mark  the  resultant image to have the specified X and Y resolu‐
              tion (in dots/inch).
