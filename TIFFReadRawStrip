NAME
       TIFFReadRawStrip - return the undecoded contents of a strip of data from an open TIFF file

SYNOPSIS
          #include <tiffio.h>

       tsize_t TIFFReadRawStrip(TIFF *tif, tstrip_t strip, tdata_t buf, tsize_t size)

DESCRIPTION
       Read the contents of the specified strip into the (user supplied) data buffer.  Note that the value of strip is a “raw strip number”. That is, the caller must take into account whether or not the
       data is organized in separate planes (PlanarConfiguration = 2).  To read a full strip of data the data buffer should typically be at least as large as the number returned by TIFFStripSize().

RETURN VALUES
       The actual number of bytes of data that were placed in buf is returned; TIFFReadRawStrip() returns -1 if an error was encountered.

DIAGNOSTICS
       All error messages are directed to the TIFFErrorExtR() routine.
