NAME
       gnutls_pkcs12_mac_info - API function

SYNOPSIS
       #include <gnutls/pkcs12.h>

       int gnutls_pkcs12_mac_info(gnutls_pkcs12_t pkcs12, unsigned int * mac, void * salt, unsigned int * salt_size, unsigned int * iter_count, char ** oid);

ARGUMENTS
       gnutls_pkcs12_t pkcs12
                   A pkcs12 type

       unsigned int * mac
                   the MAC algorithm used as gnutls_mac_algorithm_t

       void * salt the salt used for string to key (if non-NULL then  salt_size initially holds its size)

       unsigned int * salt_size
                   string to key salt size

       unsigned int * iter_count
                   string to key iteration count

       char ** oid if non-NULL it will contain an allocated null-terminated variable with the OID

DESCRIPTION
       This  function  will  provide  information on the MAC algorithm used in a PKCS 12 structure. If the structure algorithms are unknown the code GNUTLS_E_UNKNOWN_HASH_ALGORITHM will be returned, and
       only  oid , will be set. That is,  oid will be set on structures with a MAC whether supported or not. It must be deinitialized using gnutls_free().  The other variables are only set on  supported
       structures.

RETURNS
       GNUTLS_E_INVALID_REQUEST if the provided structure doesn't contain a MAC, GNUTLS_E_UNKNOWN_HASH_ALGORITHM if the structure's MAC isn't supported, or another negative error code in case of a fail‐
       ure. Zero on success.
