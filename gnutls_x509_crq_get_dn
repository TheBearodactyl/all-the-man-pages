NAME
       gnutls_x509_crq_get_dn - API function

SYNOPSIS
       #include <gnutls/x509.h>

       int gnutls_x509_crq_get_dn(gnutls_x509_crq_t crq, char * buf, size_t * buf_size);

ARGUMENTS
       gnutls_x509_crq_t crq
                   should contain a gnutls_x509_crq_t type

       char * buf  a pointer to a structure to hold the name (may be NULL)

       size_t * buf_size
                   initially holds the size of  buf

DESCRIPTION
       This function will copy the name of the Certificate request subject to the provided buffer.  The name will be in the form "C=xxxx,O=yyyy,CN=zzzz" as described in RFC 2253. The output string
        buf will be ASCII or UTF-8 encoded, depending on the certificate data.

       This function does not output a fully RFC4514 compliant string, if that is required see gnutls_x509_crq_get_dn3().

RETURNS
       GNUTLS_E_SHORT_MEMORY_BUFFER if the provided buffer is not long enough, and in that case the * buf_size will be updated with the required size.  On success 0 is returned.
