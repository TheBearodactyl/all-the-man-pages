SYNOPSIS

       #include <pcre2.h>

       void pcre2_convert_context_free(pcre2_convert_context *cvcontext);

DESCRIPTION

       This  function  is  part  of  an experimental set of pattern conversion
       functions.  It frees the memory occupied by a  convert  context,  using
       the  memory freeing function from the general context with which it was
       created, or free() if that was not set. If the argument  is  NULL,  the
       function returns immediately without doing anything.

       The pattern conversion functions are described in the pcre2convert doc‚Äê
       umentation.
