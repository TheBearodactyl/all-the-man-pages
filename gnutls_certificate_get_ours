NAME
       gnutls_certificate_get_ours - API function

SYNOPSIS
       #include <gnutls/gnutls.h>

       const gnutls_datum_t * gnutls_certificate_get_ours(gnutls_session_t session);

ARGUMENTS
       gnutls_session_t session
                   is a gnutls session

DESCRIPTION
       Gets the certificate as sent to the peer in the last handshake.  The certificate is in raw (DER) format.  No certificate list is being returned. Only the first certificate.

       This function returns the certificate that was sent in the current handshake. In subsequent resumed sessions this function will return NULL. That differs from gnutls_certificate_get_peers() which
       always returns the peer's certificate used in the original session.

RETURNS
       a pointer to a gnutls_datum_t containing our certificate, or NULL in case of an error or if no certificate was used.
