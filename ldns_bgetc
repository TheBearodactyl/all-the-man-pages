NAME
       ldns_bget_token, ldns_bgetc, ldns_bskipcs - get tokens from buffers

SYNOPSIS
       #include <stdint.h>
       #include <stdbool.h>

       #include <ldns/ldns.h>

       ssize_t ldns_bget_token(ldns_buffer *b, char *token, const char *delim, size_t limit);

       int ldns_bgetc(ldns_buffer *buffer);

       void ldns_bskipcs(ldns_buffer *buffer, const char *s);

DESCRIPTION
       ldns_bget_token() returns a token/char from the buffer b.  This function deals with ( and ) in the buffer, and ignores when it finds them.
              *b: the buffer to read from
              *token: the token is put here
              *delim: chars at which the parsing should stop
              *limit: how much to read. If 0 the builtin maximum is used
              Returns s 0 on error of EOF of b. Otherwise return the length of what is read

       ldns_bgetc() returns the next character from a buffer. Advances the position pointer with 1.  When end of buffer is reached returns EOF. This is the buffer's equivalent for getc().
              *buffer: buffer to read from
              Returns EOF on failure otherwise return the character

       ldns_bskipcs() skips all of the characters in the given string in the buffer, moving the position to the first character that is not in *s.
              *buffer: buffer to use
              *s: characters to skip
              Returns void
