NAME
       gnutls_x509_crt_get_subject_alt_othername_oid - API function

SYNOPSIS
       #include <gnutls/x509.h>

       int gnutls_x509_crt_get_subject_alt_othername_oid(gnutls_x509_crt_t cert, unsigned int seq, void * oid, size_t * oid_size);

ARGUMENTS
       gnutls_x509_crt_t cert
                   should contain a gnutls_x509_crt_t type

       unsigned int seq
                   specifies the sequence number of the alt name (0 for the first one, 1 for the second etc.)

       void * oid  is the place where the otherName OID will be copied to

       size_t * oid_size
                   holds the size of ret.

DESCRIPTION
       This function will extract the type OID of an otherName Subject Alternative Name, contained in the given certificate, and return the type as an enumerated element.

       This function is only useful if gnutls_x509_crt_get_subject_alt_name() returned GNUTLS_SAN_OTHERNAME.

       If  oid is null then only the size will be filled. The  oid returned will be null terminated, although  oid_size will not account for the trailing null.

RETURNS
       the  alternative  subject  name  type on success, one of the enumerated gnutls_x509_subject_alt_name_t.  For supported OIDs, it will return one of the virtual (GNUTLS_SAN_OTHERNAME_*) types, e.g.
       GNUTLS_SAN_OTHERNAME_XMPP, and GNUTLS_SAN_OTHERNAME for unknown OIDs.  It will return GNUTLS_E_SHORT_MEMORY_BUFFER if
        ian_size is not large enough to hold the value.  In that case
        ian_size will be updated with the required size.  If the certificate does not have an Alternative name with  the  specified  sequence  number  and  with  the  otherName  type  then  GNUTLS_E_RE‐
       QUESTED_DATA_NOT_AVAILABLE is returned.
