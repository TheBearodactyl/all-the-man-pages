SSL_CONF_CTX_SET_FLAGS(3ssl)        OpenSSL       SSL_CONF_CTX_SET_FLAGS(3ssl)

NAME
       SSL_CONF_CTX_set_flags, SSL_CONF_CTX_clear_flags - Set or clear SSL
       configuration context flags

SYNOPSIS
        #include <openssl/ssl.h>

        unsigned int SSL_CONF_CTX_set_flags(SSL_CONF_CTX *cctx, unsigned int flags);
        unsigned int SSL_CONF_CTX_clear_flags(SSL_CONF_CTX *cctx, unsigned int flags);

DESCRIPTION
       The function SSL_CONF_CTX_set_flags() sets flags in the context cctx.

       The function SSL_CONF_CTX_clear_flags() clears flags in the context
       cctx.

NOTES
       The flags set affect how subsequent calls to SSL_CONF_cmd() or
       SSL_CONF_argv() behave.

       Currently the following flags values are recognised:

       SSL_CONF_FLAG_CMDLINE, SSL_CONF_FLAG_FILE
           recognise options intended for command line or configuration file
           use. At least one of these flags must be set.

       SSL_CONF_FLAG_CLIENT, SSL_CONF_FLAG_SERVER
           recognise options intended for use in SSL/TLS clients or servers.
           One or both of these flags must be set.

       SSL_CONF_FLAG_CERTIFICATE
           recognise certificate and private key options.

       SSL_CONF_FLAG_REQUIRE_PRIVATE
           If this option is set then if a private key is not specified for a
           certificate it will attempt to load a private key from the
           certificate file when SSL_CONF_CTX_finish() is called. If a key
           cannot be loaded from the certificate file an error occurs.

       SSL_CONF_FLAG_SHOW_ERRORS
           indicate errors relating to unrecognised options or missing
           arguments in the error queue. If this option isn't set such errors
           are only reflected in the return values of SSL_CONF_set_cmd() or
           SSL_CONF_set_argv()

RETURN VALUES
       SSL_CONF_CTX_set_flags() and SSL_CONF_CTX_clear_flags() returns the new
       flags value after setting or clearing flags.
