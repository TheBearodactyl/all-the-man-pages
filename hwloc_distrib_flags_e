NAME
       hwlocality_helper_distribute - Distributing items over a topology

SYNOPSIS
   Enumerations
       enum hwloc_distrib_flags_e { HWLOC_DISTRIB_FLAG_REVERSE }

   Functions
       static int hwloc_distrib (hwloc_topology_t topology, hwloc_obj_t *roots, unsigned n_roots, hwloc_cpuset_t *set, unsigned n, int until, unsigned long flags)

Detailed Description
Enumeration Type Documentation
   enum hwloc_distrib_flags_e
       Flags to be given to hwloc_distrib().

       Enumerator

       HWLOC_DISTRIB_FLAG_REVERSE
              Distrib in reverse order, starting from the last objects.

Function Documentation
   static int hwloc_distrib (hwloc_topology_t topology, hwloc_obj_t * roots, unsigned n_roots, hwloc_cpuset_t * set, unsigned n, int until, unsigned long flags) [inline],  [static]
       Distribute n items over the topology under roots. Array set will be filled with n cpusets recursively distributed linearly over the topology under objects roots, down to depth until (which can be
       INT_MAX to distribute down to the finest level).

       n_roots is usually 1 and roots only contains the topology root object so as to distribute over the entire topology.

       This is typically useful when an application wants to distribute n threads over a machine, giving each of them as much private cache as possible and keeping them locally in number order.

       The caller may typically want to also call hwloc_bitmap_singlify() before binding a thread so that it does not move at all.

       flags should be 0 or a OR'ed set of hwloc_distrib_flags_e.

       Note
           This function requires the roots objects to have a CPU set.
