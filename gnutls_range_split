NAME
       gnutls_range_split - API function

SYNOPSIS
       #include <gnutls/gnutls.h>

       int gnutls_range_split(gnutls_session_t session, const gnutls_range_st * orig, gnutls_range_st * next, gnutls_range_st * remainder);

ARGUMENTS
       gnutls_session_t session
                   is a gnutls_session_t type

       const gnutls_range_st * orig
                   is the original range provided by the user

       gnutls_range_st * next
                   is the returned range that can be conveyed in a TLS record

       gnutls_range_st * remainder
                   is the returned remaining range

DESCRIPTION
       This  function should be used when it is required to hide the length of very long data that cannot be directly provided to gnutls_record_send_range().  In that case this function should be called
       with the desired length hiding range in  orig . The returned  next value should then be used in the next call to gnutls_record_send_range() with the partial data.  That process should be repeated
       until  remainder is (0,0).

RETURNS
       0 in case splitting succeeds, non zero in case of error.  Note that  orig is not changed, while the values of  next and  remainder are modified to store the resulting values.
