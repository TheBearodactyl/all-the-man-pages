NAME
       io_uring_buf_ring_cq_advance - advance index of provided buffer and CQ ring

SYNOPSIS
       #include <liburing.h>

       void io_uring_buf_ring_cq_advance(struct io_uring *ring,
                                         struct io_uring_buf_ring *br,
                                         int count);

DESCRIPTION
       The  io_uring_buf_ring_cq_advance(3) commits count previously added buffers to the shared buffer ring br, making them visible to the kernel and hence consumable. This passes ownership of the buf‐
       fer to the ring. At the same time, it advances the CQ ring of ring by count amount. This effectively bundles both a io_uring_buf_ring_advance(3) call and a io_uring_cq_avance(3) into  one  opera‐
       tion. Since updating either ring index entails a store memory barrier, doing both at once is more efficient.

RETURN VALUE
       None
