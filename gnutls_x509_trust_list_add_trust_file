NAME
       gnutls_x509_trust_list_add_trust_file - API function

SYNOPSIS
       #include <gnutls/x509.h>

       int gnutls_x509_trust_list_add_trust_file(gnutls_x509_trust_list_t list, const char * ca_file, const char * crl_file, gnutls_x509_crt_fmt_t type, unsigned int tl_flags, unsigned int tl_vflags);

ARGUMENTS
       gnutls_x509_trust_list_t list
                   The list

       const char * ca_file
                   A file containing a list of CAs (optional)

       const char * crl_file
                   A file containing a list of CRLs (optional)

       gnutls_x509_crt_fmt_t type
                   The format of the certificates

       unsigned int tl_flags
                   flags from gnutls_trust_list_flags_t

       unsigned int tl_vflags
                   gnutls_certificate_verify_flags if flags specifies GNUTLS_TL_VERIFY_CRL

DESCRIPTION
       This  function  will  add the given certificate authorities to the trusted list. PKCS 11 URLs are also accepted, instead of files, by this function. A PKCS 11 URL implies a trust database (a spe‐
       cially marked module in p11-kit); the URL "pkcs11:" implies all trust databases in the system. Only a single URL specifying trust databases can be set; they cannot be stacked with multiple calls.

RETURNS
       The number of added elements is returned.

SINCE
       3.1
