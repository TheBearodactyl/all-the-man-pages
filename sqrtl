NAME
       sqrt, sqrtf, sqrtl - square root function

LIBRARY
       Math library (libm, -lm)

SYNOPSIS
       #include <math.h>

       double sqrt(double x);
       float sqrtf(float x);
       long double sqrtl(long double x);

   Feature Test Macro Requirements for glibc (see feature_test_macros(7)):

       sqrtf(), sqrtl():
           _ISOC99_SOURCE || _POSIX_C_SOURCE >= 200112L
               || /* Since glibc 2.19: */ _DEFAULT_SOURCE
               || /* glibc <= 2.19: */ _BSD_SOURCE || _SVID_SOURCE

DESCRIPTION
       These functions return the nonnegative square root of x.

RETURN VALUE
       On success, these functions return the square root of x.

       If x is a NaN, a NaN is returned.

       If x is +0 (-0), +0 (-0) is returned.

       If x is positive infinity, positive infinity is returned.

       If x is less than -0, a domain error occurs, and a NaN is returned.

ERRORS
       See  math_error(7) for information on how to determine whether an error
       has occurred when calling these functions.

       The following errors can occur:

       Domain error: x less than -0
              errno is set  to  EDOM.   An  invalid  floating-point  exception
              (FE_INVALID) is raised.

PROLOG
       This  manual  page is part of the POSIX Programmer's Manual.  The Linux
       implementation of this interface may differ (consult the  corresponding
       Linux  manual page for details of Linux behavior), or the interface may
       not be implemented on Linux.

NAME
       sqrt, sqrtf, sqrtl — square root function

SYNOPSIS
       #include <math.h>

       double sqrt(double x);
       float sqrtf(float x);
       long double sqrtl(long double x);

DESCRIPTION
       The functionality described on this reference page is aligned with  the
       ISO C  standard.  Any  conflict between the requirements described here
       and the ISO C standard is unintentional. This  volume  of  POSIX.1‐2017
       defers to the ISO C standard.

       These functions shall compute the square root of their argument x, √x.

       An  application  wishing to check for error situations should set errno
       to zero and  call  feclearexcept(FE_ALL_EXCEPT)  before  calling  these
       functions. On return, if errno is non-zero or fetestexcept(FE_INVALID |
       FE_DIVBYZERO | FE_OVERFLOW | FE_UNDERFLOW) is non-zero,  an  error  has
       occurred.

RETURN VALUE
       Upon  successful  completion,  these  functions shall return the square
       root of x.

       For finite values of x < -0, a domain error shall occur, and  either  a
       NaN  (if  supported),  or  an implementation-defined value shall be re‐
       turned.

       If x is NaN, a NaN shall be returned.

       If x is ±0 or +Inf, x shall be returned.

       If x is -Inf, a domain error shall occur, and a NaN shall be returned.

ERRORS
       These functions shall fail if:

       Domain Error
                   The finite value of x is < -0, or x is -Inf.

                   If the integer expression (math_errhandling  &  MATH_ERRNO)
                   is non-zero, then errno shall be set to [EDOM].  If the in‐
                   teger expression  (math_errhandling  &  MATH_ERREXCEPT)  is
                   non-zero,  then  the invalid floating-point exception shall
                   be raised.

       The following sections are informative.

EXAMPLES
   Taking the Square Root of 9.0
           #include <math.h>
           ...
           double x = 9.0;
           double result;
           ...
           result = sqrt(x);

APPLICATION USAGE
       On error, the expressions (math_errhandling & MATH_ERRNO) and (math_er‐
       rhandling & MATH_ERREXCEPT) are independent of each other, but at least
       one of them must be non-zero.

RATIONALE
       None.

FUTURE DIRECTIONS
       None.
