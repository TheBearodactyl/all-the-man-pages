DESCRIPTION
RETURN VALUE
       Returns an xcb_shm_get_image_cookie_t. Errors have to be handled when calling the reply function xcb_shm_get_image_reply.

       If you want to handle errors in the event loop instead, use xcb_shm_get_image_unchecked. See xcb-requests(3) for details.

ERRORS
       This request does never generate any errors.
