NAME
       curs_legacy - get curses cursor and window coordinates, attributes

SYNOPSIS
       #include <curses.h>

       int getattrs(const WINDOW *win);

       int getbegx(const WINDOW *win);
       int getbegy(const WINDOW *win);

       int getcurx(const WINDOW *win);
       int getcury(const WINDOW *win);

       int getmaxx(const WINDOW *win);
       int getmaxy(const WINDOW *win);

       int getparx(const WINDOW *win);
       int getpary(const WINDOW *win);

DESCRIPTION
       These legacy functions are simpler to use than the X/Open Curses functions:

       •   The getattrs function returns the same attribute data as wattr_get.

           However, getattrs returns an integer (actually a chtype), while wattr_get returns the current color pair in a separate parameter.  In the wide-character library configuration, color pairs may
           not fit into a chtype, so wattr_get is the only way to obtain the color information.

           Because getattrs returns the attributes in a single parameter, it would not be possible for an application to distinguish that from ERR (a -1).  If the window parameter is null, getattrs  re‐
           turns A_NORMAL (zero).

       •   The getbegy and getbegx functions return the same data as getbegyx.

       •   The getcury and getcurx functions return the same data as getyx.

       •   The getmaxy and getmaxx functions return the same data as getmaxyx.

       •   The getpary and getparx functions return the same data as getparyx.

RETURN VALUE
       Except as noted, these functions return an integer, or ERR if the window parameter is null.

NOTES
       All  of  these interfaces are provided as macros and functions.  The macros are suppressed (and only the functions provided) when NCURSES_OPAQUE is defined.  The standard forms such as getyx must
       be implemented as macros, and (in this implementation) are defined in terms of the functions described here, to avoid reliance on internal details of the WINDOW structure.

PORTABILITY
       These functions were supported on Version 7, BSD or System V implementations.  None of those implementations checked the window parameter.

       The getattrs function and macro are defined to return a (signed) integer for compatibility with those implementations although an unsigned type would have been more appropriate.
