NAME
       gnutls_privkey_verify_seed - API function

SYNOPSIS
       #include <gnutls/abstract.h>

       int gnutls_privkey_verify_seed(gnutls_privkey_t key, gnutls_digest_algorithm_t digest, const void * seed, size_t seed_size);

ARGUMENTS
       gnutls_privkey_t key
                   should contain a gnutls_privkey_t type

       gnutls_digest_algorithm_t digest
                   it contains the digest algorithm used for key generation (if applicable)

       const void * seed
                   the seed of the key to be checked with

       size_t seed_size
                   holds the size of  seed

DESCRIPTION
       This function will verify that the given private key was generated from the provided seed.

RETURNS
       In case of a verification failure GNUTLS_E_PRIVKEY_VERIFICATION_ERROR is returned, and zero or positive code on success.

SINCE
       3.5.0
