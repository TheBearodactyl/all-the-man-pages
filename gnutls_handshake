NAME
       gnutls_handshake - API function

SYNOPSIS
       #include <gnutls/gnutls.h>

       int gnutls_handshake(gnutls_session_t session);

ARGUMENTS
       gnutls_session_t session
                   is a gnutls_session_t type.

DESCRIPTION
       This function performs the handshake of the TLS/SSL protocol, and initializes the TLS session parameters.

       The  non-fatal errors expected by this function are: GNUTLS_E_INTERRUPTED, GNUTLS_E_AGAIN, GNUTLS_E_WARNING_ALERT_RECEIVED. When this function is called for re-handshake under TLS 1.2 or earlier,
       the non-fatal error code GNUTLS_E_GOT_APPLICATION_DATA may also be returned.

       The former two interrupt the handshake procedure due to the transport layer being interrupted, and the latter because of a "warning" alert that was sent by the peer (it is always a good  idea  to
       check  any received alerts). On these non-fatal errors call this function again, until it returns 0; cf.  gnutls_record_get_direction() and gnutls_error_is_fatal(). In DTLS sessions the non-fatal
       error GNUTLS_E_LARGE_PACKET is also possible, and indicates that the MTU should be adjusted.

       When this function is called by a server after a rehandshake request under TLS 1.2 or earlier the GNUTLS_E_GOT_APPLICATION_DATA error code indicates that some data were pending prior to peer ini‐
       tiating  the  handshake.   Under  TLS  1.3  this  function  when  called after a successful handshake, is a no-op and always succeeds in server side; in client side this function is equivalent to
       gnutls_session_key_update() with GNUTLS_KU_PEER flag.

       This function handles both full and abbreviated TLS handshakes (resumption).  For abbreviated handshakes, in client side, the gnutls_session_set_data() should be called prior to this function  to
       set parameters from a previous session.  In server side, resumption is handled by either setting a DB back-end, or setting up keys for session tickets.

RETURNS
       GNUTLS_E_SUCCESS on a successful handshake, otherwise a negative error code.
