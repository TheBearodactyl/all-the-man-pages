NAME
       gnutls_pkcs11_obj_import_url - API function

SYNOPSIS
       #include <gnutls/pkcs11.h>

       int gnutls_pkcs11_obj_import_url(gnutls_pkcs11_obj_t obj, const char * url, unsigned int flags);

ARGUMENTS
       gnutls_pkcs11_obj_t obj
                   The structure to store the object

       const char * url
                   a PKCS 11 url identifying the key

       unsigned int flags
                   Or sequence of GNUTLS_PKCS11_OBJ_* flags

DESCRIPTION
       This  function  will  "import"  a  PKCS  11  URL  identifying  an object (e.g. certificate) to the gnutls_pkcs11_obj_t type. This does not involve any parsing (such as X.509 or OpenPGP) since the
       gnutls_pkcs11_obj_t is format agnostic. Only data are transferred.

       If the flag GNUTLS_PKCS11_OBJ_FLAG_OVERWRITE_TRUSTMOD_EXT is specified any certificate read, will have its extensions overwritten by any stapled extensions in the trust module.

RETURNS
       On success, GNUTLS_E_SUCCESS (0) is returned, otherwise a negative error value.

SINCE
       2.12.0
