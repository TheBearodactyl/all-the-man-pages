NAME
       fgetwc, getwc - read a wide character from a FILE stream

LIBRARY
       Standard C library (libc, -lc)

SYNOPSIS
       #include <stdio.h>
       #include <wchar.h>

       wint_t fgetwc(FILE *stream);
       wint_t getwc(FILE *stream);

DESCRIPTION
       The  fgetwc() function is the wide-character equivalent of the fgetc(3) function.  It reads a wide character from stream and returns it.  If the end of stream is reached, or if ferror(stream) be‐
       comes true, it returns WEOF.  If a wide-character conversion error occurs, it sets errno to EILSEQ and returns WEOF.

       The getwc() function or macro functions identically to fgetwc().  It may be implemented as a macro, and may evaluate its argument more than once.  There is no reason ever to use it.

       For nonlocking counterparts, see unlocked_stdio(3).

RETURN VALUE
       On success, fgetwc() returns the next wide-character from the stream.  Otherwise, WEOF is returned, and errno is set to indicate the error.

ERRORS
       Apart from the usual ones, there is

       EILSEQ The data obtained from the input stream does not form a valid character.

STANDARDS

HISTORY
       POSIX.1-2001, C99.

NOTES
       The behavior of fgetwc() depends on the LC_CTYPE category of the current locale.

       In the absence of additional information passed to the fopen(3) call, it is reasonable to expect that fgetwc() will actually read a multibyte sequence from the stream and then  convert  it  to  a
       wide character.

PROLOG

       the interface may not be implemented on Linux.

NAME
       getwc — get a wide character from a stream

SYNOPSIS
       #include <stdio.h>
       #include <wchar.h>

       wint_t getwc(FILE *stream);

DESCRIPTION
       The functionality described on this reference page is aligned with the ISO C standard. Any conflict between the requirements described here and the ISO C standard is unintentional. This volume of
       POSIX.1‐2017 defers to the ISO C standard.

       The  getwc()  function shall be equivalent to fgetwc(), except that if it is implemented as a macro it may evaluate stream more than once, so the argument should never be an expression with side-
       effects.

RETURN VALUE
       Refer to fgetwc().

ERRORS
       Refer to fgetwc().

       The following sections are informative.

EXAMPLES
       None.

APPLICATION USAGE
       Since it may be implemented as a macro, getwc() may treat incorrectly a stream argument with side-effects. In particular, getwc(*f++) does not necessarily work as  expected.   Therefore,  use  of
       this function is not recommended; fgetwc() should be used instead.

RATIONALE
       None.

FUTURE DIRECTIONS
       None.
