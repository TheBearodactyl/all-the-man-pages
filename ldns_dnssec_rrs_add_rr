NAME
       ldns_dnssec_rrs_new, ldns_dnssec_rrs_free, ldns_dnssec_rrs_add_rr, ldns_dnssec_rrs_print - functions for ldns_dnssecrrs

SYNOPSIS
       #include <stdint.h>
       #include <stdbool.h>

       #include <ldns/ldns.h>

        ldns_dnssec_rrs_new();

       void ldns_dnssec_rrs_free(ldns_dnssec_rrs *rrs);

       ldns_status ldns_dnssec_rrs_add_rr(ldns_dnssec_rrs *rrs, ldns_rr *rr);

       void ldns_dnssec_rrs_print(FILE *out, const ldns_dnssec_rrs *rrs);

DESCRIPTION
       ldns_dnssec_rrs_new()

       ldns_dnssec_rrs_free() Frees the list of rrs, but *not* the individual ldns_rr records contained in the list

              rrs: the data structure to free

       ldns_dnssec_rrs_add_rr() Adds an RR to the list of RRs. The list will remain ordered.  If an equal RR already exists, this RR will not be added.

              rrs: the list to add to
              rr: the RR to add
              Returns LDNS_STATUS_OK on success

       ldns_dnssec_rrs_print() Prints the given rrs to the file descriptor

              out: the file descriptor to print to
              rrs: the list of RRs to print
