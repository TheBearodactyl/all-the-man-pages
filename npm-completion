NAME
       npm-completion - Tab Completion for npm

   Synopsis
         npm completion

       Note: This command is unaware of workspaces.

   Description
       Enables tab-completion in all npm commands.

       The synopsis above loads the completions into your current shell.  Adding it to your ~/.bashrc or ~/.zshrc will make the completions available everywhere:

         npm completion >> ~/.bashrc
         npm completion >> ~/.zshrc

       You  may  of  course  also pipe the output of npm completion to a file such as /usr/local/etc/bash_completion.d/npm or /etc/bash_completion.d/npm if you have a system that will read that file for
       you.

       When COMP_CWORD, COMP_LINE, and COMP_POINT are defined in the environment, npm completion acts in "plumbing mode", and outputs completions based on the arguments.
