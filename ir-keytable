NAME
       ir-keytable - a swiss-knife tool to handle Remote Controllers.

SYNOPSIS
       ir-keytable [OPTION]...

DESCRIPTION
       ir-keytable is a tool that lists Remote Controller devices, loads rc keymaps, tests events, and adjusts other Remote Controller options.

       Rather than loading a rc keymap, it is also possible to set protocol decoders and set rc scancode to keycode mappings directly.

       Note: You need to have read permissions on /dev/input for most of the options to work.

OPTIONS
       -a, --auto-load=CFGFILE
              Auto-load keymaps, based on a configuration file. Only works with --sysdev.

       -c, --clear
              Clears the scancode to keycode mappings.

       -D, --delay=DELAY
              Sets the delay before repeating a keystroke.

       -k, --set-key=SCANKEY
              Set scancode to keycode mapping.

       -p, --protocol=PROTOCOL
              Comma separated list of kernel protocols or BPF protocol to enable. All other protocols are disabled.

       -e, --parameter=PARAMETER
              Comma separated list of parameters for the BPF protocol.

       -P, --period=PERIOD
              Sets the period to repeat a keystroke.

       -r, --read
              Read and show the current scancode to keycode mapping.

       -s, --sysdev=SYSDEV
              rc device to control, defaults to rc0 if not specified.

       -t, --test
              test if the rc device is generating events

       -v, --verbose
              Enables debug messages.

       -w, --write=KEYMAP
              Reads the protocols and scancode to keycode mapping from the KEYMAP file, and enables those on the rc device.

       -?, --help
              Prints the help message

       --usage
              Give a short usage message

       -V, --version
              print the v4l2-utils version

       Mandatory or optional arguments to long options are also mandatory or optional for any corresponding short options. Options can be combined together.

   The options arguments are:
       SYSDEV the rc device as found at /sys/class/rc

       KEYMAP a toml keymap file with a list of protocols and scancodes to keycode mappings.  The format is described in rc_keymap(5).

       SCANKEY
              a set of scancode1=keycode1,scancode2=keycode2.. value pairs

       PROTOCOL
              Comma  separated  list  of kernel protocols to be enabled (case insensitive).  Supported kernel protocols are: nec, rc-5, rc-6, jvc, sony, sanyo, rc-5-sz, sharp, mce-kbd, xmp, imon, rc-mm,
              other, all. It can also be a BPF protocol, e.g. manchester, pulse_distance, pulse_length.  If it does not match any of these, it is taken to be the path of BPF decoder to be loaded.

       PARAMETERS
              Comma separated list of parameters for the BPF protocol being loaded. They have the format of name=value, where value is an number.

       DELAY  Delay before repeating a keystroke

       PERIOD Period to repeat a keystroke

       CFGFILE
              configuration file that associates a driver/keymap name with a keymap file

EXIT STATUS
       On success, it returns 0. Otherwise, it will return the error code.

EXAMPLES
       To list all connected Remote Controller devices:
            ir-keytable

       To clean the keycode mapping and use a newer one:
            ir-keytable -c -w /etc/rc_keymaps/nec_terratec_cinergy_xs.toml

       To append more codes to the existing table:
            ir-keytable -w /etc/rc_keymaps/nec_terratec_cinergy_xs.toml

       To read the current scancode to keycode mapping on the second remote controller:
            ir-keytable -s rc1 -r

       To enable NEC protocol and load a BPF protocol, with a parameter for the BPF protocol:
            ir-keytable -p nec,pulse_distance -e pulse_header=9000

       If you do not know what protocol a remote uses, it can be helpful to first try with all kernel decoders enabled. The decoded protocol and scancodes will be displayed in the output:
            ir-keytable -c -p all -t
