       •   ALPM_CAPABILITY_SIGNATURES

       Capabilities are case-insensitive and may omit the leading

       capability will printed, one per line, followed by a one or zero to
       indicate that the feature is enabled or disabled, respectively.  If any
       given capabilities are disabled paccapability will exit with a non-zero
       value.
