NAME
       ts_open_restricted - use a custom function for opening the touchscreen's input device file

SYNOPSIS
       #include <tslib.h>

       int (*ts_open_restricted)(const char *path, int flags, void *user_data);

DESCRIPTION
       ts_open_restricted() is useful if libts should not be run as root. If such a function is implemented by the user and assigned to the ts_open_restricted pointer, it will be called by ts_open() in‚Äê
       stead of the open() system call directly.

       It should open the input device at path with flags while user_data is currently unused.

RETURN VALUE
       the touchscreen input device' file descriptor
