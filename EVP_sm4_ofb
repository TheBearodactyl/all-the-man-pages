NAME
       EVP_sm4_cbc, EVP_sm4_ecb, EVP_sm4_cfb, EVP_sm4_cfb128, EVP_sm4_ofb, EVP_sm4_ctr - EVP SM4 cipher

SYNOPSIS
        #include <openssl/evp.h>

        const EVP_CIPHER *EVP_sm4_cbc(void);
        const EVP_CIPHER *EVP_sm4_ecb(void);
        const EVP_CIPHER *EVP_sm4_cfb(void);
        const EVP_CIPHER *EVP_sm4_cfb128(void);
        const EVP_CIPHER *EVP_sm4_ofb(void);
        const EVP_CIPHER *EVP_sm4_ctr(void);

DESCRIPTION
       The SM4 blockcipher (GB/T 32907-2016) for EVP.

       All modes below use a key length of 128 bits and acts on blocks of 128 bits.

       EVP_sm4_cbc(), EVP_sm4_ecb(), EVP_sm4_cfb(), EVP_sm4_cfb128(), EVP_sm4_ofb(), EVP_sm4_ctr()
           The SM4 blockcipher with a 128-bit key in CBC, ECB, CFB, OFB and CTR modes respectively.

RETURN VALUES
       These functions return a EVP_CIPHER structure that contains the implementation of the symmetric cipher. See EVP_CIPHER_meth_new(3) for details of the EVP_CIPHER structure.
