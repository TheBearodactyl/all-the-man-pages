NAME
       XSetClipOrigin, XSetClipMask, XSetClipRectangles - GC convenience routines

SYNTAX
       int XSetClipOrigin(Display *display, GC gc, int clip_x_origin, int clip_y_origin);

       int XSetClipMask(Display *display, GC gc, Pixmap pixmap);

       int XSetClipRectangles(Display *display, GC gc, int clip_x_origin, int clip_y_origin, XRectangle rectangles[], int n, int ordering);

ARGUMENTS
       display   Specifies the connection to the X server.

       clip_x_origin
       clip_y_origin
                 Specify the x and y coordinates of the clip-mask origin.

       gc        Specifies the GC.

       n         Specifies the number of rectangles.

       ordering  Specifies the ordering relations on the rectangles.  You can pass Unsorted, YSorted, YXSorted, or YXBanded.

       pixmap    Specifies the pixmap or None.

       rectangles
                 Specifies an array of rectangles that define the clip-mask.

DESCRIPTION
       The XSetClipOrigin function sets the clip origin in the specified GC.  The clip-mask origin is interpreted relative to the origin of whatever destination drawable is specified in the graphics re‐
       quest.

       XSetClipOrigin can generate BadAlloc and BadGC errors.

       The XSetClipMask function sets the clip-mask in the specified GC to the specified pixmap.  If the clip-mask is set to None, the pixels are are always drawn (regardless of the clip-origin).

       XSetClipMask can generate BadAlloc, BadGC, BadMatch, and BadValue errors.

       The XSetClipRectangles function changes the clip-mask in the specified GC to the specified list of rectangles and sets the clip origin.  The output is clipped to remain contained within the  rec‐
       tangles.   The  clip-origin  is  interpreted relative to the origin of whatever destination drawable is specified in a graphics request.  The rectangle coordinates are interpreted relative to the
       clip-origin.  The rectangles should be nonintersecting, or the graphics results will be undefined.  Note that the list of rectangles can be empty, which effectively disables output.  This is  the
       opposite of passing None as the clip-mask in XCreateGC, XChangeGC, and XSetClipMask.

       If known by the client, ordering relations on the rectangles can be specified with the ordering argument.  This may provide faster operation by the server.  If an incorrect ordering is specified,
       the X server may generate a BadMatch error, but it is not required to do so.  If no error is generated, the graphics results are undefined.  Unsorted means the rectangles are in arbitrary  order.
       YSorted  means  that the rectangles are nondecreasing in their Y origin.  YXSorted additionally constrains YSorted order in that all rectangles with an equal Y origin are nondecreasing in their X
       origin.  YXBanded additionally constrains YXSorted by requiring that, for every possible Y scanline, all rectangles that include that scanline have an identical Y origins and Y extents.

       XSetClipRectangles can generate BadAlloc, BadGC, BadMatch, and BadValue errors.

DIAGNOSTICS
       BadAlloc  The server failed to allocate the requested resource or server memory.

       BadGC     A value for a GContext argument does not name a defined GContext.

       BadMatch  Some argument or pair of arguments has the correct type and range but fails to match in some other way required by the request.

       BadValue  Some numeric value falls outside the range of values accepted by the request.  Unless a specific range is specified for an argument, the full range defined by the argument's type is ac‐
                 cepted.  Any argument defined as a set of alternatives can generate this error.
