NAME
       gnutls_register_custom_url - API function

SYNOPSIS
       #include <gnutls/urls.h>

       int gnutls_register_custom_url(const gnutls_custom_url_st * st);

ARGUMENTS
       const gnutls_custom_url_st * st
                   A gnutls_custom_url_st structure

DESCRIPTION
       Register  a  custom URL. This will affect the following functions: gnutls_url_is_supported(), gnutls_privkey_import_url(), gnutls_pubkey_import_url, gnutls_x509_crt_import_url() and all functions
       that depend on them, e.g., gnutls_certificate_set_x509_key_file2().

       The provided structure and callback functions must be valid throughout the lifetime of the process. The registration of an existing URL type will fail with GNUTLS_E_INVALID_REQUEST. Since  GnuTLS
       3.5.0 this function can be used to override the builtin URLs.

       This function is not thread safe.

RETURNS
       returns zero if the given structure was imported or a negative value otherwise.

SINCE
       3.4.0
