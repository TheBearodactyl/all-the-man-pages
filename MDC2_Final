NAME
       MDC2, MDC2_Init, MDC2_Update, MDC2_Final - MDC2 hash function

SYNOPSIS
        #include <openssl/mdc2.h>

       The following functions have been deprecated since OpenSSL 3.0, and can be hidden entirely by defining OPENSSL_API_COMPAT with a suitable version value, see openssl_user_macros(7):

        unsigned char *MDC2(const unsigned char *d, unsigned long n,
                            unsigned char *md);

        int MDC2_Init(MDC2_CTX *c);
        int MDC2_Update(MDC2_CTX *c, const unsigned char *data,
                        unsigned long len);
        int MDC2_Final(unsigned char *md, MDC2_CTX *c);

DESCRIPTION
       All of the functions described on this page are deprecated.  Applications should instead use EVP_DigestInit_ex(3), EVP_DigestUpdate(3) and EVP_DigestFinal_ex(3).

       MDC2 is a method to construct hash functions with 128 bit output from block ciphers.  These functions are an implementation of MDC2 with DES.

       MDC2() computes the MDC2 message digest of the n bytes at d and places it in md (which must have space for MDC2_DIGEST_LENGTH == 16 bytes of output). If md is NULL, the digest is placed in a
       static array.

       The following functions may be used if the message is not completely stored in memory:

       MDC2_Init() initializes a MDC2_CTX structure.

       MDC2_Update() can be called repeatedly with chunks of the message to be hashed (len bytes at data).

       MDC2_Final() places the message digest in md, which must have space for MDC2_DIGEST_LENGTH == 16 bytes of output, and erases the MDC2_CTX.

       Applications should use the higher level functions EVP_DigestInit(3) etc. instead of calling the hash functions directly.

RETURN VALUES
       MDC2() returns a pointer to the hash value.

       MDC2_Init(), MDC2_Update() and MDC2_Final() return 1 for success, 0 otherwise.

CONFORMING TO
       ISO/IEC 10118-2:2000 Hash-Function 2, with DES as the underlying block cipher.

HISTORY
       All of these functions were deprecated in OpenSSL 3.0.
