NAME
       null, zero - data sink

DESCRIPTION
       Data written to the /dev/null and /dev/zero special files is discarded.

       Reads from /dev/null always return end of file (i.e., read(2) returns 0), whereas reads from /dev/zero always return bytes containing zero ('\0' characters).

       These devices are typically created by:

           mknod -m 666 /dev/null c 1 3
           mknod -m 666 /dev/zero c 1 5
           chown root:root /dev/null /dev/zero

FILES
       /dev/null
       /dev/zero

NOTES
       If these devices are not writable and readable for all users, many programs will act strangely.

       Since Linux 2.6.31, reads from /dev/zero are interruptible by signals.  (This change was made to help with bad latencies for large reads from /dev/zero.)

NAME
       NULL - null pointer constant

LIBRARY
       Standard C library (libc)

SYNOPSIS
       #include <stddef.h>

       #define NULL  ((void *) 0)

DESCRIPTION
       NULL represents a null pointer constant, that is, a pointer that does not point to anything.

CONFORMING TO
       C99 and later; POSIX.1-2001 and later.

NOTES
       The following headers also provide NULL: <locale.h>, <stdio.h>, <stdlib.h>, <string.h>, <time.h>, <unistd.h>, and <wchar.h>.

CAVEATS
       It is undefined behavior to dereference a null pointer, and that usually causes a segmentation fault in practice.

       It is also undefined behavior to perform pointer arithmetic on it.

       NULL - NULL is undefined behavior, according to ISO C, but is defined to be 0 in C++.

       To avoid confusing human readers of the code, do not compare pointer variables to 0, and do not assign 0 to them.  Instead, always use NULL.

       NULL shouldn't be confused with NUL, which is an ascii(7) character, represented in C as '\0'.

BUGS
       When  it is necessary to set a pointer variable to a null pointer, it is not enough to use memset(3) to zero the pointer (this is usually done when zeroing a struct that contains pointers), since
       ISO C and POSIX don't guarantee that a bit pattern of all 0s represent a null pointer.  See the EXAMPLES section in getaddrinfo(3) for an example program that does this correctly.
