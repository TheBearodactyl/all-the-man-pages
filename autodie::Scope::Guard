NAME
       autodie::Scope::Guard - Wrapper class for calling subs at end of scope

SYNOPSIS
           use autodie::Scope::Guard;
           $^H{'my-key'} = autodie::Scope::Guard->new(sub {
               print "Hallo world\n";
           });

DESCRIPTION
       This class is used to bless perl subs so that they are invoked when they are destroyed.  This is mostly useful for ensuring the code is invoked at end of scope.  This module is not a part of
       autodie's public API.

       This module is directly inspired by chocolateboy's excellent Scope::Guard module.

   Methods
       new

         my $hook = autodie::Scope::Guard->new(sub {});

       Creates a new "autodie::Scope::Guard", which will invoke the given sub once it goes out of scope (i.e. its DESTROY handler is called).
