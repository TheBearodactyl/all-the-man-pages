NAME
       Test2::EventFacet::Amnesty - Facet for assertion amnesty.

DESCRIPTION
       This package represents what is expected in units of amnesty.

NOTES
       This facet appears in a list instead of being a single item.

FIELDS
       $string = $amnesty->{details}
       $string = $amnesty->details()
           Human readable explanation of why amnesty was granted.

           Example: Not implemented yet, will fix

       $short_string = $amnesty->{tag}
       $short_string = $amnesty->tag()
           Short string (usually 10 characters or less, not enforced, but may be truncated by renderers) categorizing the amnesty.

       $bool = $amnesty->{inherited}
       $bool = $amnesty->inherited()
           This will be true if the amnesty was granted to a parent event and inherited by this event, which is a child, such as an assertion within a subtest that is marked todo.
