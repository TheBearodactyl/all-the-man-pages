NAME
       xcb_free_pixmap - Destroys a pixmap

SYNOPSIS
       #include <xcb/xproto.h>

   Request function
       xcb_void_cookie_t xcb_free_pixmap(xcb_connection_t *conn, xcb_pixmap_t pixmap);

REQUEST ARGUMENTS
       conn      The XCB connection to X11.

       pixmap    The pixmap to destroy.

DESCRIPTION
       Deletes the association between the pixmap ID and the pixmap. The pixmap storage will be freed when there are no more references to it.

RETURN VALUE
       Returns an xcb_void_cookie_t. Errors (if any) have to be handled in the event loop.

       If you want to handle errors directly with xcb_request_check instead, use xcb_free_pixmap_checked. See xcb-requests(3) for details.

ERRORS
       xcb_pixmap_error_t
                 The specified pixmap does not exist.
