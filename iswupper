NAME
       iswupper - test for uppercase wide character

LIBRARY
       Standard C library (libc, -lc)

SYNOPSIS
       #include <wctype.h>

       int iswupper(wint_t wc);

DESCRIPTION
       The iswupper() function is the wide-character equivalent of the isupper(3) function.  It tests whether wc is a wide character belonging to the wide-character class "upper".

       The  wide-character  class "upper" is a subclass of the wide-character class "alpha", and therefore also a subclass of the wide-character class "alnum", of the wide-character class "graph" and of
       the wide-character class "print".

       Being a subclass of the wide-character class "print", the wide-character class "upper" is disjoint from the wide-character class "cntrl".

       Being a subclass of the wide-character class "graph", the wide-character class "upper" is disjoint from the wide-character class "space" and its subclass "blank".

       Being a subclass of the wide-character class "alnum", the wide-character class "upper" is disjoint from the wide-character class "punct".

       Being a subclass of the wide-character class "alpha", the wide-character class "upper" is disjoint from the wide-character class "digit".

       The wide-character class "upper" contains at least those characters wc which are equal to towupper(wc) and different from towlower(wc).

       The wide-character class "upper" always contains at least the letters 'A' to 'Z'.

RETURN VALUE
       The iswupper() function returns nonzero if wc is a wide character belonging to the wide-character class "upper".  Otherwise, it returns zero.

STANDARDS
       C11, POSIX.1-2008.

HISTORY
       POSIX.1-2001, C99.

NOTES
       The behavior of iswupper() depends on the LC_CTYPE category of the current locale.

       This function is not very appropriate for dealing with Unicode characters, because Unicode knows about three cases: upper, lower, and title case.

PROLOG

NAME
       iswupper, iswupper_l — test for an uppercase letter wide-character code

SYNOPSIS
       #include <wctype.h>

       int iswupper(wint_t wc);
       int iswupper_l(wint_t wc, locale_t locale);

DESCRIPTION
       For iswupper(): The functionality described on this reference page is aligned with the ISO C standard. Any conflict between the requirements described here and  the  ISO C  standard  is  uninten‐
       tional. This volume of POSIX.1‐2017 defers to the ISO C standard.

       The iswupper() and iswupper_l() functions shall test whether wc is a wide-character code representing a character of class upper in the current locale, or in the locale represented by locale, re‐
       spectively; see the Base Definitions volume of POSIX.1‐2017, Chapter 7, Locale.

       The wc argument is a wint_t, the value of which the application shall ensure is a wide-character code corresponding to a valid character in the locale used by the function, or equal to the  value
       of the macro WEOF. If the argument has any other value, the behavior is undefined.

       The behavior is undefined if the locale argument to iswupper_l() is the special locale object LC_GLOBAL_LOCALE or is not a valid locale object handle.

RETURN VALUE
       The iswupper() and iswupper_l() functions shall return non-zero if wc is an uppercase letter wide-character code; otherwise, they shall return 0.

ERRORS
       No errors are defined.

       The following sections are informative.

EXAMPLES
       None.

APPLICATION USAGE
       To  ensure applications portability, especially across natural languages, only these functions and the functions in the reference pages listed in the SEE ALSO section should be used for character
       classification.

RATIONALE
       None.

FUTURE DIRECTIONS
       None.
