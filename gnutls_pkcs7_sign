NAME
       gnutls_pkcs7_sign - API function

SYNOPSIS
       #include <gnutls/pkcs7.h>

       int  gnutls_pkcs7_sign(gnutls_pkcs7_t  pkcs7,  gnutls_x509_crt_t  signer,  gnutls_privkey_t  signer_key,  const  gnutls_datum_t * data, gnutls_pkcs7_attrs_t signed_attrs, gnutls_pkcs7_attrs_t un‐
       signed_attrs, gnutls_digest_algorithm_t dig, unsigned flags);

ARGUMENTS
       gnutls_pkcs7_t pkcs7
                   should contain a gnutls_pkcs7_t type

       gnutls_x509_crt_t signer
                   the certificate to sign the structure

       gnutls_privkey_t signer_key
                   the key to sign the structure

       const gnutls_datum_t * data
                   The data to be signed or NULL if the data are already embedded

       gnutls_pkcs7_attrs_t signed_attrs
                   Any additional attributes to be included in the signed ones (or NULL)

       gnutls_pkcs7_attrs_t unsigned_attrs
                   Any additional attributes to be included in the unsigned ones (or NULL)

       gnutls_digest_algorithm_t dig
                   The digest algorithm to use for signing

       unsigned flags
                   Should be zero or one of GNUTLS_PKCS7 flags

DESCRIPTION
       This function will add a signature in the provided PKCS 7 structure for the provided data. Multiple signatures can be made with different signers.

       The available flags are: GNUTLS_PKCS7_EMBED_DATA, GNUTLS_PKCS7_INCLUDE_TIME, GNUTLS_PKCS7_INCLUDE_CERT, and GNUTLS_PKCS7_WRITE_SPKI. They are explained in the gnutls_pkcs7_sign_flags definition.

RETURNS
       On success, GNUTLS_E_SUCCESS (0) is returned, otherwise a negative error value.
