NAME
       Fapi_GetPlatformCertificates - Fapi_GetPlatformCertificates

SYNOPSIS
   Functions
       TSS2_RC Fapi_GetPlatformCertificates (FAPI_CONTEXT *context, uint8_t **certificates, size_t *certificatesSize)
       TSS2_RC Fapi_GetPlatformCertificates_Async (FAPI_CONTEXT *context)
       TSS2_RC Fapi_GetPlatformCertificates_Finish (FAPI_CONTEXT *context, uint8_t **certificates, size_t *certificatesSize)

Detailed Description
       FAPI functions to invoke GetPlatformCertificates either as one-call or in an asynchronous manner.

Function Documentation
   Fapi_GetPlatformCertificates (FAPI_CONTEXT * context, uint8_t ** certificates, size_t * certificatesSize)
       One-Call function for Fapi_GetPlatformCertificates

       Platform certificates for TPM 2.0 can consist not only of a single certificate but a series of so-called delta certificates. This function returns the set of Platform certificates concatenated in
       a continuous buffer.

       Parameters
           context The FAPI_CONTEXT
           certificates The platform certificates
           certificatesSize The size of the buffer with the certificates. May be NULL

       Return values
           TSS2_RC_SUCCESS if the function call was a success.
           TSS2_FAPI_RC_BAD_REFERENCE if context or certificates is NULL.
           TSS2_FAPI_RC_BAD_CONTEXT if context corruption is detected.
           TSS2_FAPI_RC_BAD_SEQUENCE if the context has an asynchronous operation already pending.
           TSS2_FAPI_RC_IO_ERROR if the data cannot be saved.
           TSS2_FAPI_RC_MEMORY if the FAPI cannot allocate enough memory for internal operations or return parameters.
           TSS2_FAPI_RC_NO_TPM if FAPI was initialized in no-TPM-mode via its config file.
           TSS2_FAPI_RC_NO_CERT if an error did occur during certificate downloading.
           TSS2_FAPI_RC_TRY_AGAIN if an I/O operation is not finished yet and this function needs to be called again.
           TSS2_FAPI_RC_AUTHORIZATION_UNKNOWN if a required authorization callback is not set.
           TSS2_FAPI_RC_AUTHORIZATION_FAILED if the authorization attempt fails.
           TSS2_FAPI_RC_GENERAL_FAILURE if an internal error occurred.
           TSS2_FAPI_RC_POLICY_UNKNOWN if policy search for a certain policy digest was not successful.
           TSS2_ESYS_RC_* possible error codes of ESAPI.
           TSS2_FAPI_RC_NOT_PROVISIONED FAPI was not provisioned.
           TSS2_FAPI_RC_KEY_NOT_FOUND if a key was not found.
           TSS2_FAPI_RC_BAD_PATH if the path is used in inappropriate context or contains illegal characters.
           TSS2_FAPI_RC_BAD_VALUE if an invalid value was passed into the function.
           TSS2_FAPI_RC_PATH_NOT_FOUND if a FAPI object path was not found during authorization.

   Fapi_GetPlatformCertificates_Async (FAPI_CONTEXT * context)
       Asynchronous function for Fapi_GetPlatformCertificates

       Platform certificates for TPM 2.0 can consist not only of a single certificate but a series of so-called delta certificates. This function returns the set of Platform certificates concatenated in
       a continuous buffer.

       Call Fapi_GetPlatformCertificates_Finish to finish the execution of this command.

       Parameters
           context The FAPI_CONTEXT

       Return values
           TSS2_RC_SUCCESS if the function call was a success.
           TSS2_FAPI_RC_BAD_REFERENCE if context is NULL.
           TSS2_FAPI_RC_BAD_CONTEXT if context corruption is detected.
           TSS2_FAPI_RC_BAD_SEQUENCE if the context has an asynchronous operation already pending.
           TSS2_FAPI_RC_IO_ERROR if the data cannot be saved.
           TSS2_FAPI_RC_MEMORY if the FAPI cannot allocate enough memory for internal operations or return parameters.
           TSS2_FAPI_RC_NO_TPM if FAPI was initialized in no-TPM-mode via its config file.

   Fapi_GetPlatformCertificates_Finish (FAPI_CONTEXT * context, uint8_t ** certificates, size_t * certificatesSize)
       Asynchronous finish function for Fapi_GetPlatformCertificates

       This function should be called after a previous Fapi_GetPlatformCertificates_Async.

       Parameters
           context The FAPI_CONTEXT
           certificates The platform certificates
           certificatesSize The size of the buffer with the certificates. May be NULL

       Return values
           TSS2_RC_SUCCESS if the function call was a success.
           TSS2_FAPI_RC_BAD_REFERENCE if context or certificates is NULL.
           TSS2_FAPI_RC_BAD_CONTEXT if context corruption is detected.
           TSS2_FAPI_RC_BAD_SEQUENCE if the context has an asynchronous operation already pending.
           TSS2_FAPI_RC_IO_ERROR if the data cannot be saved.
           TSS2_FAPI_RC_MEMORY if the FAPI cannot allocate enough memory for internal operations or return parameters.
           TSS2_FAPI_RC_TRY_AGAIN if the asynchronous operation is not yet complete. Call this function again later.
           TSS2_FAPI_RC_NO_CERT if an error did occur during certificate downloading.
           TSS2_FAPI_RC_AUTHORIZATION_UNKNOWN if a required authorization callback is not set.
           TSS2_FAPI_RC_AUTHORIZATION_FAILED if the authorization attempt fails.
           TSS2_FAPI_RC_GENERAL_FAILURE if an internal error occurred.
           TSS2_FAPI_RC_POLICY_UNKNOWN if policy search for a certain policy digest was not successful.
           TSS2_ESYS_RC_* possible error codes of ESAPI.
           TSS2_FAPI_RC_NOT_PROVISIONED FAPI was not provisioned.
           TSS2_FAPI_RC_KEY_NOT_FOUND if a key was not found.
           TSS2_FAPI_RC_BAD_PATH if the path is used in inappropriate context or contains illegal characters.
           TSS2_FAPI_RC_BAD_VALUE if an invalid value was passed into the function.
           TSS2_FAPI_RC_PATH_NOT_FOUND if a FAPI object path was not found during authorization.
