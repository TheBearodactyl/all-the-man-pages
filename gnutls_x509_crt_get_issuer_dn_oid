NAME
       gnutls_x509_crt_get_issuer_dn_oid - API function

SYNOPSIS
       #include <gnutls/x509.h>

       int gnutls_x509_crt_get_issuer_dn_oid(gnutls_x509_crt_t cert, unsigned indx, void * oid, size_t * oid_size);

ARGUMENTS
       gnutls_x509_crt_t cert
                   should contain a gnutls_x509_crt_t type

       unsigned indx
                   This specifies which OID to return. Use (0) to get the first one.

       void * oid  a pointer to a buffer to hold the OID (may be null)

       size_t * oid_size
                   initially holds the size of  oid

DESCRIPTION
       This function will extract the OIDs of the name of the Certificate issuer specified by the given index.

       If  oid is null then only the size will be filled. The  oid returned will be null terminated, although  oid_size will not account for the trailing null.

RETURNS
       GNUTLS_E_SHORT_MEMORY_BUFFER  if  the provided buffer is not long enough, and in that case the  buf_size will be updated with the required size. GNUTLS_E_REQUESTED_DATA_NOT_AVAILABLE if there are
       no data in the current index. On success 0 is returned.
