NAME
       CURLOPT_DOH_SSL_VERIFYHOST - verify the host name in the DoH SSL certificate

SYNOPSIS
       #include <curl/curl.h>

       CURLcode curl_easy_setopt(CURL *handle, CURLOPT_DOH_SSL_VERIFYHOST,
                                 long verify);

DESCRIPTION
       Pass a long set to 2L as asking curl to verify the DoH (DNS-over-HTTPS) server's certificate name fields against the host name.

       This option is the DoH equivalent of CURLOPT_SSL_VERIFYHOST(3) and only affects requests to the DoH server.

       When  CURLOPT_DOH_SSL_VERIFYHOST(3) is 2, the SSL certificate provided by the DoH server must indicate that the server name is the same as the server name to which you meant to connect to, or the
       connection fails.

       Curl considers the DoH server the intended one when the Common Name field or a Subject Alternate Name field in the certificate matches the host name in the DoH URL to which you told Curl to  con‐
       nect.

       When the verify value is set to 1L it is treated the same as 2L. However for consistency with the other VERIFYHOST options we suggest use 2 and not 1.

       When the verify value is set to 0L, the connection succeeds regardless of the names used in the certificate. Use that ability with caution!

       See  also  CURLOPT_DOH_SSL_VERIFYPEER(3)  to  verify  the  digital  signature  of  the  DoH  server  certificate.   If libcurl is built against NSS and CURLOPT_DOH_SSL_VERIFYPEER(3) is zero, CUR‐
       LOPT_DOH_SSL_VERIFYHOST(3) is also set to zero and cannot be overridden.

DEFAULT
       2

PROTOCOLS
       DoH

EXAMPLE
       CURL *curl = curl_easy_init();
       if(curl) {
         curl_easy_setopt(curl, CURLOPT_URL, "https://example.com");

         curl_easy_setopt(curl, CURLOPT_DOH_URL, "https://cloudflare-dns.com/dns-query");

         /* Disable host name verification of the DoH server */
         curl_easy_setopt(curl, CURLOPT_DOH_SSL_VERIFYHOST, 0L);

         curl_easy_perform(curl);
       }

AVAILABILITY
       Added in 7.76.0

       If built TLS enabled.

RETURN VALUE
       Returns CURLE_OK if the option is supported, and CURLE_UNKNOWN_OPTION if not.
