NAME
       llvm-tblgen - Target Description to C++ Code for LLVM

SYNOPSIS
       llvm-tblgen [options] [filename]

DESCRIPTION
       llvm-tblgen  is  a program that translates compiler-related target description (.td) files into C++ code and other output formats. Most users of LLVM will not need to use this program. It is used
       only for writing parts of the compiler.

       Please see tblgen - Description to C++ Code for a description of the filename argument and options, including the options common to all *-tblgen programs.
