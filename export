PROLOG
       This  manual  page is part of the POSIX Programmer's Manual.  The Linux implementation of this interface may differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for details of Linux behavior), or
       the interface may not be implemented on Linux.

NAME
       export — set the export attribute for variables

SYNOPSIS
       export name[=word]...

       export -p

DESCRIPTION
       The shell shall give the export attribute to the variables corresponding to the specified names, which shall cause them to be in the environment of subsequently executed commands. If the name  of
       a variable is followed by =word, then the value of that variable shall be set to word.

       The export special built-in shall support the Base Definitions volume of POSIX.1‐2017, Section 12.2, Utility Syntax Guidelines.

       When -p is specified, export shall write to the standard output the names and values of all exported variables, in the following format:

           "export %s=%s\n", <name>, <value>

       if name is set, and:

           "export %s\n", <name>

       if name is unset.

       The shell shall format the output, including the proper use of quoting, so that it is suitable for reinput to the shell as commands that achieve the same exporting results, except:

        1. Read-only variables with values cannot be reset.

        2. Variables  that  were unset at the time they were output need not be reset to the unset state if a value is assigned to the variable between the time the state was saved and the time at which
           the saved output is reinput to the shell.

       When no arguments are given, the results are unspecified.

OPTIONS
       See the DESCRIPTION.

OPERANDS
       See the DESCRIPTION.

STDIN
       Not used.

INPUT FILES
       None.

ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
       None.

ASYNCHRONOUS EVENTS
       Default.

STDOUT
       See the DESCRIPTION.

STDERR S
       The standard error shall be used only for diagnostic messages.

OUTPUT FILES
       None.

EXTENDED DESCRIPTION
       None.

EXIT STATUS
        0    All name operands were successfully exported.

       >0    At least one name could not be exported, or the -p option was specified and an error occurred.

CONSEQUENCES OF ERRORS
       Default.

       The following sections are informative.

APPLICATION USAGE
       Note that, unless X was previously marked readonly, the value of "$?" after:

           export X=$(false)

       will be 0 (because export successfully set X to the empty string) and that execution continues, even if set -e is in effect. In order to detect command substitution failures, a user must separate
       the assignment from the export, as in:

           X=$(false)
           export X

EXAMPLES
       Export PWD and HOME variables:

           export PWD HOME

       Set and export the PATH variable:

           export PATH=/local/bin:$PATH

       Save and restore all exported variables:

           export -p > temp-file
           unset a lot of variables
           ... processing
           . temp-file

RATIONALE
       Some  historical  shells  use  the  no-argument case as the functional equivalent of what is required here with -p.  This feature was left unspecified because it is not historical practice in all
       shells, and some scripts may rely on the now-unspecified results on their implementations. Attempts to specify the -p output as the default case were unsuccessful in achieving consensus.  The  -p
       option was added to allow portable access to the values that can be saved and then later restored using; for example, a dot script.

FUTURE DIRECTIONS
       None.
