NAME
       gnutls_certificate_set_ocsp_status_request_mem - API function

SYNOPSIS
       #include <gnutls/gnutls.h>

       int gnutls_certificate_set_ocsp_status_request_mem(gnutls_certificate_credentials_t             sc, const gnutls_datum_t * resp_data, unsigned idx, gnutls_x509_crt_fmt_t fmt);

ARGUMENTS
       gnutls_certificate_credentials_t             sc
                   is a credentials structure.

       const gnutls_datum_t * resp_data
                   a memory buffer holding an OCSP response

       unsigned idx
                   is a certificate index as returned by gnutls_certificate_set_key() and friends

       gnutls_x509_crt_fmt_t fmt
                   is PEM or DER

DESCRIPTION
       This function sets the OCSP responses to be sent to the peer for the certificate chain specified by  idx . When  fmt is set to PEM, multiple responses can be loaded.

NOTE
       the  ability  to  set  multiple  OCSP  responses  per  credential  structure  via  the  index   idx  was added in version 3.5.6. To keep backwards compatibility, it requires using gnutls_certifi‐
       cate_set_flags() with the GNUTLS_CERTIFICATE_API_V2 flag to make the set certificate functions return an index usable by this function.

       This function must be called after setting any certificates, and cannot be used for certificates that are provided via a callback -- that  is  when  gnutls_certificate_set_retrieve_function()  is
       used.

       This  function  can  be  called multiple times when multiple responses which apply to the certificate chain are available.  If the response provided does not match any certificates present in the
       chain, the code GNUTLS_E_OCSP_MISMATCH_WITH_CERTS is returned.  If the response is already expired at the time of loading the code GNUTLS_E_EXPIRED is returned.

RETURNS
       On success, the number of loaded responses is returned, otherwise a negative error code.

SINCE
       3.6.3
