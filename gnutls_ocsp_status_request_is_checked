NAME
       gnutls_ocsp_status_request_is_checked - API function

SYNOPSIS
       #include <gnutls/gnutls.h>

       unsigned gnutls_ocsp_status_request_is_checked(gnutls_session_t session, unsigned int flags);

ARGUMENTS
       gnutls_session_t session
                   is a gnutls session

       unsigned int flags
                   should be zero or GNUTLS_OCSP_SR_IS_AVAIL

DESCRIPTION
       When  flags  are  zero this function returns non-zero if a valid OCSP status response was included in the TLS handshake. That is, an OCSP status response which is not too old, superseded or marks
       the certificate as revoked.  It returns zero otherwise.

       When the flag GNUTLS_OCSP_SR_IS_AVAIL is specified, the function returns non-zero if an OCSP status response was included in the handshake even if it was invalid. Otherwise, if no OCSP status re‐
       sponse was included, it returns zero. The GNUTLS_OCSP_SR_IS_AVAIL flag was introduced in GnuTLS 3.4.0.

       This is a helper function when needing to decide whether to perform an explicit OCSP validity check on the peer's certificate. Should be called after any of gnutls_certificate_verify_peers*() are
       called.

       This function is always usable on client side, but on server side only under TLS 1.3, which is the first version of TLS that allows cliend-side OCSP responses.

RETURNS
       Non-zero if the response was valid, or a zero if it wasn't sent, or sent and was invalid.

SINCE
       3.1.4
