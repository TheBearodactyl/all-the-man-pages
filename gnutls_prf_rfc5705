NAME
       gnutls_prf_rfc5705 - API function

SYNOPSIS
       #include <gnutls/gnutls.h>

       int gnutls_prf_rfc5705(gnutls_session_t session, size_t label_size, const char * label, size_t context_size, const char * context, size_t outsize, char * out);

ARGUMENTS
       gnutls_session_t session
                   is a gnutls_session_t type.

       size_t label_size
                   length of the  label variable.

       const char * label
                   label used in PRF computation, typically a short string.

       size_t context_size
                   length of the  extra variable.

       const char * context
                   optional extra data to seed the PRF with.

       size_t outsize
                   size of pre-allocated output buffer to hold the output.

       char * out  pre-allocated buffer to hold the generated data.

DESCRIPTION
       Exports keying material from TLS/DTLS session to an application, as specified in RFC5705.

       In the TLS versions prior to 1.3, it applies the TLS Pseudo-Random-Function (PRF) on the master secret and the provided data, seeded with the client and server random fields.

       In TLS 1.3, it applies HKDF on the exporter master secret derived from the master secret.

       The  label variable usually contains a string denoting the purpose for the generated data.

       The   context variable can be used to add more data to the seed, after the random variables.  It can be used to make sure the generated output is strongly connected to some additional data (e.g.,
       a string used in user authentication).

       The output is placed in  out , which must be pre-allocated.

       Note that, to provide the RFC5705 context, the  context variable must be non-null.

RETURNS
       GNUTLS_E_SUCCESS on success, or an error code.
