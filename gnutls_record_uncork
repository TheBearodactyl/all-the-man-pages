NAME
       gnutls_record_uncork - API function

SYNOPSIS
       #include <gnutls/gnutls.h>

       int gnutls_record_uncork(gnutls_session_t session, unsigned int flags);

ARGUMENTS
       gnutls_session_t session
                   is a gnutls_session_t type.

       unsigned int flags
                   Could be zero or GNUTLS_RECORD_WAIT

DESCRIPTION
       This resets the effect of gnutls_record_cork(), and flushes any pending data. If the GNUTLS_RECORD_WAIT flag is specified then this function will block until the data is sent or a fatal error oc‐
       curs (i.e., the function will retry on GNUTLS_E_AGAIN and GNUTLS_E_INTERRUPTED).

       If the flag GNUTLS_RECORD_WAIT is not specified and the function is interrupted then the GNUTLS_E_AGAIN or GNUTLS_E_INTERRUPTED errors will be returned. To obtain the data left in the corked buf‐
       fer use gnutls_record_check_corked().

RETURNS
       On success the number of transmitted data is returned, or otherwise a negative error code.

SINCE
       3.1.9
