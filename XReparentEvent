NAME
       XReparentEvent - ReparentNotify event structure

STRUCTURES
       The structure for ReparentNotify events contains:

       typedef struct {
               int type;       /* ReparentNotify */
               unsigned long serial;   /* # of last request processed by server */
               Bool send_event;        /* true if this came from a SendEvent request */
               Display *display;       /* Display the event was read from */
               Window event;
               Window window;
               Window parent;
               int x, y;
               Bool override_redirect;
       } XReparentEvent;

       When you receive this event, the structure members are set as follows.

       The  type  member is set to the event type constant name that uniquely identifies it.  For example, when the X server reports a GraphicsExpose event to a client application, it sends an XGraphic‐
       sExposeEvent structure with the type member set to GraphicsExpose.  The display member is set to a pointer to the display the event was read on.  The send_event member is set to True if the event
       came  from a SendEvent protocol request.  The serial member is set from the serial number reported in the protocol but expanded from the 16-bit least-significant bits to a full 32-bit value.  The
       window member is set to the window that is most useful to toolkit dispatchers.

       The event member is set either to the reparented window or to the old or the new parent, depending on whether StructureNotify or SubstructureNotify was selected.  The window member is set to  the
       window  that was reparented.  The parent member is set to the new parent window.  The x and y members are set to the reparented window's coordinates relative to the new parent window's origin and
       define the upper-left outer corner of the reparented window.  The override_redirect member is set to the override-redirect attribute of the window specified by the window member.  Window  manager
       clients normally should ignore this window if the override_redirect member is True.
