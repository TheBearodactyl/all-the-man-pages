PCRE2_CODE_COPY(3)         Library Functions Manual         PCRE2_CODE_COPY(3)

NAME
       PCRE2 - Perl-compatible regular expressions (revised API)

SYNOPSIS

       #include <pcre2.h>

       pcre2_code *pcre2_code_copy_with_tables(const pcre2_code *code);

DESCRIPTION

       This  function  makes a copy of the memory used for a compiled pattern,
       excluding any memory used by the JIT  compiler.  Without  a  subsequent
       call  to  pcre2_jit_compile(),  the  copy  can be used only for non-JIT
       matching.  Unlike pcre2_code_copy(), a separate copy of  the  character
       tables is also made, with the new code pointing to it. This memory will
       be automatically freed when pcre2_code_free() is called. The  yield  of
       the  function is NULL if code is NULL or if sufficient memory cannot be
       obtained.

       There is a complete description of the PCRE2 native API in the pcre2api
       page and a description of the POSIX API in the pcre2posix page.
