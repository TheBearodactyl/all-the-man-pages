NAME
       ts_libversion - get version information on the currently running tslib

SYNOPSIS
       #include <tslib.h>

       struct ts_lib_version_data *ts_libversion();

DESCRIPTION
       ts_libversion() This function returns a pointer to a static copy of the version info struct:

       struct ts_lib_version_data {
               const char      *package_version;
               int             version_num;
               unsigned int    features;
       };

       package_version is just the string containing the tarball release number, e.g. "1.10".

       version_num is a 24 bit number created like this: <8 bits major number> | <8 bits minor number> | <8 bits patch number> of the library libts. Version 0.7.1 is therefore returned as 0x000701.

       features can have one or more bits set. The currently defined bits are:
           TSLIB_VERSION_MT  tslib  filters  support  multitouch  ts_read_mt() and there is at least one raw access module supporting it (currently evdev input) TSLIB_VERSION_OPEN_RESTRICTED ts_open_re‐
           stricted and ts_close_restricted function pointers are available to implement TSLIB_VERSION_EVENTPATH ts_get_eventpath() is available since tslib can auto-detect a  device  TSLIB_VERSION_VER‐
           SION simple tslib_version() and ts_print_ascii_logo() are available

RETURN VALUE
       This function returns a pointer to a static copy of the version info struct.
