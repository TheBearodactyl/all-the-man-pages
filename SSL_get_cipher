SSL_GET_CURRENT_CIPHER(3ssl)        OpenSSL       SSL_GET_CURRENT_CIPHER(3ssl)

NAME
       SSL_get_current_cipher, SSL_get_cipher_name, SSL_get_cipher,
       SSL_get_cipher_bits, SSL_get_cipher_version, SSL_get_pending_cipher -
       get SSL_CIPHER of a connection

SYNOPSIS
        #include <openssl/ssl.h>

        const SSL_CIPHER *SSL_get_current_cipher(const SSL *ssl);
        const SSL_CIPHER *SSL_get_pending_cipher(const SSL *ssl);

        const char *SSL_get_cipher_name(const SSL *s);
        const char *SSL_get_cipher(const SSL *s);
        int SSL_get_cipher_bits(const SSL *s, int *np);
        const char *SSL_get_cipher_version(const SSL *s);

DESCRIPTION
       SSL_get_current_cipher() returns a pointer to an SSL_CIPHER object
       containing the description of the actually used cipher of a connection
       established with the ssl object.  See SSL_CIPHER_get_name(3) for more
       details.

       SSL_get_cipher_name() obtains the name of the currently used cipher.
       SSL_get_cipher() is identical to SSL_get_cipher_name().
       SSL_get_cipher_bits() is a macro to obtain the number of
       secret/algorithm bits used and SSL_get_cipher_version() returns the
       protocol name.

       SSL_get_pending_cipher() returns a pointer to an SSL_CIPHER object
       containing the description of the cipher (if any) that has been
       negotiated for future use on the connection established with the ssl
       object, but is not yet in use.  This may be the case during handshake
       processing, when control flow can be returned to the application via
       any of several callback methods.  The internal sequencing of handshake
       processing and callback invocation is not guaranteed to be stable from
       release to release, and at present only the callback set by
       SSL_CTX_set_alpn_select_cb() is guaranteed to have a non-NULL return
       value.  Other callbacks may be added to this list over time.

RETURN VALUES
       SSL_get_current_cipher() returns the cipher actually used, or NULL if
       no session has been established.

       SSL_get_pending_cipher() returns the cipher to be used at the next
       change of cipher suite, or NULL if no such cipher is known.

NOTES
       SSL_get_cipher, SSL_get_cipher_bits, SSL_get_cipher_version, and
       SSL_get_cipher_name are implemented as macros.
