NAME
       CURLOPT_TIMEOUT_MS - maximum time the transfer is allowed to complete

SYNOPSIS
       #include <curl/curl.h>

       CURLcode curl_easy_setopt(CURL *handle, CURLOPT_TIMEOUT_MS, long timeout);

DESCRIPTION
       Pass  a long as parameter containing timeout - the maximum time in milliseconds that you allow the libcurl transfer operation to take. Normally, name lookups can take a considerable time and lim‐
       iting operations to less than a few minutes risk aborting perfectly normal operations. This option may cause libcurl to use the SIGALRM signal to timeout system calls.

       If libcurl is built to use the standard system name resolver, that portion of the transfer will still use full-second resolution for timeouts with a minimum timeout allowed of one second.

       In unix-like systems, this might cause signals to be used unless CURLOPT_NOSIGNAL(3) is set.

       If both CURLOPT_TIMEOUT(3) and CURLOPT_TIMEOUT_MS(3) are set, the value set last will be used.

       Since this puts a hard limit for how long time a request is allowed to take, it has limited use in dynamic  use  cases  with  varying  transfer  times.  You  are  then  advised  to  explore  CUR‐
       LOPT_LOW_SPEED_LIMIT(3), CURLOPT_LOW_SPEED_TIME(3) or using CURLOPT_PROGRESSFUNCTION(3) to implement your own timeout logic.

DEFAULT
       Default timeout is 0 (zero) which means it never times out during transfer.

PROTOCOLS
       All

EXAMPLE
       CURL *curl = curl_easy_init();
       if(curl) {
         curl_easy_setopt(curl, CURLOPT_URL, "https://example.com");

         /* complete within 20000 milliseconds */
         curl_easy_setopt(curl, CURLOPT_TIMEOUT_MS, 20000L);

         curl_easy_perform(curl);
       }

AVAILABILITY
       Always

RETURN VALUE
       Returns CURLE_OK
