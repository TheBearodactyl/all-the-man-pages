NAME
       xcb_image_text_16 - Draws text

SYNOPSIS
       #include <xcb/xproto.h>

   Request function
       xcb_void_cookie_t xcb_image_text_16(xcb_connection_t *conn, uint8_t string_len, xcb_drawable_t drawable, xcb_gcontext_t gc, int16_t x, int16_t y, const xcb_char2b_t *string);

REQUEST ARGUMENTS
       conn      The XCB connection to X11.

       string_len
                 The length of the string in characters. Note that this parameter limited by 255 due to using 8 bits!

       drawable  The drawable (Window or Pixmap) to draw text on.

       gc        The graphics context to use.

                 The following graphics context components are used: plane-mask, foreground, background, font, subwindow-mode, clip-x-origin, clip-y-origin, and clip-mask.

       x         The x coordinate of the first character, relative to the origin of drawable.

       y         The y coordinate of the first character, relative to the origin of drawable.

       string    The string to draw. Only the first 255 characters are relevant due to the data type of string_len. Every character uses 2 bytes (hence the 16 in this request's name).

DESCRIPTION
       Fills the destination rectangle with the background pixel from gc, then paints the text with the foreground pixel from gc. The upper-left corner of the filled rectangle is at [x, y - font-as‚Äê
       cent]. The width is overall-width, the height is font-ascent + font-descent. The overall-width, font-ascent and font-descent are as returned by xcb_query_text_extents (TODO).

       Note that using X core fonts is deprecated (but still supported) in favor of client-side rendering using Xft.

RETURN VALUE
       Returns an xcb_void_cookie_t. Errors (if any) have to be handled in the event loop.

       If you want to handle errors directly with xcb_request_check instead, use xcb_image_text_16_checked. See xcb-requests(3) for details.

ERRORS
       xcb_drawable_error_t
                 The specified drawable (Window or Pixmap) does not exist.

       xcb_g_context_error_t
                 The specified graphics context does not exist.

       xcb_match_error_t
                 TODO: reasons?
