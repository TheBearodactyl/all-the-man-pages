SYNOPSIS
       #include <gnutls/x509.h>

       int gnutls_x509_crt_set_key_purpose_oid(gnutls_x509_crt_t cert, const void * oid, unsigned int critical);

ARGUMENTS
       gnutls_x509_crt_t cert

       const void * oid
                   a pointer to a null terminated string that holds the OID

       unsigned int critical
                   Whether this extension will be critical or not

DESCRIPTION
       This function will set the key purpose OIDs of the Certificate.  These are stored in the Extended Key Usage extension (2.5.29.37) See the GNUTLS_KP_* definitions for human readable names.
