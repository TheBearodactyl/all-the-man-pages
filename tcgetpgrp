NAME
       tcgetpgrp, tcsetpgrp - get and set terminal foreground process group

LIBRARY
       Standard C library (libc, -lc)

SYNOPSIS
       #include <unistd.h>

       pid_t tcgetpgrp(int fd);
       int tcsetpgrp(int fd, pid_t pgrp);

DESCRIPTION
       The function tcgetpgrp() returns the process group ID of the foreground process group on the terminal associated to fd, which must be the controlling terminal of the calling process.

       The  function  tcsetpgrp()  makes the process group with process group ID pgrp the foreground process group on the terminal associated to fd, which must be the controlling terminal of the calling
       process, and still be associated with its session.  Moreover, pgrp must be a (nonempty) process group belonging to the same session as the calling process.

       If tcsetpgrp() is called by a member of a background process group in its session, and the calling process is not blocking or ignoring SIGTTOU, a SIGTTOU signal is sent to  all  members  of  this
       background process group.

RETURN VALUE
       When  fd  refers  to  the controlling terminal of the calling process, the function tcgetpgrp() will return the foreground process group ID of that terminal if there is one, and some value larger
       than 1 that is not presently a process group ID otherwise.  When fd does not refer to the controlling terminal of the calling process, -1 is returned, and errno is set to indicate the error.

       When successful, tcsetpgrp() returns 0.  Otherwise, it returns -1, and errno is set to indicate the error.

ERRORS
       EBADF  fd is not a valid file descriptor.

       EINVAL pgrp has an unsupported value.

       ENOTTY The calling process does not have a controlling terminal, or it has one but it is not described by fd, or, for tcsetpgrp(), this controlling terminal is no longer associated with the  ses‐
              sion of the calling process.

       EPERM  pgrp has a supported value, but is not the process group ID of a process in the same session as the calling process.

PROLOG

NAME
       tcgetpgrp — get the foreground process group ID

SYNOPSIS
       #include <unistd.h>

       pid_t tcgetpgrp(int fildes);

DESCRIPTION
       The tcgetpgrp() function shall return the value of the process group ID of the foreground process group associated with the terminal.

       If there is no foreground process group, tcgetpgrp() shall return a value greater than 1 that does not match the process group ID of any existing process group.

       The tcgetpgrp() function is allowed from a process that is a member of a background process group; however, the information may be subsequently changed by a process that is a member  of  a  fore‐
       ground process group.

RETURN VALUE
       Upon successful completion, tcgetpgrp() shall return the value of the process group ID of the foreground process associated with the terminal. Otherwise, -1 shall be returned and errno set to in‐
       dicate the error.

ERRORS
       The tcgetpgrp() function shall fail if:

       EBADF  The fildes argument is not a valid file descriptor.

       ENOTTY The calling process does not have a controlling terminal, or the file is not the controlling terminal.
