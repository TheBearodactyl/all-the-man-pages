NAME
       sd_bus_error_add_map, sd_bus_error_map, SD_BUS_ERROR_MAP,
       SD_BUS_ERROR_END - Additional sd-dbus error mappings

SYNOPSIS
       #include <systemd/sd-bus.h>

       typedef struct {
               const char *name;
               int code;
               ...
       } sd_bus_error_map;

       SD_BUS_ERROR_MAP(name, code)

       SD_BUS_ERROR_MAP_END

       int sd_bus_error_add_map(const sd_bus_error_map *map);

DESCRIPTION
       The sd_bus_error_add_map() call may be used to register additional
       mappings for converting D-Bus errors to Linux errno-style errors. The
       mappings defined with this call are consulted by calls such as
       sd_bus_error_set(3) or sd_bus_error_get_errno(3). By default, a number
       of generic, standardized mappings are known, as documented in sd-bus-
       errors(3). Use this call to add further, application-specific mappings.

       The function takes a pointer to an array of sd_bus_error_map
       structures. A reference to the specified array is added to the lookup
       tables for error mappings. Note that the structure is not copied, and
       that it is hence essential that the array stays available and constant
       during the entire remaining runtime of the process.

       The mapping array should be put together with a series of
       SD_BUS_ERROR_MAP() macro invocations that take a literal name string
       and a (positive) errno-style error number. The last entry of the array
       should be an invocation of the SD_BUS_ERROR_MAP_END macro. The array
       should not be put together without use of these two macros.

       Note that the call is idempotent: it is safe to invoke it multiple
       times with the parameter, which will only add the passed mapping array
       once.

       Note that the memory allocated by this call is not intended to be freed
       during the lifetime of the process. It should not be freed explicitly.

RETURN VALUE
       sd_bus_error_add_map() returns a positive value when the new array was
       added to the lookup tables. It returns zero when the same array was
       already added before. On error, a negative errno-style error code is
       returned. See below for known error codes.

   Errors
       Returned errors may indicate the following problems:

       -EINVAL
           The specified mapping array is invalid.

       -ENOMEM
           Memory allocation failed.

NOTES
       These APIs are implemented as a shared library, which can be compiled
       and linked to with the libsystemd pkg-config(1) file.
