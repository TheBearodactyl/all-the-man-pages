NAME
       SSL_load_client_CA_file_ex, SSL_load_client_CA_file,
       SSL_add_file_cert_subjects_to_stack,
       SSL_add_dir_cert_subjects_to_stack,
       SSL_add_store_cert_subjects_to_stack - load certificate names

SYNOPSIS
        #include <openssl/ssl.h>

        STACK_OF(X509_NAME) *SSL_load_client_CA_file_ex(const char *file,
                                                        OSSL_LIB_CTX *libctx,
                                                        const char *propq);
        STACK_OF(X509_NAME) *SSL_load_client_CA_file(const char *file);

        int SSL_add_file_cert_subjects_to_stack(STACK_OF(X509_NAME) *stack,
                                                const char *file);
        int SSL_add_dir_cert_subjects_to_stack(STACK_OF(X509_NAME) *stack,
                                               const char *dir);
        int SSL_add_store_cert_subjects_to_stack(STACK_OF(X509_NAME) *stack,
                                                 const char *store);

DESCRIPTION
       SSL_load_client_CA_file_ex() reads certificates from file and returns a
       STACK_OF(X509_NAME) with the subject names found. The library context
       libctx and property query propq are used when fetching algorithms from
       providers.

       SSL_load_client_CA_file() is similar to SSL_load_client_CA_file_ex()
       but uses NULL for the library context libctx and property query propq.

       SSL_add_file_cert_subjects_to_stack() reads certificates from file, and
       adds their subject name to the already existing stack.

       SSL_add_dir_cert_subjects_to_stack() reads certificates from every file
       in the directory dir, and adds their subject name to the already
       existing stack.

       SSL_add_store_cert_subjects_to_stack() loads certificates from the
       store URI, and adds their subject name to the already existing stack.

NOTES
       SSL_load_client_CA_file() reads a file of PEM formatted certificates
       and extracts the X509_NAMES of the certificates found. While the name
       suggests the specific usage as support function for
       SSL_CTX_set_client_CA_list(3), it is not limited to CA certificates.

RETURN VALUES
       The following return values can occur:

       NULL
           The operation failed, check out the error stack for the reason.

       Pointer to STACK_OF(X509_NAME)
           Pointer to the subject names of the successfully read certificates.

EXAMPLES
       Load names of CAs from file and use it as a client CA list:

        SSL_CTX *ctx;
        STACK_OF(X509_NAME) *cert_names;

        ...
        cert_names = SSL_load_client_CA_file("/path/to/CAfile.pem");
        if (cert_names != NULL)
            SSL_CTX_set_client_CA_list(ctx, cert_names);
        else
            /* error */
        ...

HISTORY
       SSL_load_client_CA_file_ex() and SSL_add_store_cert_subjects_to_stack()
       were added in OpenSSL 3.0.
