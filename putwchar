putwchar(3)                Library Functions Manual                putwchar(3)

NAME
       putwchar - write a wide character to standard output

LIBRARY
       Standard C library (libc, -lc)

SYNOPSIS
       #include <wchar.h>

       wint_t putwchar(wchar_t wc);

DESCRIPTION
       The  putwchar()  function  is  the  wide-character  equivalent  of  the
       putchar(3) function.  It writes the wide character wc  to  stdout.   If
       ferror(stdout) becomes true, it returns WEOF.  If a wide character con‐
       version error occurs, it sets errno to EILSEQ and returns WEOF.  Other‐
       wise, it returns wc.

       For a nonlocking counterpart, see unlocked_stdio(3).

RETURN VALUE
       The putwchar() function returns wc if no error occurred, or WEOF to in‐
       dicate an error.

STANDARDS
       C11, POSIX.1-2008.

HISTORY
       POSIX.1-2001, C99.

NOTES
       The behavior of putwchar() depends on the LC_CTYPE category of the cur‐
       rent locale.

       It is reasonable to expect that  putwchar()  will  actually  write  the
       multibyte sequence corresponding to the wide character wc.

PROLOG
       This  manual  page is part of the POSIX Programmer's Manual.  The Linux
       implementation of this interface may differ (consult the  corresponding
       Linux  manual page for details of Linux behavior), or the interface may
       not be implemented on Linux.

NAME
       putwchar — put a wide character on a stdout stream

SYNOPSIS
       #include <wchar.h>

       wint_t putwchar(wchar_t wc);

DESCRIPTION
       The functionality described on this reference page is aligned with  the
       ISO C  standard.  Any  conflict between the requirements described here
       and the ISO C standard is unintentional. This  volume  of  POSIX.1‐2017
       defers to the ISO C standard.

       The function call putwchar(wc) shall be equivalent to putwc(wc,stdout).
