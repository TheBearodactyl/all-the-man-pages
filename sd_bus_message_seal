SD_BUS_MESSAGE_SEAL(3)        sd_bus_message_seal       SD_BUS_MESSAGE_SEAL(3)

NAME
       sd_bus_message_seal - Prepare a D-Bus message for transmission

SYNOPSIS
       #include <systemd/sd-bus.h>

       int sd_bus_message_seal(sd_bus_message *m, uint64_t cookie,
                               uint64_t timeout_usec);

DESCRIPTION
       sd_bus_message_seal() finishes the message m and prepares it for
       transmission using sd_bus_send(3).  cookie specifies the identifier
       used to match the message reply to its corresponding request.
       timeout_usec specifies the maximum time in microseconds to wait for a
       reply to arrive.

       Note that in most scenarios, it's not necessary to call this function
       directly.  sd_bus_call(3), sd_bus_call_async(3) and sd_bus_send(3) will
       seal any given messages if they have not been sealed yet.

RETURN VALUE
       On success, this function returns a non-negative integer. On failure,
       it returns a negative errno-style error code.

   Errors
       Returned errors may indicate the following problems:

       -EINVAL
           The m parameter is NULL.

       -EBADMSG
           The D-Bus message m has open containers.

       -ENOMSG
           The D-Bus message m is a reply but its type signature does not
           match the return type signature of its corresponding member in the
           object vtable.

NOTES
       These APIs are implemented as a shared library, which can be compiled
       and linked to with the libsystemd pkg-config(1) file.
