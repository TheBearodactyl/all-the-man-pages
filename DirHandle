NAME
       DirHandle - (obsolete) supply object methods for directory handles

SYNOPSIS
           # recommended approach since Perl 5.6: do not use DirHandle
           if (opendir my $d, '.') {
               while (readdir $d) { something($_); }
               rewind $d;
               while (readdir $d) { something_else($_); }
           }

           # how you would use this module if you were going to
           use DirHandle;
           if (my $d = DirHandle->new(".")) {
               while (defined($_ = $d->read)) { something($_); }
               $d->rewind;
               while (defined($_ = $d->read)) { something_else($_); }
           }

DESCRIPTION
       There is no reason to use this module nowadays.

       The "DirHandle" method provide an alternative interface to the opendir(), closedir(), readdir(), and rewinddir() functions.

       Up to Perl 5.5, opendir() could not autovivify a directory handle from "undef", so using a lexical handle required using a function from Symbol to create an anonymous glob, which took a separate
       step.  "DirHandle" encapsulates this, which allowed cleaner code than opendir().  Since Perl 5.6, opendir() alone has been all you need for lexical handles.
