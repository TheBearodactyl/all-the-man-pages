NAME
       idn2_check_version - API function

SYNOPSIS
       #include <idn2.h>

       const char * idn2_check_version(const char * req_version);

ARGUMENTS
       const char * req_version
                   version string to compare with, or NULL.

DESCRIPTION
       Check  IDN2  library  version.  This function can also be used to read out the version of the library code used.  See IDN2_VERSION for a suitable  req_version string, it corresponds to the idn2.h
       header file version.  Normally these two version numbers match, but if you are using an application built against an older libidn2 with a newer libidn2 shared library they will be different.

       Return value: Check that the version of the library is at minimum the one given as a string in  req_version and return the actual version string of the library; return NULL if  the  condition  is
       not met.  If NULL is passed to this function no check is done and only the version string is returned.
