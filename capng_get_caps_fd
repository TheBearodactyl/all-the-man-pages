NAME
       capng_get_caps_fd - Read file based capabilities

SYNOPSIS
       #include <cap-ng.h>

       int capng_get_caps_fd(int fd);

DESCRIPTION
       This  function  will read the file based capabilities stored in extended attributes of the file that the descriptor was opened against. The bounding set is not included in file based capabilities
       operations. Note that this function will only work if compiled on a kernel that supports file based capabilities such as 2.6.26 and later. If the "magic" bit is set, then  all  effect  capability
       bits are set. Otherwise the bits are cleared.

RETURN VALUE
       This returns 0 on success and -1 on failure.
