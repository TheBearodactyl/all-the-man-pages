NAME
       gnutls_x509_cidr_to_rfc5280 - API function

SYNOPSIS
       #include <gnutls/x509.h>

       int gnutls_x509_cidr_to_rfc5280(const char * cidr, gnutls_datum_t * cidr_rfc5280);

ARGUMENTS
       const char * cidr
                   CIDR in RFC4632 format (IP/prefix), null-terminated

       gnutls_datum_t * cidr_rfc5280
                   CIDR range converted to RFC5280 format

DESCRIPTION
       This function will convert text CIDR range with prefix (such as '10.0.0.0/8') to RFC5280 (IP address in network byte order followed by its network mask).  Works for both IPv4 and IPv6.

       The resulting object is directly usable for IP name constraints usage, for example in functions gnutls_x509_name_constraints_add_permitted or gnutls_x509_name_constraints_add_excluded.

       The data in datum needs to be deallocated using gnutls_free().

RETURNS
       On success, GNUTLS_E_SUCCESS (0) is returned, otherwise a negative error value.

SINCE
       3.5.4
