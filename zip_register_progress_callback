DESCRIPTION
     The function zip_register_progress_callback() is the obsolete version of zip_register_progress_callback_with_state(3).

     that's completely written to disk.  The value is a double in the range from 0.0 to 1.0.  This can be used to provide progress indicators for user interfaces.
