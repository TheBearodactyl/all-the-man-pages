NAME
       ungetwc - push back a wide character onto a FILE stream

LIBRARY
       Standard C library (libc, -lc)

SYNOPSIS
       #include <wchar.h>

       wint_t ungetwc(wint_t wc, FILE *stream);

DESCRIPTION
       The ungetwc() function is the wide-character equivalent of the ungetc(3) function.  It pushes back a wide character onto stream and returns it.

       If wc is WEOF, it returns WEOF.  If wc is an invalid wide character, it sets errno to EILSEQ and returns WEOF.

       If  wc  is  a  valid  wide character, it is pushed back onto the stream and thus becomes available for future wide-character read operations.  The file-position indicator is decremented by one or
       more.  The end-of-file indicator is cleared.  The backing storage of the file is not affected.

       Note: wc need not be the last wide-character read from the stream; it can be any other valid wide character.

       If the implementation supports multiple push-back operations in a row, the pushed-back wide characters will be read in reverse order; however, only one level of push-back is guaranteed.

RETURN VALUE
       The ungetwc() function returns wc when successful, or WEOF upon failure.

PROLOG

       the interface may not be implemented on Linux.

NAME
       ungetwc — push wide-character code back into the input stream

SYNOPSIS
       #include <stdio.h>
       #include <wchar.h>

       wint_t ungetwc(wint_t wc, FILE *stream);

DESCRIPTION
       The functionality described on this reference page is aligned with the ISO C standard. Any conflict between the requirements described here and the ISO C standard is unintentional. This volume of
       POSIX.1‐2017 defers to the ISO C standard.

       The  ungetwc() function shall push the character corresponding to the wide-character code specified by wc back onto the input stream pointed to by stream.  The pushed-back characters shall be re‐
       turned by subsequent reads on that stream in the reverse order of their pushing. A successful intervening call (with the stream pointed to by stream)  to  a  file-positioning  function  (fseek(),
       fseeko(), fsetpos(), or rewind()) or fflush() shall discard any pushed-back characters for the stream. The external storage corresponding to the stream is unchanged.

       At least one character of push-back shall be provided. If ungetwc() is called too many times on the same stream without an intervening read or file-positioning operation on that stream, the oper‐
       ation may fail.

       If the value of wc equals that of the macro WEOF, the operation shall fail and the input stream shall be left unchanged.

       A successful call to ungetwc() shall clear the end-of-file indicator for the stream. The value of the file-position indicator for the stream after all pushed-back characters have  been  read,  or
       discarded  by  calling fseek(), fseeko(), fsetpos(), or rewind() (but not fflush()), shall be the same as it was before the characters were pushed back. The file-position indicator is decremented
       (by one or more) by each successful call to ungetwc(); if its value was 0 before a call, its value is unspecified after the call.

RETURN VALUE
       Upon successful completion, ungetwc() shall return the wide-character code corresponding to the pushed-back character. Otherwise, it shall return WEOF.

ERRORS
       The ungetwc() function may fail if:

       EILSEQ An invalid character sequence is detected, or a wide-character code does not correspond to a valid character.
