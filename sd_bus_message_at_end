NAME
       sd_bus_message_at_end - Check if a message has been fully read

SYNOPSIS
       #include <systemd/sd-bus.h>

       int sd_bus_message_at_end(sd_bus_message *m, int complete);

DESCRIPTION
       sd_bus_message_at_end() returns whether all data from the currently
       opened container in m or all data from all containers in m has been
       read. If complete is zero, this function returns whether all data from
       the currently opened container has been read. If complete is non-zero,
       this function returns whether all data from all containers in m has
       been read.

RETURN VALUE
       If all data from all containers or the current container (depending on
       the value of complete) has been read, sd_bus_message_at_end() returns a
       positive integer. If there is still data left to be read, it returns
       zero. On failure, it returns a negative errno-style error code.

   Errors
       Returned errors may indicate the following problems:

       -EINVAL
           The m parameter is NULL.

       -EPERM
           The message is not sealed.

NOTES
       These APIs are implemented as a shared library, which can be compiled
       and linked to with the libsystemd pkg-config(1) file.
