NAME
       gnutls_x509_trust_list_add_named_crt - API function

SYNOPSIS
       #include <gnutls/x509.h>

       int gnutls_x509_trust_list_add_named_crt(gnutls_x509_trust_list_t list, gnutls_x509_crt_t cert, const void * name, size_t name_size, unsigned int flags);

ARGUMENTS
       gnutls_x509_trust_list_t list
                   The list

       gnutls_x509_crt_t cert
                   A certificate

       const void * name
                   An identifier for the certificate

       size_t name_size
                   The size of the identifier

       unsigned int flags
                   should be 0.

DESCRIPTION
       This  function  will  add the given certificate to the trusted list and associate it with a name. The certificate will not be be used for verification with gnutls_x509_trust_list_verify_crt() but
       with gnutls_x509_trust_list_verify_named_crt() or gnutls_x509_trust_list_verify_crt2() - the latter only since GnuTLS 3.4.0 and if a hostname is provided.

       In principle this function can be used to set individual "server" certificates that are trusted by the user for that specific server but for no other purposes.

       The certificate  cert must not be deinitialized during the lifetime of the  list .

RETURNS
       On success, GNUTLS_E_SUCCESS (0) is returned, otherwise a negative error value.

SINCE
       3.0.0
