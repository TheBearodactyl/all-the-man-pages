Pod::Perldoc::ToXml(3pePerl Programmers Reference GuPod::Perldoc::ToXml(3perl)

NAME
       Pod::Perldoc::ToXml - let Perldoc render Pod as XML

SYNOPSIS
         perldoc -o xml -d out.xml Some::Modulename

DESCRIPTION
       This is a "plug-in" class that allows Perldoc to use
       Pod::Simple::XMLOutStream as a formatter class.

       This is actually a Pod::Simple::XMLOutStream subclass, and inherits all
       its options.

       You have to have installed Pod::Simple::XMLOutStream (from the
       Pod::Simple dist), or this class won't work.

SEE ALSO
       Pod::Simple::XMLOutStream, Pod::Simple, Pod::Perldoc
