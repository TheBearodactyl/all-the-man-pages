NAME
       gnutls_ocsp_resp_get_single - API function

SYNOPSIS
       #include <gnutls/ocsp.h>

       int  gnutls_ocsp_resp_get_single(gnutls_ocsp_resp_const_t  resp, unsigned indx, gnutls_digest_algorithm_t * digest, gnutls_datum_t * issuer_name_hash, gnutls_datum_t * issuer_key_hash, gnutls_da‐
       tum_t * serial_number, unsigned int * cert_status, time_t * this_update, time_t * next_update, time_t * revocation_time, unsigned int * revocation_reason);

ARGUMENTS
       gnutls_ocsp_resp_const_t resp
                   should contain a gnutls_ocsp_resp_t type

       unsigned indx
                   Specifies response number to get. Use (0) to get the first one.

       gnutls_digest_algorithm_t * digest
                   output variable with gnutls_digest_algorithm_t hash algorithm

       gnutls_datum_t * issuer_name_hash
                   output buffer with hash of issuer's DN

       gnutls_datum_t * issuer_key_hash
                   output buffer with hash of issuer's public key

       gnutls_datum_t * serial_number
                   output buffer with serial number of certificate to check

       unsigned int * cert_status
                   a certificate status, a gnutls_ocsp_cert_status_t enum.

       time_t * this_update
                   time at which the status is known to be correct.

       time_t * next_update
                   when newer information will be available, or (time_t)-1 if unspecified

       time_t * revocation_time
                   when  cert_status is GNUTLS_OCSP_CERT_REVOKED, holds time of revocation.

       unsigned int * revocation_reason
                   revocation reason, a gnutls_x509_crl_reason_t enum.

DESCRIPTION
       This function will return the certificate information of the
        indx 'ed response in the Basic OCSP Response  resp .  The information returned corresponds to the OCSP SingleResponse structure except the final singleExtensions.

       Each of the pointers to output variables may be NULL to indicate that the caller is not interested in that value.

RETURNS
       On success, GNUTLS_E_SUCCESS (0) is returned, otherwise a negative error code is returned.  If you have reached the last CertID available GNUTLS_E_REQUESTED_DATA_NOT_AVAILABLE will be returned.
