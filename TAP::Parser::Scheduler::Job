NAME
       TAP::Parser::Scheduler::Job - A single testing job.

VERSION
       Version 3.44

SYNOPSIS
           use TAP::Parser::Scheduler::Job;

DESCRIPTION
       Represents a single test 'job'.

METHODS
   Class Methods
       "new"

           my $job = TAP::Parser::Scheduler::Job->new(
               $filename, $description
           );

       Given the filename and description of a test as scalars, returns a new TAP::Parser::Scheduler::Job object.

   Instance Methods
       "on_finish"

           $self->on_finish(\&method).

       Register a closure to be called when this job is destroyed. The callback will be passed the "TAP::Parser::Scheduler::Job" object as it's only argument.

       "finish"

          $self->finish;

       Called when a job is complete to unlock it. If a callback has been registered with "on_finish", it calls it. Otherwise, it does nothing.

   Attributes
         $self->filename;
         $self->description;
         $self->context;

       These are all "getters" which return the data set for these attributes during object construction.

       "filename"

       "description"

       "context"

       "as_array_ref"

       For backwards compatibility in callbacks.

       "is_spinner"

         $self->is_spinner;

       Returns false indicating that this is a real job rather than a 'spinner'. Spinners are returned when the scheduler still has pending jobs but can't (because of locking) return one right now.
