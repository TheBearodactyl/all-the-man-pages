NAME
       gnutls_heartbeat_set_timeouts - API function

SYNOPSIS
       #include <gnutls/gnutls.h>

       void gnutls_heartbeat_set_timeouts(gnutls_session_t session, unsigned int retrans_timeout, unsigned int total_timeout);

ARGUMENTS
       gnutls_session_t session
                   is a gnutls_session_t type.

       unsigned int retrans_timeout
                   The time at which a retransmission will occur in milliseconds

       unsigned int total_timeout
