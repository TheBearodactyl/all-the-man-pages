NAME
       ldap_modrdn, ldap_modrdn_s, ldap_modrdn2, ldap_modrdn2_s - Perform an LDAP modify RDN operation

LIBRARY
       OpenLDAP LDAP (libldap, -lldap)

SYNOPSIS
       #include <ldap.h>

       int ldap_modrdn(ld, dn, newrdn)
       LDAP ∗ld;
       char ∗dn, ∗newrdn;

       int ldap_modrdn_s(ld, dn, newrdn)
       LDAP ∗ld;
       char ∗dn, ∗newrdn;

       int ldap_modrdn2(ld, dn, newrdn, deleteoldrdn)
       LDAP ∗ld;
       char ∗dn, ∗newrdn;
       int deleteoldrdn;

       int ldap_modrdn2_s(ld, dn, newrdn, deleteoldrdn)
       LDAP ∗ld;
       char ∗dn, ∗newrdn;
       int deleteoldrdn;

DESCRIPTION
       The ldap_modrdn() and ldap_modrdn_s() routines perform an LDAP modify RDN operation.  They both take dn, the DN of the entry whose RDN is to be changed, and newrdn, the new RDN to give the entry.
       The old RDN of the entry is never kept as an attribute of the entry.  ldap_modrdn() is asynchronous, returning the message id of the operation it initiates.  ldap_modrdn_s() is  synchronous,  re‐
       turning the LDAP error code indicating the success or failure of the operation.  Use of these routines is deprecated.  Use the versions described below instead.

       The  ldap_modrdn2()  and ldap_modrdn2_s() routines also perform an LDAP modify RDN operation, taking the same parameters as above.  In addition, they both take the deleteoldrdn parameter which is
       used as a boolean value to indicate whether the old RDN values should be deleted from the entry or not.

ERRORS
       The synchronous (_s) versions of these routines return an LDAP error code, either LDAP_SUCCESS or an error if there was trouble.  The asynchronous versions return -1 in case of  trouble,  setting
       the ld_errno field of ld.  See ldap_error(3) for more details.
