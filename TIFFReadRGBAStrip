NAME
       TIFFReadRGBAStrip - read and decode an image strip into a fixed-format raster

SYNOPSIS
          #include <tiffio.h>

       int TIFFReadRGBAStrip(TIFF *tif, uint32_t row, uint32_t *raster)

       int TIFFReadRGBAStripExt(TIFF *tif, uint32_t row, uint32_t *raster, int stop_on_error)

DESCRIPTION
       TIFFReadRGBAStrip()  reads  a  single strip of a strip-based image into memory, storing the result in the user supplied RGBA raster.  The raster is assumed to be an array of ImageWidth × RowsPer‐
       Strip 32-bit entries, where ImageWidth is the width of the image (TIFFTAG_IMAGEWIDTH) and RowsPerStrip is the maximum lines in a strip (TIFFTAG_ROWSPERSTRIP).

       TIFFReadRGBAStripExt() provides the paramater stop_on_error.  Its behaviour is described at TIFFReadRGBAImage.

       The row value should be the row of the first row in the strip (strip × RowsPerStrip, zero based).

       Note that the raster is assume to be organized such that the pixel at location (x, y) is raster [ y × width + x ]; with the raster origin in the lower-left hand corner of the strip. That is  bot‐
       tom to top organization.  When reading a partial last strip in the file the last line of the image will begin at the beginning of the buffer.

       Raster  pixels are 8-bit packed red, green, blue, alpha samples. The macros TIFFGetR, TIFFGetG, TIFFGetB, and TIFFGetA should be used to access individual samples. Images without Associated Alpha
       matting information have a constant Alpha of 1.0 (255).

       See the TIFFRGBAImage page for more details on how various image types are converted to RGBA values.

NOTES
       Samples must be either 1, 2, 4, 8, or 16 bits.  Colorimetric samples/pixel must be either 1, 3, or 4 (i.e. SamplesPerPixel - ExtraSamples).

       Palette image colormaps that appear to be incorrectly written as 8-bit values are automatically scaled to 16-bits.

       TIFFReadRGBAStrip() is just a wrapper around the more general TIFFRGBAImage facilities.  It’s main advantage over the similar TIFFReadRGBAImage() function is that for large images a single buffer
       capable of holding the whole image doesn’t need to be allocated, only enough for one strip.  The TIFFReadRGBATile() function does a similar operation for tiled images.

RETURN VALUES
       1 is returned if the image was successfully read and converted.  Otherwise, 0 is returned if an error was encountered.

DIAGNOSTICS
       All error messages are directed to the TIFFErrorExtR() routine.

       "Sorry, can not handle %d-bit pictures":
          The image had BitsPerSample other than 1, 2, 4, 8, or 16.

       "Sorry, can not handle %d-channel images":
          The image had SamplesPerPixel other than 1, 3, or 4.

       Missing needed "PhotometricInterpretation" tag:
          The image did not have a tag that describes how to display the data.

       No "PhotometricInterpretation" tag, assuming RGB:
          The image was missing a tag that describes how to display it, but because it has 3 or 4 samples/pixel, it is assumed to be RGB.

       No "PhotometricInterpretation" tag, assuming min-is-black\fP:
          The image was missing a tag that describes how to display it, but because it has 1 sample/pixel, it is assumed to be a grayscale or bilevel image.

       "No space for photometric conversion table":
          There was insufficient memory for a table used to convert image samples to 8-bit RGB.

       Missing required "Colormap" tag:
          A Palette image did not have a required Colormap tag.

       "No space for tile buffer":
          There was insufficient memory to allocate an i/o buffer.

       "No space for strip buffer":
          There was insufficient memory to allocate an i/o buffer.

       "Can not handle format":
          The image has a format (combination of BitsPerSample, SamplesPerPixel, and PhotometricInterpretation) that TIFFReadRGBAImage() can not handle.

       "No space for B&W mapping table":
          There was insufficient memory to allocate a table used to map grayscale data to RGB.

       "No space for Palette mapping table":
          There was insufficient memory to allocate a table used to map data to 8-bit RGB.
