strspn(3)                  Library Functions Manual                  strspn(3)

NAME
       strspn, strcspn - get length of a prefix substring

LIBRARY
       Standard C library (libc, -lc)

SYNOPSIS
       #include <string.h>

       size_t strspn(const char *s, const char *accept);
       size_t strcspn(const char *s, const char *reject);

DESCRIPTION
       The  strspn()  function calculates the length (in bytes) of the initial
       segment of s which consists entirely of bytes in accept.

       The strcspn() function calculates the length of the initial segment  of
       s which consists entirely of bytes not in reject.

RETURN VALUE
       The  strspn()  function returns the number of bytes in the initial seg‐
       ment of s which consist only of bytes from accept.

       The strcspn() function returns the number of bytes in the initial  seg‐
       ment of s which are not in the string reject.

PROLOG
       This  manual  page is part of the POSIX Programmer's Manual.  The Linux
       implementation of this interface may differ (consult the  corresponding
       Linux  manual page for details of Linux behavior), or the interface may
       not be implemented on Linux.

NAME
       strspn — get length of a substring

SYNOPSIS
       #include <string.h>

       size_t strspn(const char *s1, const char *s2);

DESCRIPTION
       The functionality described on this reference page is aligned with  the
       ISO C  standard.  Any  conflict between the requirements described here
       and the ISO C standard is unintentional. This  volume  of  POSIX.1‐2017
       defers to the ISO C standard.

       The  strspn() function shall compute the length (in bytes) of the maxi‐
       mum initial segment of the string pointed to by s1 which  consists  en‐
       tirely of bytes from the string pointed to by s2.

RETURN VALUE
       The strspn() function shall return the computed length; no return value
       is reserved to indicate an error.

ERRORS
       No errors are defined.

       The following sections are informative.

EXAMPLES
       None.

APPLICATION USAGE
       None.

RATIONALE
       None.

FUTURE DIRECTIONS
       None.
