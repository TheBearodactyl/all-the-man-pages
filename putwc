fputwc(3)                  Library Functions Manual                  fputwc(3)

NAME
       fputwc, putwc - write a wide character to a FILE stream

LIBRARY
       Standard C library (libc, -lc)

SYNOPSIS
       #include <stdio.h>
       #include <wchar.h>

       wint_t fputwc(wchar_t wc, FILE *stream);
       wint_t putwc(wchar_t wc, FILE *stream);

DESCRIPTION
       The  fputwc() function is the wide-character equivalent of the fputc(3)
       function.  It  writes  the  wide  character  wc  to  stream.   If  fer‐
       ror(stream) becomes true, it returns WEOF.  If a wide-character conver‐
       sion error occurs, it sets errno to EILSEQ and  returns  WEOF.   Other‐
       wise, it returns wc.

       The  putwc()  function  or macro functions identically to fputwc().  It
       may be implemented as a macro, and may evaluate its argument more  than
       once.  There is no reason ever to use it.

       For nonlocking counterparts, see unlocked_stdio(3).

RETURN VALUE
       On success, fputwc() function returns wc.  Otherwise, WEOF is returned,
       and errno is set to indicate the error.

ERRORS
       Apart from the usual ones, there is

       EILSEQ Conversion of wc to the stream's encoding fails.

STANDARDS
       C11, POSIX.1-2008.

HISTORY
       C99, POSIX.1-2001.

NOTES
       The  behavior  of fputwc() depends on the LC_CTYPE category of the cur‐
       rent locale.

       In the absence of additional information passed to the  fopen(3)  call,
       it is reasonable to expect that fputwc() will actually write the multi‐
       byte sequence corresponding to the wide character wc.

PROLOG
       This  manual  page is part of the POSIX Programmer's Manual.  The Linux
       implementation of this interface may differ (consult the  corresponding
       Linux  manual page for details of Linux behavior), or the interface may
       not be implemented on Linux.

NAME
       putwc — put a wide character on a stream

SYNOPSIS
       #include <stdio.h>
       #include <wchar.h>

       wint_t putwc(wchar_t wc, FILE *stream);

DESCRIPTION
       The functionality described on this reference page is aligned with  the
       ISO C  standard.  Any  conflict between the requirements described here
       and the ISO C standard is unintentional. This  volume  of  POSIX.1‐2017
       defers to the ISO C standard.

       The putwc() function shall be equivalent to fputwc(), except that if it
       is implemented as a macro it may evaluate stream more than once, so the
       argument should never be an expression with side-effects.

RETURN VALUE
       Refer to fputwc().

ERRORS
       Refer to fputwc().

       The following sections are informative.

EXAMPLES
       None.

APPLICATION USAGE
       Since  it may be implemented as a macro, putwc() may treat a stream ar‐
       gument with side-effects  incorrectly.  In  particular,  putwc(wc,*f++)
       need  not work correctly. Therefore, use of this function is not recom‐
       mended; fputwc() should be used instead.

RATIONALE
       None.

FUTURE DIRECTIONS
       None.
