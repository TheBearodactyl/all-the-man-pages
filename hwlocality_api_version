NAME
       hwlocality_api_version - API version

SYNOPSIS
   Macros
       #define HWLOC_API_VERSION   0x00020800
       #define HWLOC_COMPONENT_ABI   7

   Functions
       unsigned hwloc_get_api_version (void)

Detailed Description
Macro Definition Documentation
   #define HWLOC_API_VERSION   0x00020800
       Indicate at build time which hwloc API version is being used. This number is updated to (X<<16)+(Y<<8)+Z when a new release X.Y.Z actually modifies the API.

       Users may check for available features at build time using this number (see How do I handle API changes?).

       Note
           This should not be confused with HWLOC_VERSION, the library version. Two stable releases of the same series usually have the same HWLOC_API_VERSION even if their HWLOC_VERSION are different.

   #define HWLOC_COMPONENT_ABI   7
       Current component and plugin ABI version (see hwloc/plugins.h)

Function Documentation
   unsigned hwloc_get_api_version (void)
       Indicate at runtime which hwloc API version was used at build time. Should be HWLOC_API_VERSION if running on the same version.
