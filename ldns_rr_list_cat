NAME
       ldns_rr_list_cat, ldns_rr_list_push_rr, ldns_rr_list_pop_rr - ldns_rr_list manipulation

SYNOPSIS
       #include <stdint.h>
       #include <stdbool.h>

       #include <ldns/ldns.h>

       bool ldns_rr_list_cat(ldns_rr_list *left, const ldns_rr_list *right);

       bool ldns_rr_list_push_rr(ldns_rr_list *rr_list, const ldns_rr *rr);

       ldns_rr* ldns_rr_list_pop_rr(ldns_rr_list *rr_list);

DESCRIPTION
       ldns_rr_list_cat() concatenates two ldns_rr_lists together. This modifies *left (to extend it and add the pointers from *right).
              left: the leftside
              right: the rightside
              Returns a left with right concatenated to it

       ldns_rr_list_push_rr() pushes an rr to an rrlist.
              rr_list: the rr_list to push to
              rr: the rr to push
              Returns false on error, otherwise true

       ldns_rr_list_pop_rr() pops the last rr from an rrlist.
              rr_list: the rr_list to pop from
              Returns NULL if nothing to pop. Otherwise the popped RR
