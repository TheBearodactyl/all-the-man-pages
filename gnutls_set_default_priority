NAME
       gnutls_set_default_priority - API function

SYNOPSIS
       #include <gnutls/gnutls.h>

       int gnutls_set_default_priority(gnutls_session_t session);

ARGUMENTS
       gnutls_session_t session
                   is a gnutls_session_t type.

DESCRIPTION
       Sets  the  default  priority  on  the  ciphers,  key exchange methods, and macs. This is the recommended method of setting the defaults, in order to promote consistency between applications using
       GnuTLS, and to allow GnuTLS using applications to update settings in par with the library. For client applications which require maximum compatibility consider calling  gnutls_session_enable_com‐
       patibility_mode() after this function.

       For an application to specify additional options to priority string consider using gnutls_set_default_priority_append().

       To allow a user to override the defaults (e.g., when a user interface or configuration file is available), the functions gnutls_priority_set_direct() or gnutls_priority_set() can be used.

RETURNS
       GNUTLS_E_SUCCESS on success, or an error code.

SINCE
       2.1.4
