NAME
       xcb_ungrab_pointer - release the pointer

SYNOPSIS
       #include <xcb/xproto.h>

   Request function
       xcb_void_cookie_t xcb_ungrab_pointer(xcb_connection_t *conn, xcb_timestamp_t time);

REQUEST ARGUMENTS
       conn      The XCB connection to X11.

       time      Timestamp to avoid race conditions when running X over the network.

                 The pointer will not be released if time is earlier than the last-pointer-grab time or later than the current X server time.

DESCRIPTION
       Releases the pointer and any queued events if you actively grabbed the pointer before using xcb_grab_pointer, xcb_grab_button or within a normal button press.

       EnterNotify and LeaveNotify events are generated.

RETURN VALUE
       Returns an xcb_void_cookie_t. Errors (if any) have to be handled in the event loop.

       If you want to handle errors directly with xcb_request_check instead, use xcb_ungrab_pointer_checked. See xcb-requests(3) for details.

ERRORS
       This request does never generate any errors.
