SD_BUS_LIST_NAMES(3)           sd_bus_list_names          SD_BUS_LIST_NAMES(3)

NAME
       sd_bus_list_names - Retrieve information about registered names on a
       bus

SYNOPSIS
       #include <systemd/sd-bus.h>

       int sd_bus_list_names(sd_bus *bus, char ***acquired,
                             char ***activatable);

DESCRIPTION
       sd_bus_list_names() retrieves information about the registered names on
       a bus. If acquired is not NULL, this function calls
       org.freedesktop.DBus.ListNames[1] to retrieve the list of
       currently-owned names on the bus. If acquired is not NULL, the function
       calls org.freedesktop.DBus.ListActivableNames[2] to retrieve the list
       of all names on the bus that can be activated. Note that ownership of
       the arrays returned by sd_bus_list_names() in acquired and activatable
       is transferred to the caller and hence, the caller is responsible for
       freeing these arrays and their contents.

RETURN VALUE
       On success, sd_bus_list_names() returns a non-negative integer. On
       failure, it returns a negative errno-style error code.

   Errors
       Returned errors may indicate the following problems:

       -EINVAL
           bus or both acquired and activatable were NULL.

       -ENOPKG
           The bus cannot be resolved.

       -ECHILD
           The bus was created in a different process.

       -ENOMEM
           Memory allocation failed.

       -ENOTCONN
           The bus is not connected.

NOTES
       These APIs are implemented as a shared library, which can be compiled
       and linked to with the libsystemd pkg-config(1) file.
