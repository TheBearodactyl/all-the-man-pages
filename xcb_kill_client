NAME
       xcb_kill_client - kills a client

SYNOPSIS
       #include <xcb/xproto.h>

   Request function
       xcb_void_cookie_t xcb_kill_client(xcb_connection_t *conn, uint32_t resource);

REQUEST ARGUMENTS
       conn      The XCB connection to X11.

       resource  Any resource belonging to the client (for example a Window), used to identify the client connection.

                 The special value of XCB_KILL_ALL_TEMPORARY, the resources of all clients that have terminated in RetainTemporary (TODO) are destroyed.

DESCRIPTION
       Forces a close down of the client that created the specified resource.

RETURN VALUE
       Returns an xcb_void_cookie_t. Errors (if any) have to be handled in the event loop.
