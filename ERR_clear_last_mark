NAME
       ERR_set_mark, ERR_clear_last_mark, ERR_pop_to_mark - set mark, clear mark and pop errors until mark

SYNOPSIS
        #include <openssl/err.h>

        int ERR_set_mark(void);
        int ERR_pop_to_mark(void);
        int ERR_clear_last_mark(void);

DESCRIPTION
       ERR_set_mark() sets a mark on the current topmost error record if there is one.

       ERR_pop_to_mark() will pop the top of the error stack until a mark is found.  The mark is then removed.  If there is no mark, the whole stack is removed.

       ERR_clear_last_mark() removes the last mark added if there is one.

RETURN VALUES
       ERR_set_mark() returns 0 if the error stack is empty, otherwise 1.

       ERR_clear_last_mark() and ERR_pop_to_mark() return 0 if there was no mark in the error stack, which implies that the stack became empty, otherwise 1.
