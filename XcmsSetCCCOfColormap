NAME
       XcmsCCCOfColormap, XcmsSetCCCOfColormap - query and modify CCC of a colormap

SYNTAX
       XcmsCCC XcmsCCCOfColormap(Display *display, Colormap colormap);

       XcmsCCC XcmsSetCCCOfColormap(Display *display, Colormap colormap, XcmsCCC ccc);

ARGUMENTS
       display   Specifies the connection to the X server.

       ccc       Specifies the CCC.

       colormap  Specifies the colormap.

DESCRIPTION
       The XcmsCCCOfColormap function returns the CCC associated with the specified colormap.  Once obtained, the CCC attributes can be queried or modified.  Unless the CCC associated with the specified
       colormap is changed with XcmsSetCCCOfColormap, this CCC is used when the specified colormap is used as an argument to color functions.

       The XcmsSetCCCOfColormap function changes the CCC associated with the specified colormap.  It returns the CCC previously associated with the colormap.  If they are not used again in the  applica‐
       tion, CCCs should be freed by calling XcmsFreeCCC.  Several colormaps may share the same CCC without restriction; this includes the CCCs generated by Xlib with each colormap.  Xlib, however, cre‐
       ates a new CCC with each new colormap.
