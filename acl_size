NAME
     acl_size — get the size of the external representation of an ACL

LIBRARY
     Linux Access Control Lists library (libacl, -lacl).

SYNOPSIS
     #include <sys/types.h>
     #include <sys/acl.h>

     ssize_t
     acl_size(acl_t acl);

DESCRIPTION
     The acl_size() function return the size, in bytes, of the buffer required to hold the exportable, contiguous, persistent form of the ACL pointed to by the argument acl, when converted by
     acl_copy_ext().

     Any existing ACL entry descriptors that refer to entries in acl continue to refer to the same entries. Any existing ACL pointers that refer to the ACL referred to by acl continue to refer to the
     ACL. The order of ACL entries within acl remains unchanged.

RETURN VALUE
     On success, the acl_size() function returns the size in bytes of the contiguous, persistent form of the ACL. On error, a value of (ssize_t)-1 is returned and errno is set appropriately.

ERRORS
     If any of the following conditions occur, the acl_size() function returns a value of (ssize_t)-1 and sets errno to the corresponding value:

     [EINVAL]           The argument acl is not a valid pointer to an ACL.

STANDARDS
     IEEE Std 1003.1e draft 17 (“POSIX.1e”, abandoned)
