Unicode::Collate::CJK::Stroke(3perl)                                                 Perl Programmers Reference Guide                                                 Unicode::Collate::CJK::Stroke(3perl)

NAME
       Unicode::Collate::CJK::Stroke - weighting CJK Unified Ideographs for Unicode::Collate

SYNOPSIS
           use Unicode::Collate;
           use Unicode::Collate::CJK::Stroke;

           my $collator = Unicode::Collate->new(
               overrideCJK => \&Unicode::Collate::CJK::Stroke::weightStroke
           );

DESCRIPTION
       "Unicode::Collate::CJK::Stroke" provides "weightStroke()", that is adequate for "overrideCJK" of "Unicode::Collate" and makes tailoring of CJK Unified Ideographs in the order of CLDR's stroke
       ordering.

CAVEAT
       The stroke ordering includes some characters that are not CJK Unified Ideographs and can't utilize "weightStroke()" for collation. For them, use "entry" instead.
