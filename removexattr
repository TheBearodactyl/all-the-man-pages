removexattr(2)                System Calls Manual               removexattr(2)

NAME
       removexattr, lremovexattr, fremovexattr - remove an extended attribute

LIBRARY
       Standard C library (libc, -lc)

SYNOPSIS
       #include <sys/xattr.h>

       int removexattr(const char *path, const char *name);
       int lremovexattr(const char *path, const char *name);
       int fremovexattr(int fd, const char *name);

DESCRIPTION
       Extended attributes are name:value pairs associated with inodes (files,
       directories, symbolic links, etc.).  They are extensions to the  normal
       attributes  which  are  associated with all inodes in the system (i.e.,
       the stat(2) data).  A complete overview of extended attributes concepts
       can be found in xattr(7).

       removexattr() removes the extended attribute identified by name and as‐
       sociated with the given path in the filesystem.

       lremovexattr() is identical to removexattr(), except in the case  of  a
       symbolic  link,  where  the extended attribute is removed from the link
       itself, not the file that it refers to.

       fremovexattr() is identical to removexattr(), only the extended  attri‐
       bute  is  removed  from the open file referred to by fd (as returned by
       open(2)) in place of path.

       An extended attribute name is a null-terminated string.  The  name  in‐
       cludes  a  namespace  prefix; there may be several, disjoint namespaces
       associated with an individual inode.

RETURN VALUE
       On success, zero is returned.  On failure, -1 is returned and errno  is
       set to indicate the error.

ERRORS
       ENODATA
              The named attribute does not exist.

       ENOTSUP
              Extended  attributes are not supported by the filesystem, or are
              disabled.

       In addition, the errors documented in stat(2) can also occur.

STANDARDS
       Linux.

HISTORY
       Linux 2.4, glibc 2.3.
