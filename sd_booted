SD_BOOTED(3)                       sd_booted                      SD_BOOTED(3)

NAME
       sd_booted - Test whether the system is running the systemd init system

SYNOPSIS
       #include <systemd/sd-daemon.h>

       int sd_booted(void);

DESCRIPTION
       sd_booted() checks whether the system was booted up using the systemd
       init system.

RETURN VALUE
       On failure, this call returns a negative errno-style error code. If the
       system was booted up with systemd as init system, this call returns a
       positive return value, zero otherwise.

NOTES
       These APIs are implemented as a shared library, which can be compiled
       and linked to with the libsystemd pkg-config(1) file.

       Internally, this function checks whether the directory
       /run/systemd/system/ exists. A simple check like this can also be
       implemented trivially in shell or any other language.
