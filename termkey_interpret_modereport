NAME
       termkey_interpret_modereport - interpret opaque mode report data

SYNOPSIS
       #include <termkey.h>

       TermKeyResult termkey_interpret_modereport(TermKey *tk, const TermKeyKey *key,
           int *initial, int *mode, int *value);

       Link with -ltermkey.

DESCRIPTION
       termkey_interpret_modereport()  fills  in variables in the passed pointers according to the mode report event found in key. It should be called if termkey_getkey(3) or similar have returned a key
       event with the type of TERMKEY_TYPE_MODEREPORT.

       Any pointer may instead be given as NULL to not return that value.

       The initial variable will be filled with 0 for an ANSI mode report, or '?' for a DEC mode report. The mode variable will be filled with the number of the mode, and value will be filled  with  the
       value from the report.

RETURN VALUE
       If passed a key event of the type TERMKEY_TYPE_MODEREPORT, this function will return TERMKEY_RES_KEY and will affect the variables whose pointers were passed in, as described above.

       For other event types it will return TERMKEY_RES_NONE, and its effects on any variables whose pointers were passed in, are undefined.
