NAME
       X509_get_pubkey, X509_get0_pubkey, X509_set_pubkey, X509_get_X509_PUBKEY, X509_REQ_get_pubkey, X509_REQ_get0_pubkey, X509_REQ_set_pubkey, X509_REQ_get_X509_PUBKEY - get or set certificate or
       certificate request public key

SYNOPSIS
        #include <openssl/x509.h>

        EVP_PKEY *X509_get_pubkey(X509 *x);
        EVP_PKEY *X509_get0_pubkey(const X509 *x);
        int X509_set_pubkey(X509 *x, EVP_PKEY *pkey);
        X509_PUBKEY *X509_get_X509_PUBKEY(const X509 *x);

        EVP_PKEY *X509_REQ_get_pubkey(X509_REQ *req);
        EVP_PKEY *X509_REQ_get0_pubkey(X509_REQ *req);
        int X509_REQ_set_pubkey(X509_REQ *x, EVP_PKEY *pkey);
        X509_PUBKEY *X509_REQ_get_X509_PUBKEY(X509_REQ *x);

DESCRIPTION
       X509_get_pubkey() attempts to decode the public key for certificate x. If successful it returns the public key as an EVP_PKEY pointer with its reference count incremented: this means the returned
       key must be freed up after use. X509_get0_pubkey() is similar except it does not increment the reference count of the returned EVP_PKEY so it must not be freed up after use.

       X509_get_X509_PUBKEY() returns an internal pointer to the X509_PUBKEY structure which encodes the certificate of x. The returned value must not be freed up after use.

       X509_set_pubkey() attempts to set the public key for certificate x to pkey. The key pkey should be freed up after use.

       X509_REQ_get_pubkey(), X509_REQ_get0_pubkey(), X509_REQ_set_pubkey() and X509_REQ_get_X509_PUBKEY() are similar but operate on certificate request req.

NOTES
       The first time a public key is decoded the EVP_PKEY structure is cached in the certificate or certificate request itself. Subsequent calls return the cached structure with its reference count
       incremented to improve performance.

RETURN VALUES
       X509_get_pubkey(), X509_get0_pubkey(), X509_get_X509_PUBKEY(), X509_REQ_get_pubkey() and X509_REQ_get_X509_PUBKEY() return a public key or NULL if an error occurred.

       X509_set_pubkey() and X509_REQ_set_pubkey() return 1 for success and 0 for failure.
