NAME
       ldns_buffer_remaining_at, ldns_buffer_remaining, ldns_buffer_available_at, ldns_buffer_available, ldns_buffer_status, ldns_buffer_status_ok - check buffer status

SYNOPSIS
       #include <stdint.h>
       #include <stdbool.h>

       #include <ldns/ldns.h>

       size_t ldns_buffer_remaining_at(const ldns_buffer *buffer, size_t at);

       size_t ldns_buffer_remaining(const ldns_buffer *buffer);

       int ldns_buffer_available_at(const ldns_buffer *buffer, size_t at, size_t count);

       int ldns_buffer_available(const ldns_buffer *buffer, size_t count);

       ldns_status ldns_buffer_status(const ldns_buffer *buffer);

       bool ldns_buffer_status_ok(const ldns_buffer *buffer);

DESCRIPTION
       ldns_buffer_remaining_at() returns the number of bytes remaining between the indicated position and the limit.
              buffer: the buffer
              at: indicated position
              Returns number of bytes

       ldns_buffer_remaining() returns the number of bytes remaining between the buffer's position and limit.
              buffer: the buffer
              Returns the number of bytes

       ldns_buffer_available_at() checks if the buffer has at least COUNT more bytes available.  Before reading or writing the caller needs to ensure enough space is available!
              buffer: the buffer
              at: indicated position
              count: how much is available
              Returns true or false (as int?)

       ldns_buffer_available() checks if the buffer has count bytes available at the current position
              buffer: the buffer
              count: how much is available
              Returns true or false (as int?)

       ldns_buffer_status() returns the status of the buffer \param[in] buffer
              Returns the status

       ldns_buffer_status_ok() returns true if the status of the buffer is LDNS_STATUS_OK, false otherwise
              buffer: the buffer
              Returns true or false
