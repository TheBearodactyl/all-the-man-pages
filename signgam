DESCRIPTION
       For the definition of the Gamma function, see tgamma(3).

       The lgamma(), lgammaf(), and lgammal()  functions  return  the  natural
       logarithm of the absolute value of the Gamma function.  The sign of the
       Gamma function is returned in the external integer signgam declared  in
       <math.h>.  It is 1 when the Gamma function is positive or zero, -1 when
       it is negative.

       Since using a constant location signgam is not thread-safe,  the  func‐
       tions  lgamma_r(),  lgammaf_r(),  and lgammal_r() have been introduced;
       they return the sign via the argument signp.

RETURN VALUE
       On success, these functions return the natural logarithm of Gamma(x).

       If x is a NaN, a NaN is returned.

       If x is 1 or 2, +0 is returned.

       If x is positive infinity or negative infinity,  positive  infinity  is
       returned.

       If  x  is a nonpositive integer, a pole error occurs, and the functions
       return +HUGE_VAL, +HUGE_VALF, or +HUGE_VALL, respectively.

       If the result overflows, a range error occurs, and the functions return
       HUGE_VAL, HUGE_VALF, or HUGE_VALL, respectively, with the correct math‐
       ematical sign.

ERRORS
       See math_error(7) for information on how to determine whether an  error
       has occurred when calling these functions.

       The following errors can occur:

       Pole error: x is a nonpositive integer
              errno  is set to ERANGE (but see BUGS).  A divide-by-zero float‐
              ing-point exception (FE_DIVBYZERO) is raised.

       Range error: result overflow
              errno is set to ERANGE.  An  overflow  floating-point  exception
              (FE_OVERFLOW) is raised.

HISTORY
       lgamma()
       lgammaf()
       lgammal()
              C99, POSIX.1-2001.

       signgam
              POSIX.1-2001.

       lgamma_r()
       lgammaf_r()
       lgammal_r()
              None.

BUGS
       In  glibc  2.9  and  earlier, when a pole error occurs, errno is set to
       EDOM; instead of the POSIX-mandated ERANGE.  Since  glibc  2.10,  glibc
       does the right thing.
