NAME
       ares_parse_aaaa_reply - Parse a reply to a DNS query of type AAAA

SYNOPSIS
       #include <ares.h>

       int ares_parse_aaaa_reply(const unsigned char *abuf, int alen,
                                 struct hostent **host,
                                 struct ares_addr6ttl *addrttls, int *naddrttls);

DESCRIPTION
       The  ares_parse_aaaa_reply  function  parses the response to a query of type AAAA into a struct hostent and/or an array of struct ares_addr6ttl.  The parameters abuf and alen give the contents of
       the response.  The result is stored in allocated memory and a pointer to it stored into the variable pointed to by host, if host is nonnull.  It is the caller's responsibility to free the result‚Äê
       ing host structure using ares_free_hostent(3) when it is no longer needed.

       If  addrttls and naddrttls are both nonnull, then up to *naddrttls struct ares_addr6ttl records are stored in the array pointed to by addrttls, and then *naddrttls is set to the number of records
       so stored.  Note that the memory for these records is supplied by the caller.

RETURN VALUES
       ares_parse_aaaa_reply can return any of the following values:

       ARES_SUCCESS   The response was successfully parsed.

       ARES_EBADRESP  The response was malformatted.

       ARES_ENODATA   The response did not contain an answer to the query.

       ARES_ENOMEM    Memory was exhausted.
