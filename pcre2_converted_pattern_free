NAME
       PCRE2 - Perl-compatible regular expressions (revised API)

SYNOPSIS

       #include <pcre2.h>

       void pcre2_converted_pattern_free(PCRE2_UCHAR *converted_pattern);

DESCRIPTION

       This  function  is  part  of  an experimental set of pattern conversion
       functions.  It frees the memory occupied by a  converted  pattern  that
       was  obtained  by  calling  pcre2_pattern_convert() with arguments that
       caused it to place the converted pattern into newly obtained heap  mem‐
       ory.  If the argument is NULL, the function returns immediately without
       doing anything.

       The pattern conversion functions are described in the pcre2convert doc‐
       umentation.
