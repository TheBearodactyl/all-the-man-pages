NAME
       gnutls_x509_trust_list_add_crls - API function

SYNOPSIS
       #include <gnutls/x509.h>

       int gnutls_x509_trust_list_add_crls(gnutls_x509_trust_list_t list, const gnutls_x509_crl_t * crl_list, unsigned crl_size, unsigned int flags, unsigned int verification_flags);

ARGUMENTS
       gnutls_x509_trust_list_t list
                   The list

       const gnutls_x509_crl_t * crl_list
                   A list of CRLs

       unsigned crl_size
                   The length of the CRL list

       unsigned int flags
                   flags from gnutls_trust_list_flags_t

       unsigned int verification_flags
                   gnutls_certificate_verify_flags if flags specifies GNUTLS_TL_VERIFY_CRL

DESCRIPTION
       This function will add the given certificate revocation lists to the trusted list. The CRLs in  crl_list must not be deinitialized during the lifetime of  list .

       This  function  must be called after gnutls_x509_trust_list_add_cas() to allow verifying the CRLs for validity. If the flag GNUTLS_TL_NO_DUPLICATES is given, then the final CRL list will not con‐
       tain duplicate entries.

       If the flag GNUTLS_TL_NO_DUPLICATES is given, gnutls_x509_trust_list_deinit() must be called with parameter  all being 1.

       If flag GNUTLS_TL_VERIFY_CRL is given the CRLs will be verified before being added, and if verification fails, they will be skipped.

RETURNS
       The number of added elements is returned; that includes duplicate entries.

SINCE
       3.0
