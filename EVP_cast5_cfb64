NAME
       EVP_cast5_cbc, EVP_cast5_cfb, EVP_cast5_cfb64, EVP_cast5_ecb, EVP_cast5_ofb - EVP CAST cipher

SYNOPSIS
        #include <openssl/evp.h>

        const EVP_CIPHER *EVP_cast5_cbc(void);
        const EVP_CIPHER *EVP_cast5_cfb(void);
        const EVP_CIPHER *EVP_cast5_cfb64(void);
        const EVP_CIPHER *EVP_cast5_ecb(void);
        const EVP_CIPHER *EVP_cast5_ofb(void);

DESCRIPTION
       The CAST encryption algorithm for EVP.

       This is a variable key length cipher.

       EVP_cast5_cbc(), EVP_cast5_ecb(), EVP_cast5_cfb(), EVP_cast5_cfb64(), EVP_cast5_ofb()
           CAST encryption algorithm in CBC, ECB, CFB and OFB modes respectively.

RETURN VALUES
       These functions return an EVP_CIPHER structure that contains the implementation of the symmetric cipher. See EVP_CIPHER_meth_new(3) for details of the EVP_CIPHER structure.
