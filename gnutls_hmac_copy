NAME
       gnutls_hmac_copy - API function

SYNOPSIS
       #include <gnutls/crypto.h>

       gnutls_hmac_hd_t gnutls_hmac_copy(gnutls_hmac_hd_t handle);

ARGUMENTS
       gnutls_hmac_hd_t handle
                   is a gnutls_hmac_hd_t type

DESCRIPTION
       This  function will create a copy of MAC context, containing all its current state. Copying contexts for MACs registered using gnutls_crypto_register_mac() is not supported and will always result
       in an error. In addition to that, some of the MAC implementations do not support this operation. Applications should check the return value and provide a proper fallback.

RETURNS
       new MAC context or NULL in case of an error.

SINCE
       3.6.9
