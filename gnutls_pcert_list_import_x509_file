NAME
       gnutls_pcert_list_import_x509_file - API function

SYNOPSIS
       #include <gnutls/abstract.h>

       int gnutls_pcert_list_import_x509_file(gnutls_pcert_st * pcert_list, unsigned * pcert_list_size, const char * file, gnutls_x509_crt_fmt_t format, gnutls_pin_callback_t pin_fn, void * pin_fn_user‐
       data, unsigned int flags);

ARGUMENTS
       gnutls_pcert_st * pcert_list
                   The structures to store the certificates; must not contain initialized gnutls_pcert_st structures.

       unsigned * pcert_list_size
                   Initially must hold the maximum number of certs. It will be updated with the number of certs available.

       const char * file
                   A file or supported URI with the certificates to load

       gnutls_x509_crt_fmt_t format
                   GNUTLS_X509_FMT_DER or GNUTLS_X509_FMT_PEM if a file is given

       gnutls_pin_callback_t pin_fn
                   a PIN callback if not globally set

       void * pin_fn_userdata
                   parameter for the PIN callback

       unsigned int flags
                   zero or flags from gnutls_certificate_import_flags

DESCRIPTION
       This convenience function will import a certificate chain from  the  given  file  or  supported  URI  to  gnutls_pcert_st  structures.  The  structures  must  be  deinitialized  afterwards  using
       gnutls_pcert_deinit().

       This function will always return a sorted certificate chain.

RETURNS
       On success, GNUTLS_E_SUCCESS (0) is returned, otherwise a negative error value; if the  pcert list doesn't have enough space GNUTLS_E_SHORT_MEMORY_BUFFER will be returned.

SINCE
       3.6.3
