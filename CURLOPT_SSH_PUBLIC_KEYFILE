NAME
       CURLOPT_SSH_PUBLIC_KEYFILE - public key file for SSH auth

SYNOPSIS
       #include <curl/curl.h>

       CURLcode curl_easy_setopt(CURL *handle, CURLOPT_SSH_PUBLIC_KEYFILE,
                                 char *filename);

DESCRIPTION
       Pass  a char * pointing to a filename for your public key. If not used, libcurl defaults to $HOME/.ssh/id_dsa.pub if the HOME environment variable is set, and just "id_dsa.pub" in the current di‚Äê
       rectory if HOME is not set.

       If NULL (or an empty string) is passed, libcurl will pass no public key to libssh2, which then tries to compute it from the private key.  This is known to work with libssh2 1.4.0+ linked  against
       OpenSSL.

       The application does not have to keep the string around after setting this option.

DEFAULT
       NULL

PROTOCOLS
       SFTP and SCP

EXAMPLE
       CURL *curl = curl_easy_init();
       if(curl) {
         curl_easy_setopt(curl, CURLOPT_URL, "sftp://example.com/file");
         curl_easy_setopt(curl, CURLOPT_SSH_PUBLIC_KEYFILE,
                          "/home/clarkkent/.ssh/id_rsa.pub");
         ret = curl_easy_perform(curl);
         curl_easy_cleanup(curl);
       }

AVAILABILITY
       The "" trick was added in 7.26.0

RETURN VALUE
       Returns CURLE_OK if the option is supported, CURLE_UNKNOWN_OPTION if not, or CURLE_OUT_OF_MEMORY if there was insufficient heap space.
