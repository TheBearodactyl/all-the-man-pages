NAME
       TIFFWriteRawStrip - write a strip of raw data to an open TIFF file

SYNOPSIS
          #include <tiffio.h>

       tsize_t TIFFWriteRawStrip(TIFF *tif, tstrip_t strip, tdata_t buf, tsize_t size)

DESCRIPTION
       Append size bytes of raw data to the specified strip.

NOTES
       The  strip number must be valid according to the current settings of the ImageLength and RowsPerStrip tags.  An image may be dynamically grown by increasing the value of ImageLength prior to each
       call to TIFFWriteRawStrip().

RETURN VALUES
       -1 is returned if an error occurred.  Otherwise, the value of size is returned.

DIAGNOSTICS
       All error messages are directed to the TIFFErrorExtR() routine.

       %s: File not open for writing:
          The file was opened for reading, not writing.

       Can not write scanlines to a tiled image:
          The image is assumed to be organized in tiles because the TileWidth and TileLength tags have been set with TIFFSetField().

       %s: Must set "ImageWidth" before writing data:
          The imageâ€™s width has not be set before the first write.  See TIFFSetField() for information on how to do this.

       %s: Must set "PlanarConfiguration" before writing data:
          The organization of data has not be defined before the first write.  See TIFFSetField() for information on how to do this.

       %s: No space for strip arrays":
          There was not enough space for the arrays that hold strip offsets and byte counts.

       %s: Strip %d out of range, max %d:
          The specified strip is not a valid strip according to the currently specified image dimensions.
