NAME
       capng_setpid - set working pid

SYNOPSIS
       #include <cap-ng.h>

       void capng_setpid(int pid);

DESCRIPTION
       capng_pid sets the working pid for capabilities operations. This is useful if you want to get the capabilities of a different process.

NOTES
       If your process calls fork , then the child process will still have the pid of the parent process stored in libcap-ng's internal data. It is disallowed to do any kind of setcap operations because
       you would be crossing process boundaries. To correct this, if your program links against pthreads, then libcap-ng will use the pthread_atfork function (as a weak symbol) to reset the pid informa‚Äê
       tion to the new process automatically. You are not required to link against pthreads. You can call capng_setpid and adjust the stored pid manually.

RETURN VALUE
       None.
