NAME
       ldns_rr_rdf, ldns_rr_owner, ldns_rr_rd_count, ldns_rr_ttl, ldns_rr_get_class - access rdata fields on ldns_rr

SYNOPSIS
       #include <stdint.h>
       #include <stdbool.h>

       #include <ldns/ldns.h>

       ldns_rdf* ldns_rr_rdf(const ldns_rr *rr, size_t nr);

       ldns_rdf* ldns_rr_owner(const ldns_rr *rr);

       size_t ldns_rr_rd_count(const ldns_rr *rr);

       uint32_t ldns_rr_ttl(const ldns_rr *rr);

       ldns_rr_class ldns_rr_get_class(const ldns_rr *rr);

DESCRIPTION
       ldns_rr_rdf() returns the rdata field member counter.
              *rr: rr to operate on
              nr: the number of the rdf to return
              Returns ldns_rdf *

       ldns_rr_owner() returns the owner name of an rr structure.
              *rr: rr to operate on
              Returns ldns_rdf *

       ldns_rr_rd_count() returns the rd_count of an rr structure.
              *rr: the rr to read from
              Returns the rd count of the rr

       ldns_rr_ttl() returns the ttl of an rr structure.
              *rr: the rr to read from
              Returns the ttl of the rr

       ldns_rr_get_class() returns the class of the rr.
              *rr: the rr to read from
              Returns the class of the rr
