NAME
       libssh2_channel_receive_window_adjust2 - adjust the channel window

SYNOPSIS
       #include <libssh2.h>

       int libssh2_channel_receive_window_adjust2(LIBSSH2_CHANNEL * channel,
                                              unsigned long adjustment,
                                              unsigned char force,
                                              unsigned int *window);

DESCRIPTION
       Adjust  the  receive  window for a channel by adjustment bytes. If the amount to be adjusted is less than LIBSSH2_CHANNEL_MINADJUST and force is 0 the adjustment amount will be queued for a later
       packet.

       This function stores the new size of the receive window (as understood by remote end) in the variable 'window' points to.

RETURN VALUE
       Return 0 on success and a negative value on error. If used in non-blocking mode it will return LIBSSH2_ERROR_EAGAIN when it would otherwise block.

ERRORS
AVAILABILITY
       Added in libssh2 1.1 since the previous API has deficiencies.
