NAME
       gnutls_dh_set_prime_bits - API function

SYNOPSIS
       #include <gnutls/gnutls.h>

       void gnutls_dh_set_prime_bits(gnutls_session_t session, unsigned int bits);

ARGUMENTS
       gnutls_session_t session
                   is a gnutls_session_t type.

       unsigned int bits
                   is the number of bits

DESCRIPTION
       This  function  sets  the number of bits, for use in a Diffie-Hellman key exchange.  This is used both in DH ephemeral and DH anonymous cipher suites.  This will set the minimum size of the prime
       that will be used for the handshake.

       In the client side it sets the minimum accepted number of bits.  If a server sends a prime with less bits than that GNUTLS_E_DH_PRIME_UNACCEPTABLE will be returned by the handshake.

       Note that this function will warn via the audit log for value that are believed to be weak.

       The function has no effect in server side.

       Note that since 3.1.7 this function is deprecated. The minimum number of bits is set by the priority string level.  Also this function must be called after gnutls_priority_set_direct() or the set
       value may be overridden by the selected priority options.
