NAME
       sd_event_set_signal_exit - Automatically leave event loop on SIGINT and
       SIGTERM

SYNOPSIS
       #include <systemd/sd-event.h>

       int sd_event_set_signal_exit(sd_event *event, int b);

DESCRIPTION
       sd_event_set_signal_exit() may be used to ensure the event loop
       terminates once a SIGINT or SIGTERM signal is received. It is a
       convencience wrapper around invocations of sd_event_add_signal(3) for
       both signals. The two signals are automatically added to the calling
       thread's signal mask (if a program is multi-threaded care should be
       taken to either invoke this function before the first thread is started
       or to manually block the two signals process-wide first).

       If the parameter b is specified as true, the event loop will terminate
       on SIGINT and SIGTERM. If specified as false, it will no longer. When
       this functionality is turned off the calling thread's signal mask is
       restored to match the state before it was turned on, for the two
       signals. By default the two signals are not handled by the event loop,
       and Linux' default signal handling for them is in effect.

       It's customary for UNIX programs to exit on either of these two
       signals, hence it's typically a good idea to enable this functionality
       for the main event loop of a program.

RETURN VALUE
       sd_event_set_signal_exit() returns a positive non-zero value when the
       setting was successfully changed. It returns a zero when the specified
       setting was already in effect. On failure, it returns a negative
       errno-style error code.

   Errors
       Returned errors may indicate the following problems:

       -ECHILD
           The event loop has been created in a different process.

       -EINVAL
           The passed event loop object was invalid.

NOTES
       These APIs are implemented as a shared library, which can be compiled
       and linked to with the libsystemd pkg-config(1) file.
