NAME
       XcupStoreColors - initialize shareable colormap entries at specific locations

SYNOPSIS
       cc [ flag ... ] file ... -lXext [ library ... ]
       #include <X11/extensions/Xcup.h>

       Status XcupStoreColors(Display *display, Colormap colormap,
              XColor *colors_in_out, int ncolors);

ARGUMENTS
       display   Specifies the connection to the X server

       colormap  Specifies the colormap

       colors_in_out
                 Specifies and returns the values actually used in the colormap

       ncolors   Specifies the number of items in colors_in_out

DESCRIPTION
       The  XcupStoreColors  function changes the colormap entries of the pixel values in the pixel members of the XColor structures. The colormap entries are allocated as if an AllocColor has been used
       instead, i.e. the colors are read-only (shareable).  XcupStoreColors returns the number of colors that were successfully allocated in the colormap.

       A Value error is generated if a pixel is not a valid index into the colormap. A BadMatch error is generated if the colormap does not belong to a GrayScale, PseudoColor, or DirectColor visual.

       Applications which allocate many colors in a screen's default colormap, e.g.  a color-cube or a gray-ramp, should allocate them with XCupStoreColors.  By using XCupStoreColors the colors will  be
       allocated shareable (read-only) and any other application which allocates the same color will share that color cell.
