NAME
       gnutls_certificate_set_verify_function - API function

SYNOPSIS
       #include <gnutls/gnutls.h>

       void gnutls_certificate_set_verify_function(gnutls_certificate_credentials_t cred, gnutls_certificate_verify_function * func);

ARGUMENTS
       gnutls_certificate_credentials_t cred
                   is a gnutls_certificate_credentials_t type.

       gnutls_certificate_verify_function * func
                   is the callback function

DESCRIPTION
       This function sets a callback to be called when peer's certificate has been received in order to verify it on receipt rather than doing after the handshake is completed.

       The callback's function prototype is: int (*callback)(gnutls_session_t);

       If  the  callback  function  is provided then gnutls will call it, in the handshake, just after the certificate message has been received.  To verify or obtain the certificate the gnutls_certifi‐
       cate_verify_peers2(), gnutls_certificate_type_get(), gnutls_certificate_get_peers() functions can be used.

       The callback function should return 0 for the handshake to continue or non-zero to terminate.

SINCE
       2.10.0
