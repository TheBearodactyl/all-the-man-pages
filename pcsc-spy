PCSC-SPY(1)                       PC/SC lite                       PCSC-SPY(1)

NAME
       pcsc-spy - A PC/SC spy command

SYNOPSIS
       pcsc-spy [-n|--nocolor] [-d|--diffable] [-h|--help] [-v|--version]
       [-t|--thread] [fifo_filename]

DESCRIPTION
       pcsc-spy displays PC/SC calls of an application. It must be used with
       the libpcscspy.so library.

       To be able to spy the PC/SC layer, the application flow must be
       modified so that all PC/SC calls are redirected. Two options are
       available:

       - the application is linked with libpcsclite.so.1
       - the application loads the libpcsclite.so.1 library using dlopen(3)

OPTIONS
       -d, --diffable
           Remove the variable parts (like handler values) from the output so
           that two execution can be more easily compared.

       -h, --help
           Display a short help text.

       -n, --nocolor
           Disable the output colorization (if you want redirect the output in
           a file for example).

       -v, --version
           Print the version of the pcsc-spy program plus a copyright, a list
           of authors.

       -t, --thread
           Add a thread number before each line of log to identify the calls
           from the same threads.

EXAMPLES
   Applications linked with libpcsclite.so.1
       We will use the standard "LD_PRELOAD" loader option to load our spying
       library.

       Example:

        LD_PRELOAD=/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libpcscspy.so pcsc_scan

   Application loading libpcsclite.so.1
       This is the case for the PC/SC wrappers like pyscard (for Python) and
       pcsc-perl (for Perl). The LD_PRELOAD mechanism can't be used. Instead
       we replace the libpcsclite.so.1 library by the spying one.

       You may use install_spy.sh and uninstall_spy.sh to install and
       uninstall the spying library.

       Using the spying library without pcsc-spy is not a problem but has side
       effects:

       - a line "libpcsclite_nospy.so.1: cannot open shared object file: No
       such file or directory" will be displayed

       - some CPU time will be lost because of the PC/SC calls redirection

   Starting the spy tool
        pcsc-spy

       If a command argument is passed we use it instead of the default
       ~/pcsc-spy FIFO file. It is then possible to record an execution log
       and use pcsc-spy multiple times on the same log.

       To create the log file just do:

        mkfifo ~/pcsc-spy
        cat ~/pcsc-spy > logfile

       and run your PC/SC application.

FILES
       ~/pcsc-spy FIFO file is used by libpcsclite.so.1 to send the raw log
       lines
