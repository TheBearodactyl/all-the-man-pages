EVP_PKEY_TODATA(3ssl)                                                                             OpenSSL                                                                            EVP_PKEY_TODATA(3ssl)

NAME
       EVP_PKEY_todata, EVP_PKEY_export - functions to return keys as an array of key parameters

SYNOPSIS
        #include <openssl/evp.h>

        int EVP_PKEY_todata(const EVP_PKEY *pkey, int selection, OSSL_PARAM **params);
        int EVP_PKEY_export(const EVP_PKEY *pkey, int selection,
                            OSSL_CALLBACK *export_cb, void *export_cbarg);

DESCRIPTION
       The functions described here are used to extract EVP_PKEY key values as an array of OSSL_PARAM(3).

       EVP_PKEY_todata() extracts values from a key pkey using the selection.  selection is described in "Selections" in EVP_PKEY_fromdata(3).  OSSL_PARAM_free(3) should be used to free the returned
       parameters in *params.

       EVP_PKEY_export() is similiar to EVP_PKEY_todata() but uses a callback export_cb that gets passed the value of export_cbarg.  See openssl-core.h(7) for more information about the callback. Note
       that the OSSL_PARAM(3) array that is passed to the callback is not persistent after the callback returns. The user must preserve the items of interest, or use EVP_PKEY_todata() if persistence is
       required.

NOTES
       These functions only work with key management methods coming from a provider.  This is the mirror function to EVP_PKEY_fromdata(3).

RETURN VALUES
       EVP_PKEY_todata() and EVP_PKEY_export() return 1 for success and 0 for failure.
