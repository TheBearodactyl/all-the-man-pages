NAME
       CONF_modules_free, CONF_modules_finish, CONF_modules_unload - OpenSSL configuration cleanup functions

SYNOPSIS
        #include <openssl/conf.h>

        void CONF_modules_finish(void);
        void CONF_modules_unload(int all);

       The following functions have been deprecated since OpenSSL 1.1.0, and can be hidden entirely by defining OPENSSL_API_COMPAT with a suitable version value, see openssl_user_macros(7):

        void CONF_modules_free(void);

DESCRIPTION
       CONF_modules_free() closes down and frees up all memory allocated by all configuration modules.  Normally, in versions of OpenSSL prior to 1.1.0, applications called CONF_modules_free() at exit
       to tidy up any configuration performed.

       CONF_modules_finish() calls each configuration modules finish handler to free up any configuration that module may have performed.

       CONF_modules_unload() finishes and unloads configuration modules. If all is set to 0 only modules loaded from DSOs will be unloads. If all is 1 all modules, including built-in modules will be
       unloaded.

RETURN VALUES
       None of the functions return a value.

HISTORY
       CONF_modules_free() was deprecated in OpenSSL 1.1.0; do not use it.  For more information see OPENSSL_init_crypto(3).
