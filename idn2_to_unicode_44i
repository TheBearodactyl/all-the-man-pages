NAME
       idn2_to_unicode_44i - API function

SYNOPSIS
       #include <idn2.h>

       int idn2_to_unicode_44i(const uint32_t * in, size_t inlen, uint32_t * out, size_t * outlen, int flags);

ARGUMENTS
       const uint32_t * in
                   Input array with UTF-32 code points.

       size_t inlen
                   number of code points of input array

       uint32_t * out
                   output array with UTF-32 code points.

       size_t * outlen
                   on input, maximum size of output array with UTF-32 code points, on exit, actual size of output array with UTF-32 code points.

       int flags   Currently unused.

DESCRIPTION
       The  ToUnicode  operation takes a sequence of UTF-32 code points that make up one domain label and returns a sequence of UTF-32 code points. If the input sequence is a label in ACE form, then the
       result is an equivalent internationalized label that is not in ACE form, otherwise the original sequence is returned unaltered.

        output may be NULL to test lookup of  input without allocating memory.

SINCE
       2.0.0
