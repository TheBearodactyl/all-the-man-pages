NAME
       gnutls_pkcs11_obj_list_import_url3 - API function

SYNOPSIS
       #include <gnutls/pkcs11.h>

       int gnutls_pkcs11_obj_list_import_url3(gnutls_pkcs11_obj_t * p_list, unsigned int * n_list, const char * url, unsigned int flags);

ARGUMENTS
       gnutls_pkcs11_obj_t * p_list
                   An uninitialized object list (may be NULL)

       unsigned int * n_list
                   Initially should hold the maximum size of the list. Will contain the actual size.

       const char * url
                   A PKCS 11 url identifying a set of objects

       unsigned int flags
                   Or sequence of GNUTLS_PKCS11_OBJ_* flags

DESCRIPTION
       This function will initialize and set values to an object list by using all objects identified by a PKCS 11 URL.

       This  function  will enumerate all the objects specified by the PKCS11 URL provided. It expects an already allocated  p_list which has * n_list elements, and that value will be updated to the ac‐
       tual number of present objects. The
        p_list objects will be initialized and set by this function.  To obtain a list of all available objects use a  url of 'pkcs11:'.

       All returned objects must be deinitialized using gnutls_pkcs11_obj_deinit().

       The  supported  in  this  function   flags  are  GNUTLS_PKCS11_OBJ_FLAG_LOGIN,   GNUTLS_PKCS11_OBJ_FLAG_LOGIN_SO,   GNUTLS_PKCS11_OBJ_FLAG_PRESENT_IN_TRUSTED_MODULE,   GNUTLS_PKCS11_OBJ_FLAG_CRT,
       GNUTLS_PKCS11_OBJ_FLAG_PUBKEY,  GNUTLS_PKCS11_OBJ_FLAG_PRIVKEY,  GNUTLS_PKCS11_OBJ_FLAG_WITH_PRIVKEY,  GNUTLS_PKCS11_OBJ_FLAG_MARK_CA,  GNUTLS_PKCS11_OBJ_FLAG_MARK_TRUSTED,  and  since  3.5.1 the
       GNUTLS_PKCS11_OBJ_FLAG_OVERWRITE_TRUSTMOD_EXT.

       On versions of GnuTLS prior to 3.4.0 the equivalent function was gnutls_pkcs11_obj_list_import_url(). That is also available on this version as a macro which maps to this function.

RETURNS
       On success, GNUTLS_E_SUCCESS (0) is returned, otherwise a negative error value.

SINCE
       3.4.0
