NAME
       DSA_generate_key - generate DSA key pair

SYNOPSIS
        #include <openssl/dsa.h>

       The following functions have been deprecated since OpenSSL 3.0, and can be hidden entirely by defining OPENSSL_API_COMPAT with a suitable version value, see openssl_user_macros(7):

        int DSA_generate_key(DSA *a);

DESCRIPTION
       All of the functions described on this page are deprecated.  Applications should instead use EVP_PKEY_keygen_init(3) and EVP_PKEY_keygen(3) as described in EVP_PKEY-DSA(7).

       DSA_generate_key() expects a to contain DSA parameters. It generates a new key pair and stores it in a->pub_key and a->priv_key.

       The random generator must be seeded prior to calling DSA_generate_key().  If the automatic seeding or reseeding of the OpenSSL CSPRNG fails due to external circumstances (see RAND(7)), the
       operation will fail.

RETURN VALUES
       DSA_generate_key() returns 1 on success, 0 otherwise.  The error codes can be obtained by ERR_get_error(3).

SEE ALSO
       DSA_new(3), ERR_get_error(3), RAND_bytes(3), DSA_generate_parameters_ex(3)

HISTORY
       This function was deprecated in OpenSSL 3.0.
