DESCRIPTION
       plasmaengineexplorer is a graphical tool allowing developers to test
       Plasma data engines without writing a Plasma applet.

       If no options are given, it will start without any data engine
       selected. The required data engine can be selected from a drop-down
       list.

       Only installed data engines will be found.  kbuildsycoca4 may need to
       be run for newly-installed data engines to be found.

OPTIONS
       -v, --version

           Displays version information.

       -h, --help

           Displays this help.

       --list pixels

           Displays a list of known engines and their descriptions.

       --height

           Sets the height of the window, in pixels.

       --width pixels

           Sets the width of the window, in pixels.

       -x pixels

           Sets the x (horizontal) co-ordinate of the top left corner of the
           window, in pixels.

       -y pixels

           Sets the y (vertical) co-ordinate of the top left corner of the
           window, in pixels.

       --engine data engine

           Start plasmaengineexplorer with the given data engine selected.
           data engine is the internal name of the data engine given by the
           X-KDE-PluginInfo-Name key of the desktop file.

       --source data engine

           Only valid in conjunction with --engine. Requests a specific source
           from the data engine when plasmaengineexplorer is started.

       --interval time

           Sets the default update interval for requested sources to time
           milliseconds. If not set, the source will update on demand (for
           some sources, this will be when new data is available).

           If --source is specified, this is the update interval that will be
           used when requesting that source.

       --app application

           Only show engines associated with the parent application; maps to
           the X-KDE-ParentApp entry in the DataEngine's .desktop file.

SEE ALSO
       More detailed user documentation is available from help:/plasma-desktop
       (either enter this URL into Konqueror, or run khelpcenter
       help:/plasma-desktop).

EXAMPLES
       Load the time data engine, showing the local time and updating every
       second:

           plasmaengineexplorer --engine time --source Local --interval 1000
