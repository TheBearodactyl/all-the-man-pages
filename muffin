NAME
       MUFFIN - Clutter based compositing GTK2 Window Manager

SYNOPSIS
       MUFFIN [--display=DISPLAY] [--replace] [--sm-client-id=ID] [--sm-disable] [--sm-save-file=FILENAME] [--version] [--help]

DESCRIPTION
       This manual page documents briefly MUFFIN.

       MUFFIN  is a minimal X window manager aimed at nontechnical users and is designed to integrate well with the Cinnamon desktop.  MUFFIN lacks some features that may be expected by traditional UNIX
       or other technical users; these users may want to investigate other available window managers for use with Cinnamon or standalone.

              Connect to X display DISPLAY.

       --replace
              a window manager which is running is replaced by MUFFIN.  Users are encouraged to change the Cinnamon window manager by running the new WM with the --replace or -replace option, and subse‐
              quently saving the session.

       --sm-client-id=ID
              Specify a session management ID.
