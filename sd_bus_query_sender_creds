NAME
       sd_bus_query_sender_creds, sd_bus_query_sender_privilege - Query bus
       message sender credentials/privileges

SYNOPSIS
       #include <systemd/sd-bus.h>

       int sd_bus_query_sender_creds(sd_bus_message *m, uint64_t mask,
                                     sd_bus_creds **creds);

       sd_bus_error* sd_bus_query_sender_privilege(sd_bus_message *m,
                                                   int capability);

DESCRIPTION
       sd_bus_query_sender_creds() returns the credentials of the message m.
       The mask parameter is a combo of SD_BUS_CREDS_* flags that indicate
       which credential info the caller is interested in. See
       sd_bus_creds_new_from_pid(3) for a list of possible flags. First, this
       message checks if the requested credentials are attached to the message
       itself. If not, but the message contains the pid of the sender and the
       caller specified the SD_BUS_CREDS_AUGMENT flag, this function tries to
       figure out the missing credentials via other means (starting from the
       pid). If the pid isn't available but the message has a sender, this
       function calls sd_bus_get_name_creds(3) to get the requested
       credentials. If the message has no sender (when a direct connection is
       used), this function calls sd_bus_get_owner_creds(3) to get the
       requested credentials. On success, the requested credentials are stored
       in creds. Ownership of the credentials object in creds is transferred
       to the caller and should be freed by calling sd_bus_creds_unref(3).

       sd_bus_query_sender_privilege() checks if the message m has the
       requested privileges. If capability is a non-negative integer, this
       function checks if the message has the capability with the same value.
       See capabilities(7) for a list of capabilities. If capability is a
       negative integer, this function returns whether the sender of the
       message runs as the same user as the receiver of the message, or if the
       sender of the message runs as root and the receiver of the message does
       not run as root. On success and if the message has the requested
       privileges, this function returns a positive integer. If the message
       does not have the requested privileges, this function returns zero.

RETURN VALUE
       On success, these functions return a non-negative integer. On failure,
       they return a negative errno-style error code.

   Errors
       Returned errors may indicate the following problems:

       -EINVAL
           The message m or an output parameter is NULL.

       -ENOTCONN
           The bus of m is not connected.

       -ECHILD
           The bus of m was created in a different process.

       -EPERM
           The message m is not sealed.

NOTES
       These APIs are implemented as a shared library, which can be compiled
       and linked to with the libsystemd pkg-config(1) file.
