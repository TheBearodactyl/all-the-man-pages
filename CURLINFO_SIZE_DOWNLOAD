NAME
       CURLINFO_SIZE_DOWNLOAD - get the number of downloaded bytes

SYNOPSIS
       #include <curl/curl.h>

       CURLcode curl_easy_getinfo(CURL *handle, CURLINFO_SIZE_DOWNLOAD, double *dlp);

DESCRIPTION
       Pass a pointer to a double to receive the total amount of bytes that were downloaded.  The amount is only for the latest transfer and will be reset again for each new transfer. This counts actual
       payload data, what's also commonly called body. All meta and header data are excluded and will not be counted in this number.

       CURLINFO_SIZE_DOWNLOAD_T(3) is a newer replacement that returns a more sensible variable type.

PROTOCOLS
       All

EXAMPLE
       CURL *curl = curl_easy_init();
       if(curl) {
         curl_easy_setopt(curl, CURLOPT_URL, "https://example.com");

         /* Perform the request */
         res = curl_easy_perform(curl);

         if(!res) {
           /* check the size */
           double dl;
           res = curl_easy_getinfo(curl, CURLINFO_SIZE_DOWNLOAD, &dl);
           if(!res) {
             printf("Downloaded %.0f bytes\n", cl);
           }
         }
       }
