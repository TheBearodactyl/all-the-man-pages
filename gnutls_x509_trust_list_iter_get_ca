NAME
       gnutls_x509_trust_list_iter_get_ca - API function

SYNOPSIS
       #include <gnutls/x509.h>

       int gnutls_x509_trust_list_iter_get_ca(gnutls_x509_trust_list_t list, gnutls_x509_trust_list_iter_t * iter, gnutls_x509_crt_t * crt);

ARGUMENTS
       gnutls_x509_trust_list_t list
                   The list

       gnutls_x509_trust_list_iter_t * iter
                   A pointer to an iterator (initially the iterator should be NULL)

       gnutls_x509_crt_t * crt
                   where the certificate will be copied

DESCRIPTION
       This function obtains a certificate in the trust list and advances the iterator to the next certificate. The certificate returned in  crt must be deallocated with gnutls_x509_crt_deinit().

       When past the last element is accessed GNUTLS_E_REQUESTED_DATA_NOT_AVAILABLE is returned and the iterator is reset.

       The  iterator  is  deinitialized and reset to NULL automatically by this function after iterating through all elements until GNUTLS_E_REQUESTED_DATA_NOT_AVAILABLE is returned. If the iteration is
       aborted early, it must be manually deinitialized using gnutls_x509_trust_list_iter_deinit().

RETURNS
       On success, GNUTLS_E_SUCCESS (0) is returned, otherwise a negative error value.

SINCE
       3.4.0
