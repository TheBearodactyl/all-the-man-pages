SSL_CTX_SESSIONS(3ssl)              OpenSSL             SSL_CTX_SESSIONS(3ssl)

NAME
       SSL_CTX_sessions - access internal session cache

SYNOPSIS
        #include <openssl/ssl.h>

        LHASH_OF(SSL_SESSION) *SSL_CTX_sessions(SSL_CTX *ctx);

DESCRIPTION
       SSL_CTX_sessions() returns a pointer to the lhash databases containing
       the internal session cache for ctx.

NOTES
       The sessions in the internal session cache are kept in an LHASH(3) type
       database. It is possible to directly access this database e.g. for
       searching. In parallel, the sessions form a linked list which is
       maintained separately from the LHASH(3) operations, so that the
       database must not be modified directly but by using the
       SSL_CTX_add_session(3) family of functions.

RETURN VALUES
       SSL_CTX_sessions() returns a pointer to the lhash of SSL_SESSION.
