NAME
       XkbSetNames - Change the symbolic names in the server

SYNOPSIS
       Bool XkbSetNames (Display *dpy, unsigned int which, unsigned int first_type, unsigned int num_types, XkbDescPtr xkb);

ARGUMENTS
       dpy    connection to the X server

       which  mask of names or map components to be changed

       first_type
              first type whose name is to be changed

       num_types
              number of types for which names are to be changed

       xkb    keyboard description from which names are to be taken

DESCRIPTION
       To  change  the  symbolic names in the server, first modify a local copy of the keyboard description and then use either XkbSetNames, or, to save network traffic, use a XkbNameChangesRecstructure
       and call XkbChangeNames to download the changes to the server.  XkbSetNames and XkbChangeNames can generate BadAlloc, BadAtom, BadLength, BadMatch, and BadImplementation errors.

       Use XkbSetNames to change many names at the same time. For each bit set in which, XkbSetNames takes the corresponding value (or values in the case of arrays) from the keyboard description xkb and
       sends it to the server.

       The  first_type  and  num_types arguments are used only if XkbKeyTypeNamesMask or XkbKTLevelNamesMask is set in which and specify a subset of the types for which the corresponding names are to be
       changed. If either or both of these mask bits are set but the specified types are illegal, XkbSetNames returns False and does not update any of the names specified in which.  The specified  types
       are illegal if xkb does not include a map component or if first_type and num_types specify types that are not defined in the keyboard description.

STRUCTURES
       The XkbNameChangesRec allows applications to identify small modifications to the symbolic names and effectively reduces the amount of traffic sent to the server:

           typedef struct _XkbNameChanges {
               unsigned int   changed;          /* name components that have changed */
               unsigned char  first_type;       /* first key type with a new name */
               unsigned char  num_types;        /* number of types with new names */
               unsigned char  first_lvl;        /* first key type with new level names */
               unsigned char  num_lvls;         /* number of key types with new level names */
               unsigned char  num_aliases;      /* if key aliases changed, total number of key aliases */
               unsigned char  num_rg;           /* if radio groups changed, total number of radio groups */
               unsigned char  first_key;        /* first key with a new name */
               unsigned char  num_keys;         /* number of keys with new names */
               unsigned short changed_vmods;    /* mask of virtual modifiers for which names have changed */
               unsigned long  changed_indicators; /* mask of indicators for which names were changed */
               unsigned char  changed_groups;     /* mask of groups for which names were changed */
           } XkbNameChangesRec, *XkbNameChangesPtr

       The  changed field specifies the name components that have changed and is the bitwise inclusive OR of the valid names mask bits defined in Table 1. The rest of the fields in the structure specify
       the ranges that have changed for the various kinds of symbolic names, as shown in Table 2.

       Xkb provides several functions that work with symbolic names. Each of these functions uses a mask to specify individual fields of the structures described above. These masks and  their  relation‐
       ships to the fields in a keyboard description are shown in Table 1.
