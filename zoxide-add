NAME
       zoxide-add - add a new directory or increment its rank

SYNOPSIS
       zoxide add [PATHS]

DESCRIPTION
       If the directory is not already in the database, this command creates a new entry for it with a default score of 1, otherwise, it increments the existing score by 1. It then sets the last updated
       field of the entry to the current time. After this, it runs the AGING algorithm on the database. See zoxide(1) for more about the algorithm.

       If you'd like to prevent a directory from being added to the database, see the _ZO_EXCLUDE_DIRS environment variable in zoxide(1).

OPTIONS
       -h, --help
              Print help information.
