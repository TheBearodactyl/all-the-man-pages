NAME
       gnutls_x509_name_constraints_add_excluded - API function

SYNOPSIS
       #include <gnutls/x509.h>

       int gnutls_x509_name_constraints_add_excluded(gnutls_x509_name_constraints_t nc, gnutls_x509_subject_alt_name_t            type, const gnutls_datum_t * name);

ARGUMENTS
       gnutls_x509_name_constraints_t nc
                   The nameconstraints

       gnutls_x509_subject_alt_name_t            type
                   The type of the constraints

       const gnutls_datum_t * name
                   The data of the constraints

DESCRIPTION
       This  function  will  add a name constraint to the list of excluded constraints. The constraints  type can be any of the following types: GNUTLS_SAN_DNSNAME, GNUTLS_SAN_RFC822NAME, GNUTLS_SAN_DN,
       GNUTLS_SAN_URI, GNUTLS_SAN_IPADDRESS. For the latter, an IP address in network byte order is expected, followed by its network mask (which is 4 bytes in IPv4 or 16-bytes in IPv6).

RETURNS
       On success, GNUTLS_E_SUCCESS (0) is returned, otherwise a negative error value.

SINCE
       3.3.0
