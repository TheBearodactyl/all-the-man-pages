NAME
       gnutls_x509_crt_get_extension_oid - API function

SYNOPSIS
       #include <gnutls/x509.h>

       int gnutls_x509_crt_get_extension_oid(gnutls_x509_crt_t cert, unsigned indx, void * oid, size_t * oid_size);

ARGUMENTS
       gnutls_x509_crt_t cert
                   should contain a gnutls_x509_crt_t type

       unsigned indx
                   Specifies which extension OID to send. Use (0) to get the first one.

       void * oid  a pointer to a structure to hold the OID (may be null)

       size_t * oid_size
                   initially holds the size of  oid

DESCRIPTION
       This function will return the requested extension OID in the certificate.  The extension OID will be stored as a string in the provided buffer.

       The  oid returned will be null terminated, although  oid_size will not account for the trailing null.

RETURNS
       On  success,  GNUTLS_E_SUCCESS  (0)  is  returned, otherwise a negative error code is returned.  If you have reached the last extension available GNUTLS_E_REQUESTED_DATA_NOT_AVAILABLE will be re‐
       turned.
