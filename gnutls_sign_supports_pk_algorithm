NAME
       gnutls_sign_supports_pk_algorithm - API function

SYNOPSIS
       #include <gnutls/gnutls.h>

       unsigned gnutls_sign_supports_pk_algorithm(gnutls_sign_algorithm_t sign, gnutls_pk_algorithm_t pk);

ARGUMENTS
       gnutls_sign_algorithm_t sign
                   is a signature algorithm

       gnutls_pk_algorithm_t pk
                   is a public key algorithm

DESCRIPTION
       This function returns non-zero if the public key algorithm corresponds to the given signature algorithm. That is, if that signature can be generated from the given private key algorithm.

SINCE
       3.6.0

RETURNS
       return non-zero when the provided algorithms are compatible.
