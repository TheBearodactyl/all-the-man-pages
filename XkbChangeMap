NAME
       XkbChangeMap - Update only partial components of a keyboard description, modify the appropriate fields in the server and map components of a local copy of the keyboard description

SYNOPSIS
       Bool XkbChangeMap (Display *dpy, XkbDescPtr xkb, XkbMapChangesPtr changes);

ARGUMENTS
       dpy    connection to X server

       xkb    description from which new values are taken

       changes
              identifies component parts to update

DESCRIPTION
       To  update  only  partial  components of a keyboard description, modify the appropriate fields in the server and map components of a local copy of the keyboard description, then call XkbChangeMap
       with an XkbMapChangesRec structure indicating which components have changed.

       XkbChangeMap copies any components specified by the changes structure from the keyboard description, xkb, to the X server specified by dpy.

       If any components specified by changes are not present in the xkb parameter, XkbChangeMap returns False. Otherwise, it sends a request to the server and returns True.

       XkbChangeMap can generate BadAlloc, BadLength, and BadValue protocol errors.

RETURN VALUES
       True           The XkbChangeMap function returns True if the components specified by changes are present in the xkb parameter.

       False          The XkbChangeMap function returns False if the components specified by changes are not present in the xkb parameter.

STRUCTURES
       Use the XkbMapChangesRec structure to identify and track partial modifications to the mapping components and to reduce the amount of traffic between the server and clients.

           KeyCode          first_key_explicit; /* first key whose explicit entry changed */
           unsigned char    num_key_explicit;   /* # explicit entries changed */
           KeyCode          first_modmap_key;   /* first key whose modmap entry changed */
           unsigned char    num_modmap_keys;    /* # modmap entries changed */
           KeyCode          first_vmodmap_key;  /* first key whose vmodmap changed */
           unsigned char    num_vmodmap_keys;   /* # vmodmap entries changed */
           unsigned char    pad1;               /* reserved */
           unsigned short   vmods;              /* mask indicating which vmods changed */
       } XkbMapChangesRec,*XkbMapChangesPtr;

DIAGNOSTICS
       BadAlloc       Unable to allocate storage

       BadLength      The length of a request is shorter or longer than that required to minimally contain the arguments

       BadValue       An argument is out of range
