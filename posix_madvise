NAME
       posix_madvise - give advice about patterns of memory usage

LIBRARY
       Standard C library (libc, -lc)

SYNOPSIS
       #include <sys/mman.h>

       int posix_madvise(void addr[.len], size_t len, int advice);

   Feature Test Macro Requirements for glibc (see feature_test_macros(7)):

       posix_madvise():
           _POSIX_C_SOURCE >= 200112L

DESCRIPTION
       The posix_madvise() function allows an application to advise the system
       about its expected patterns of usage of memory  in  the  address  range
       starting  at  addr and continuing for len bytes.  The system is free to
       use this advice in order to improve the performance of memory  accesses
       (or to ignore the advice altogether), but calling posix_madvise() shall
       not affect the semantics of access to memory in the specified range.

       The advice argument is one of the following:

       POSIX_MADV_NORMAL
              The application has no special advice regarding its memory usage
              patterns  for  the specified address range.  This is the default
              behavior.

       POSIX_MADV_SEQUENTIAL
              The application expects to access the  specified  address  range
              sequentially,  running from lower addresses to higher addresses.
              Hence, pages in this region can be aggressively read ahead,  and
              may be freed soon after they are accessed.

       POSIX_MADV_RANDOM
              The  application  expects  to access the specified address range
              randomly.  Thus, read ahead may be less useful than normally.

       POSIX_MADV_WILLNEED
              The application expects to access the specified address range in
              the near future.  Thus, read ahead may be beneficial.

       POSIX_MADV_DONTNEED
              The  application  expects  that it will not access the specified
              address range in the near future.

RETURN VALUE
       On success, posix_madvise() returns 0.  On failure, it returns a  posi‐
       tive error number.

ERRORS
       EINVAL addr  is  not a multiple of the system page size or len is nega‐
              tive.

       EINVAL advice is invalid.

       ENOMEM Addresses in the specified range  are  partially  or  completely
              outside the caller's address space.

VERSIONS
       POSIX.1 permits an implementation to generate an error if len is 0.  On
       Linux, specifying len as 0 is permitted (as a successful no-op).

       In glibc, this function  is  implemented  using  madvise(2).   However,
       since glibc 2.6, POSIX_MADV_DONTNEED is treated as a no-op, because the
       corresponding madvise(2) value, MADV_DONTNEED, has  destructive  seman‐
       tics.

STANDARDS
       POSIX.1-2008.

PROLOG
       This  manual  page is part of the POSIX Programmer's Manual.  The Linux
       implementation of this interface may differ (consult the  corresponding

       not be implemented on Linux.

NAME
       posix_madvise — memory advisory information and alignment control  (AD‐
       VANCED REALTIME)

SYNOPSIS
       #include <sys/mman.h>

       int posix_madvise(void *addr, size_t len, int advice);

DESCRIPTION
       The posix_madvise() function shall advise the implementation on the ex‐
       pected behavior of the application with respect to the data in the mem‐
       ory  starting at address addr, and continuing for len bytes. The imple‐
       mentation may use this information to optimize handling of  the  speci‐
       fied data. The posix_madvise() function shall have no effect on the se‐
       mantics of access to memory in the specified range, although it may af‐
       fect the performance of access.

       The  implementation  may  require  that  addr be a multiple of the page
       size, which is the value returned by  sysconf()  when  the  name  value
       _SC_PAGESIZE is used.

       The advice to be applied to the memory range is specified by the advice
       parameter and may be one of the following values:

       POSIX_MADV_NORMAL
             Specifies that the application has no advice to give on  its  be‐
             havior  with  respect  to  the specified range. It is the default
             characteristic if no advice is given for a range of memory.

       POSIX_MADV_SEQUENTIAL
             Specifies that the application expects to  access  the  specified
             range sequentially from lower addresses to higher addresses.

       POSIX_MADV_RANDOM
             Specifies  that  the  application expects to access the specified
             range in a random order.

       POSIX_MADV_WILLNEED
             Specifies that the application expects to  access  the  specified
             range in the near future.

       POSIX_MADV_DONTNEED
             Specifies  that  the  application expects that it will not access
             the specified range in the near future.

       These values are defined in the <sys/mman.h> header.

RETURN VALUE
       Upon successful completion, posix_madvise() shall return  zero;  other‐
       wise, an error number shall be returned to indicate the error.

ERRORS
       The posix_madvise() function shall fail if:

       EINVAL The value of advice is invalid.

       ENOMEM Addresses  in  the range starting at addr and continuing for len
              bytes are partly or completely outside the range allowed for the
              address space of the calling process.

       The posix_madvise() function may fail if:

       EINVAL The  value  of  addr  is not a multiple of the value returned by
              sysconf() when the name value _SC_PAGESIZE is used.

       EINVAL The value of len is zero.

EXAMPLES
       None.

APPLICATION USAGE
       The posix_madvise() function is part of the Advisory Information option
       and need not be provided on all implementations.

RATIONALE
       None.

FUTURE DIRECTIONS
       None.
