NAME
       BN_mod_mul_reciprocal, BN_div_recp, BN_RECP_CTX_new, BN_RECP_CTX_free,
       BN_RECP_CTX_set - modular multiplication using reciprocal

SYNOPSIS
        #include <openssl/bn.h>

        BN_RECP_CTX *BN_RECP_CTX_new(void);
        void BN_RECP_CTX_free(BN_RECP_CTX *recp);

        int BN_RECP_CTX_set(BN_RECP_CTX *recp, const BIGNUM *m, BN_CTX *ctx);

        int BN_div_recp(BIGNUM *dv, BIGNUM *rem, const BIGNUM *a, BN_RECP_CTX *recp,
                        BN_CTX *ctx);

        int BN_mod_mul_reciprocal(BIGNUM *r, const BIGNUM *a, const BIGNUM *b,
                                  BN_RECP_CTX *recp, BN_CTX *ctx);

DESCRIPTION
       BN_mod_mul_reciprocal() can be used to perform an efficient
       BN_mod_mul(3) operation when the operation will be performed repeatedly
       with the same modulus. It computes r=(a*b)%m using recp=1/m, which is
       set as described below.  ctx is a previously allocated BN_CTX used for
       temporary variables.

       BN_RECP_CTX_new() allocates and initializes a BN_RECP structure.

       BN_RECP_CTX_free() frees the components of the BN_RECP, and, if it was
       created by BN_RECP_CTX_new(), also the structure itself.  If recp is
       NULL, nothing is done.

       BN_RECP_CTX_set() stores m in recp and sets it up for computing 1/m and
       shifting it left by BN_num_bits(m)+1 to make it an integer. The result
       and the number of bits it was shifted left will later be stored in
       recp.

       BN_div_recp() divides a by m using recp. It places the quotient in dv
       and the remainder in rem.

       The BN_RECP_CTX structure cannot be shared between threads.

RETURN VALUES
       BN_RECP_CTX_new() returns the newly allocated BN_RECP_CTX, and NULL on
       error.

       BN_RECP_CTX_free() has no return value.

       For the other functions, 1 is returned for success, 0 on error.  The
       error codes can be obtained by ERR_get_error(3).
