SSL_LIBRARY_INIT(3ssl)              OpenSSL             SSL_LIBRARY_INIT(3ssl)

NAME
       SSL_library_init, OpenSSL_add_ssl_algorithms - initialize SSL library
       by registering algorithms

SYNOPSIS
        #include <openssl/ssl.h>

        int SSL_library_init(void);

        int OpenSSL_add_ssl_algorithms(void);

DESCRIPTION
       SSL_library_init() registers the available SSL/TLS ciphers and digests.

       OpenSSL_add_ssl_algorithms() is a synonym for SSL_library_init() and is
       implemented as a macro.

NOTES
       SSL_library_init() must be called before any other action takes place.
       SSL_library_init() is not reentrant.

WARNINGS
       SSL_library_init() adds ciphers and digests used directly and
       indirectly by SSL/TLS.

RETURN VALUES
       SSL_library_init() always returns "1", so it is safe to discard the
       return value.

SEE ALSO
       ssl(7), RAND_add(3)

HISTORY
       The SSL_library_init() and OpenSSL_add_ssl_algorithms() functions were
       deprecated in OpenSSL 1.1.0 by OPENSSL_init_ssl().
