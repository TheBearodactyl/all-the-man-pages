NAME
       gnutls_prf_hash_get - API function

SYNOPSIS
       #include <gnutls/gnutls.h>

       gnutls_digest_algorithm_t gnutls_prf_hash_get(const gnutls_session_t session);

ARGUMENTS
       const gnutls_session_t session
                   is a gnutls_session_t type.

DESCRIPTION
       Get the currently used hash algorithm. In TLS 1.3, the hash algorithm is used for both the key derivation function and handshake message authentication code. In TLS 1.2, it matches the hash algo‐
       rithm used for PRF.

RETURNS
       the currently used hash algorithm, a gnutls_digest_algorithm_t value.

SINCE
