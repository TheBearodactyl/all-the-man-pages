NAME
       TIFFStrileQuery - get strile byte count and offset

SYNOPSIS
          #include <tiffio.h>

       uint64_t TIFFGetStrileByteCount(TIFF *tif, uint32_t strile);

       uint64_t TIFFGetStrileOffset(TIFF *tif, uint32_t strile);

       uint64_t TIFFGetStrileByteCountWithErr(TIFF *tif, uint32_t strile, int *pbErr);

       uint64_t TIFFGetStrileOffsetWithErr(TIFF *tif, uint32_t strile, int *pbErr);

DESCRIPTION
       Make  defer  strile  offset/bytecount  loading  available at runtime and add per-strile offset/bytecount loading capabilities. Part of this commit makes the behaviour that was previously met when
       libtiff was compiled with -DDEFER_STRILE_LOAD available for default builds.

       When specifying the new D (Deferred) TIFFOpen() flag, the loading of strile offset/bytecount is defered.  In that mode, the StripOffsets / StripByteCounts or TileOffsets /  TileByteCounts  arrays
       are only loaded when first accessed. This can speed-up the opening of files stored on the network when just metadata retrieval is needed.

       Another  addition  is  the  capability  of  loading only the values of the offset/bytecount of the strile of interest instead of the whole array. This is enabled with the new O (Ondemand) flag of
       TIFFOpen() (which implies D).

       The public TIFFGetStrileOffset(), TIFFGetStrileOffsetWithErr(), TIFFGetStrileByteCount() and TIFFGetStrileByteCountWithErr() functions have been added to API.  They  are  of  particular  interest
       when using sparse files (with offset == bytecount == 0) and you want to detect if a strile is present or not without decompressing the data, or updating an existing sparse file.

       TIFFGetStrileByteCount() returns the value of the TileByteCounts / StripByteCounts array for the specified tile/strile.

       TIFFGetStrileByteCountWithErr() additionally provides pbErr as an int pointer to an error return variable, which is set to “0” for successful return or to “1” for an error return.

DIAGNOSTICS
       All error messages are directed to the TIFFErrorExtR() routine.  Likewise, warning messages are directed to the TIFFWarningExtR() routine.
