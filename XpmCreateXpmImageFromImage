NAME
       XpmCreateXpmImage - create an Xpm image

SYNOPSIS
       int XpmCreateXpmImageFromData(char **data, XpmImage *image,
              XpmInfo *info);

       int XpmCreateXpmImageFromBuffer(char *buffer, XpmImage *image,
              XpmInfo *info);

       int XpmCreateXpmImageFromImage(Display *display,
              XImage *image, XImage *shapeimage,
              XpmImage *xpmimage, XpmAttributes *attributes);

       int XpmCreateXpmImageFromPixmap(Display *display,
              Pixmap *pixmap, Pixmap *shapemask,
              XpmImage *xpmimage, XpmAttributes *attributes);

ARGUMENTS
       data   Specifies the location of the data.

       image  Specifies the image structure location.

       info   Specifies the location of an XpmInfo structure to get and store information (or NULL).

       display
              Specifies the connection to the X server.

       image  Specifies the X image used as the source.

       shapeimage
              Specifies the shape mask image, if any.

       xpmimage
              Specifies the XPM image which is created.

       attributes
              Specifies the location of a structure containing information (or NULL).

DESCRIPTION
   XpmCreateXpmImageFromBuffer
       To  create  an  XpmImage from an XPM buffer, use XpmCreateXpmImageFromBuffer().  The XpmCreateXpmImageFromBuffer() function reads the given buffer to fill in the given XpmImage structure.  If the
       buffer does not contain valid XPM data, it returns XpmFileInvalid.  If insufficient working storage is allocated, it returns XpmNoMemory.  On success it returns XpmSuccess.  If the passed XpmInfo
       structure pointer is not NULL, XpmCreateXpmImageFromBuffer() looks for the following attributes: XpmReturnComments and XpmReturnExtensions, and sets possibly the XpmHotspot attribute when return‚Äê
       ing.  As specified in the table (page 28), if the data related to the attributes XpmReturnComments and XpmReturnExtensions cannot be returned as requested because of insufficient memory  storage,
       XpmCreateXpmImageFromBuffer() will change the valuemask to mention this and will try to continue.  So the caller should check on this before accessing requested data.

       Note: The valuemask of the passed XpmInfo structure must be set to some valid value, at least zero, otherwise unpredictable errors can occur.

   XpmCreateXpmImageFromData
       To create an XpmImage from an XPM data, use XpmCreateXpmImageFromData().  XpmCreateXpmImageFromData() fills in the given XpmImage structure from the given data. If the data does not contain valid
       XPM data, it returns XpmFileInvalid.  If insufficient working storage is allocated, it returns XpmNoMemory.  On success it returns XpmSuccess.  If the passed  XpmInfo  structure  pointer  is  not
       NULL,  XpmCreateXpmImageFromData() looks for the following attributes: XpmReturnExtensions, and sets possibly the XpmHotspot attribute when returning.  As specified in the table (page 28), if the
       data related to the attribute XpmReturnExtensions cannot be returned as requested because of insufficient memory storage, XpmCreateXpmImageFromData() will change the valuemask to mention this and
       will try to continue.  So the caller should check on this before accessing requested data.

       Note: The valuemask of the passed XpmInfo structure must be set to some valid value, at least zero, otherwise unpredictable errors can occur.

   XpmCreateXpmImageFromImage
       To create an XpmImage from an XImage, use XpmCreateXpmImageFromImage().  From the given X images and XpmAttributes if not NULL, XpmCreateXpmImageFromImage() creates an XpmImage following the same
       mechanism as XpmWriteFileFromImage(3).

   XpmCreateXpmImageFromPixmap
       To create an XpmImage from a Pixmap, use XpmCreateXpmImageFromPixmap().  From the given pixmaps and XpmAttributes if not NULL, XpmCreateXpmImageFromPixmap() gets the related  XImages  by  calling
       XGetImage, then it gives them to XpmCreateXpmImageFromImage() to create an XpmImage which is returned to xpmimage.  Finally it destroys the created X images using XDestroyImage(3).
