psignal(3)                 Library Functions Manual                 psignal(3)

NAME
       psignal, psiginfo - print signal description

LIBRARY
       Standard C library (libc, -lc)

SYNOPSIS
       #include <signal.h>

       void psignal(int sig, const char *s);
       void psiginfo(const siginfo_t *pinfo, const char *s);

   Feature Test Macro Requirements for glibc (see feature_test_macros(7)):

       psignal():
           Since glibc 2.19:
                   _DEFAULT_SOURCE
           glibc 2.19 and earlier:
               _BSD_SOURCE || _SVID_SOURCE

       psiginfo():
           _POSIX_C_SOURCE >= 200809L

DESCRIPTION
       The  psignal()  function displays a message on stderr consisting of the
       string s, a colon, a space, a string describing the signal number  sig,
       and  a  trailing  newline.  If the string s is NULL or empty, the colon
       and space are omitted.  If sig is invalid, the message  displayed  will
       indicate an unknown signal.

       The  psiginfo() function is like psignal(), except that it displays in‐
       formation about the signal described by pinfo, which should point to  a
       valid  siginfo_t  structure.   As well as the signal description, psig‐
       info() displays information about the origin of the signal,  and  other
       information  relevant  to the signal (e.g., the relevant memory address
       for hardware-generated signals, the child process ID for  SIGCHLD,  and
       the user ID and process ID of the sender, for signals set using kill(2)
       or sigqueue(3)).

RETURN VALUE
       The psignal() and psiginfo() functions return no value.

STANDARDS
       POSIX.1-2008.

HISTORY
       glibc 2.10.  POSIX.1-2008, 4.3BSD.

BUGS
       Up to glibc 2.12, psiginfo() had the following bugs:

       •  In some circumstances, a trailing newline is not printed.

       •  Additional details are not displayed for real-time signals.

PROLOG
       This  manual  page is part of the POSIX Programmer's Manual.  The Linux
       implementation of this interface may differ (consult the  corresponding
       Linux  manual page for details of Linux behavior), or the interface may
       not be implemented on Linux.

NAME
       psiginfo, psignal — write signal information to standard error

SYNOPSIS
       #include <signal.h>

       void psiginfo(const siginfo_t *pinfo, const char *message);
       void psignal(int signum, const char *message);

DESCRIPTION
       The psiginfo() and psignal() functions shall write a language-dependent
       message associated with a signal number to the standard error stream as
       follows:

        *  First, if message is not a  null  pointer  and  is  not  the  empty
           string,  the  string  pointed  to  by the message argument shall be
           written, followed by a <colon> and a <space>.

        *  Then the signal description string associated with signum  or  with
           the signal indicated by pinfo shall be written, followed by a <new‐
           line>.

       For psiginfo(), the application shall ensure that  the  argument  pinfo
       references a valid siginfo_t structure. For psignal(), if signum is not
       a valid signal number, the behavior is implementation-defined.

       The psiginfo() and psignal() functions shall not change the orientation
       of the standard error stream.

       The  psiginfo()  and psignal() functions shall mark for update the last
       data modification and last file status change timestamps  of  the  file
       associated  with  the  standard error stream at some time between their
       successful  completion  and  exit(),  abort(),  or  the  completion  of
       fflush() or fclose() on stderr.

       The  psiginfo() and psignal() functions shall not change the setting of
       errno if successful.

       On error, the psiginfo() and psignal() functions shall  set  the  error
       indicator for the stream to which stderr points, and shall set errno to
       indicate the error.

       Since no value is returned, an application wishing to check  for  error
       situations  should  set  errno to 0, then call psiginfo() or psignal(),
       then check errno.

RETURN VALUE
       These functions shall not return a value.

ERRORS
       Refer to fputc().

       The following sections are informative.

EXAMPLES
       None.

APPLICATION USAGE
       As an alternative to setting errno to zero before the call and checking
       if  it  is non-zero afterwards, applications can use ferror() to detect
       whether psiginfo() or psignal() encountered an error.

       An application wishing to use this method to check for error situations
       should  call  clearerr(stderr)  before calling psiginfo() or psignal(),
       then if ferror(stderr) returns non-zero, the value of  errno  indicates
       which error occurred.

RATIONALE
       System  V  historically  has  psignal()  and psiginfo() in <siginfo.h>.
       However, the <siginfo.h> header is not specified in  the  Base  Defini‐
       tions  volume  of  POSIX.1‐2017,  and  the type siginfo_t is defined in
       <signal.h>.

FUTURE DIRECTIONS
       None.
