PCRE2_SUBSTRING_NAMETABLE_SLibrary Functions PCRE2_SUBSTRING_NAMETABLE_SCAN(3)

NAME
       PCRE2 - Perl-compatible regular expressions (revised API)

SYNOPSIS

       #include <pcre2.h>

       int pcre2_substring_nametable_scan(const pcre2_code *code,
         PCRE2_SPTR name, PCRE2_SPTR *first, PCRE2_SPTR *last);

DESCRIPTION

       This  convenience function finds, for a compiled pattern, the first and
       last entries for a given name in  the  table  that  translates  capture
       group names into numbers.

         code    Compiled regular expression
         name    Name whose entries required
         first   Where to return a pointer to the first entry
         last    Where to return a pointer to the last entry

       When the name is found in the table, if first is NULL, the function re‚Äê
       turns a group number, but if there is more than one matching entry,  it
       is  not defined which one. Otherwise, when both pointers have been set,
       the yield of the function is the length of each entry in code units. If
       the name is not found, PCRE2_ERROR_NOSUBSTRING is returned.

       There  is a complete description of the PCRE2 native API, including the
       format of the table entries, in the pcre2api page, and a description of
       the POSIX API in the pcre2posix page.
