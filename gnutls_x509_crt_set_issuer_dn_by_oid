NAME
       gnutls_x509_crt_set_issuer_dn_by_oid - API function

SYNOPSIS
       #include <gnutls/x509.h>

       int gnutls_x509_crt_set_issuer_dn_by_oid(gnutls_x509_crt_t crt, const char * oid, unsigned int raw_flag, const void * name, unsigned int sizeof_name);

ARGUMENTS
       gnutls_x509_crt_t crt
                   a certificate of type gnutls_x509_crt_t

       const char * oid
                   holds an Object Identifier in a null terminated string

       unsigned int raw_flag
                   must be 0, or 1 if the data are DER encoded

       const void * name
                   a pointer to the name

       unsigned int sizeof_name
                   holds the size of  name

DESCRIPTION
       This function will set the part of the name of the Certificate issuer, specified by the given OID.  The input string should be ASCII or UTF-8 encoded.

       Some  helper macros with popular OIDs can be found in gnutls/x509.h With this function you can only set the known OIDs. You can test for known OIDs using gnutls_x509_dn_oid_known(). For OIDs that
       are not known (by gnutls) you should properly DER encode your data, and call this function with  raw_flag set.

       Normally you do not need to call this function, since the signing operation will copy the signer's name as the issuer of the certificate.

RETURNS
       On success, GNUTLS_E_SUCCESS (0) is returned, otherwise a negative error value.
