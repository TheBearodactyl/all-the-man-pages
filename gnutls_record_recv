NAME
       gnutls_record_recv - API function

SYNOPSIS
       #include <gnutls/gnutls.h>

       ssize_t gnutls_record_recv(gnutls_session_t session, void * data, size_t data_size);

ARGUMENTS
       gnutls_session_t session
                   is a gnutls_session_t type.

       void * data the buffer that the data will be read into

       size_t data_size
                   the number of requested bytes

DESCRIPTION
       This  function has the similar semantics with recv().  The only difference is that it accepts a GnuTLS session, and uses different error codes.  In the special case that the peer requests a rene‐
       gotiation, the caller will receive an error code of GNUTLS_E_REHANDSHAKE.  In case of a client, this message may be simply ignored, replied with an  alert  GNUTLS_A_NO_RENEGOTIATION,  or  replied
       with a new handshake, depending on the client's will. A server receiving this error code can only initiate a new handshake or terminate the session.

       If  EINTR  is returned by the internal pull function (the default is recv()) then GNUTLS_E_INTERRUPTED will be returned.  If GNUTLS_E_INTERRUPTED or GNUTLS_E_AGAIN is returned, you must call this
       function again to get the data.  See also gnutls_record_get_direction().

RETURNS
       The number of bytes received and zero on EOF (for stream connections).  A negative error code is returned in case of an error.  The number of bytes received  might  be  less  than  the  requested
       data_size .
