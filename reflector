NAME
       reflector - retrieve and filter the latest Pacman mirrorlist

SYNOPSIS
       reflector [arguments]

DESCRIPTION
       reflector  is a Python script and associated Python module that can re‐
       trieve up-to-date  Arch  Linux  mirror  data  from  the  Mirror  Status
       (https://www.archlinux.org/mirrors/status/) web interface.

ARGUMENTS
       See reflector --help.

EXAMPLES
       Print the latest mirrorlist to STDOUT:

              reflector

       Sort  the five most recently synchronized mirrors by download speed and
       overwrite the local mirrorlist:

              reflector --latest 5 --sort rate --save /etc/pacman.d/mirrorlist

       Select the 200 most recently synchronized HTTP or HTTPS  mirrors,  sort
       them  by  download  speed,  and  overwrite  the file /etc/pacman.d/mir‐
       rorlist:

              reflector --latest 200 --protocol http,https --sort rate --save /etc/pacman.d/mirrorlist

       Select the HTTPS mirrors synchronized within the last 12 hours and  lo‐
       cated  in  either  France  or Germany, sort them by download speed, and
       overwrite the file /etc/pacman.d/mirrorlist with the results:

              reflector --country France,Germany --age 12 --protocol https --sort rate --save /etc/pacman.d/mirrorlist

SYSTEMD INTEGRATION
       Reflector includes systemd service and timer units that can be used  to
       automatically  update  Pacman’s mirrorlist.  To use the timer, edit the
       configuration file at /etc/xdg/reflector/reflector.conf and then enable
       the timer with

              systemctl enable reflector.timer
              systemctl start reflector.timer

       Check that status with systemctl list-timers.  To update the mirrorlist
       immediately instead of waiting for the scheduled operation, run system‐
       ctl start reflector.service.
