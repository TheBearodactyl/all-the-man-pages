NAME
       tep_print_event - Writes event information into a trace sequence.

SYNOPSIS
       #include <event-parse.h>
       #include <trace-seq.h>

       void tep_print_event(struct tep_handle *tep, struct trace_seq*s, struct tep_record *record, const char *fmt, ...)

DESCRIPTION
       The tep_print_event() function parses the event information of the given record and writes it into the trace sequence s, according to the format string fmt. The desired information is specified
       after the format string. The fmt is printf-like format string, following arguments are supported:

                   TEP_PRINT_PID, "%d"  - PID of the event.
                   TEP_PRINT_CPU, "%d"  - Event CPU.
                   TEP_PRINT_COMM, "%s" - Event command string.
                   TEP_PRINT_NAME, "%s" - Event name.
                   TEP_PRINT_LATENCY, "%s" - Latency of the event. It prints 4 or more
                                   fields - interrupt state, scheduling state,
                                   current context, and preemption count.
                                   Field 1 is the interrupt enabled state:
                                           d : Interrupts are disabled
                                           . : Interrupts are enabled
                                           X : The architecture does not support this
                                               information
                                   Field 2 is the "need resched" state.
                                           N : The task is set to call the scheduler when
                                               possible, as another higher priority task
                                               may need to be scheduled in.
                                           . : The task is not set to call the scheduler.
                                   Field 3 is the context state.
                                           . : Normal context
                                           s : Soft interrupt context
                                           h : Hard interrupt context
                                           H : Hard interrupt context which triggered
                                               during soft interrupt context.
                                           z : NMI context
                                           Z : NMI context which triggered during hard
                                               interrupt context
                                   Field 4 is the preemption count.
                                           . : The preempt count is zero.
                                   On preemptible kernels (where the task can be scheduled
                                   out in arbitrary locations while in kernel context), the
                                   preempt count, when non zero, will prevent the kernel
                                   from scheduling out the current task. The preempt count
                                   number is displayed when it is not zero.
                                   Depending on the kernel, it may show other fields
                                   (lock depth, or migration disabled, which are unique to
                                   specialized kernels).
                   TEP_PRINT_TIME, %d - event time stamp. A divisor and precision can be
                                   specified as part of this format string:
                                   "%precision.divisord". Example:
                                   "%3.1000d" - divide the time by 1000 and print the first
                                   3 digits before the dot. Thus, the time stamp
                                   "123456000" will be printed as "123.456"
                   TEP_PRINT_INFO, "%s" - event information.
                   TEP_PRINT_INFO_RAW, "%s" - event information, in raw format.

                   Trace sequences are used to allow a function to call several other functions
                   to create a string of data to use.
