NAME
       Test2::EventFacet::Error - Facet for errors that need to be shown.

DESCRIPTION
       This facet is used when an event needs to convey errors.

NOTES
       This facet has the hash key 'errors', and is a list of facets instead of a single item.

FIELDS
       $string = $error->{details}
       $string = $error->details()
           Explanation of the error, or the error itself (such as an exception). In perl exceptions may be blessed objects, so this field may contain a blessed object.

       $short_string = $error->{tag}
       $short_string = $error->tag()
           Short tag to categorize the error. This is usually 10 characters or less, formatters may truncate longer tags.

       $bool = $error->{fail}
       $bool = $error->fail()
           Not all errors are fatal, some are displayed having already been handled. Set this to true if you want the error to cause the test to fail. Without this the error is simply a diagnostics
           message that has no effect on the overall pass/fail result.
