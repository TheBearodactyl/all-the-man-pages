NAME
       XkbAddGeomSection - Add one section to an existing keyboard geometry

SYNOPSIS
       XkbSectionPtr XkbAddGeomSection (XkbGeometryPtr geom, Atom name, int sz_rows, int sz_doodads, int sz_overlays);

ARGUMENTS
       geom   geometry to be updated

       name   name of the new section

       sz_rows
              number of rows to reserve in the section

       sz_doodads
              number of doodads to reserve in the section

       sz_overlays
              number of overlays to reserve in the section

DESCRIPTION
       Xkb  provides  functions  to add a single new element to the top-level keyboard geometry. In each case the num_ * fields of the corresponding structure is incremented by 1. These functions do not
       change sz_* unless there is no more room in the array. Some of these functions fill in the values of the element's structure from the arguments. For other functions,  you  must  explicitly  write
       code to fill the structure's elements.

       The top-level geometry description includes a list of geometry properties.  A geometry property associates an arbitrary string with an equally arbitrary name. Programs that display images of key‐
       boards can use geometry properties as hints, but they are not interpreted by Xkb. No other geometry structures refer to geometry properties.

       A keyboard geometry contains an arbitrary number of sections.  XkbAddGeomSection adds one section to an existing keyboard geometry geom.  The new section contains space for the  number  of  rows,
       doodads, and overlays specified by sz_rows, sz_doodads, and sz_overlays.  The new section is allocated and zeroed and given the name specified by name.  If a section with name name already exists
       in the geometry, a pointer to the existing section is returned.  XkbAddGeomSection returns NULL if any of the parameters is empty or if it was not able to allocate space for the section. To allo‐
       cate space for an arbitrary number of sections to a geometry, use XkbAllocGeomSections.

           unsigned char           priority;    /* drawing priority, 0=>highest, 255=>lowest */
           short                   top;         /* top coordinate of section origin */
           short                   left;        /* left coordinate of row origin */
           unsigned short          width;       /* section width, in mm/10 */
           unsigned short          height;      /* section height, in mm/10 */
           short                   angle;       /* angle of section rotation, counterclockwise */
           unsigned short          num_rows;    /* number of rows in the rows array */
           unsigned short          num_doodads; /* number of doodads in the doodads array */
           unsigned short          num_overlays; /* number of overlays in the overlays array */
           unsigned short          sz_rows;      /* size of the rows array */
           unsigned short          sz_doodads;   /* size of the doodads array */
           unsigned short          sz_overlays;  /* size of the overlays array */
           XkbRowPtr               rows;         /* section rows array */
           XkbDoodadPtr            doodads;      /* section doodads array */
           XkbBoundsRec            bounds;       /* bounding box for the section, before rotation*/
           XkbOverlayPtr           overlays;     /* section overlays array */
       } XkbSectionRec, *XkbSectionPtr;

       top and left are the origin of the section, relative to the origin of the keyboard, in mm/10. angle is in 1/10 degrees.
