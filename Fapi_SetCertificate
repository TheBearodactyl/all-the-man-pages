NAME
       Fapi_SetCertificate - Fapi_SetCertificate

SYNOPSIS
   Functions
       TSS2_RC Fapi_SetCertificate (FAPI_CONTEXT *context, char const *path, char const *x509certData)
       TSS2_RC Fapi_SetCertificate_Async (FAPI_CONTEXT *context, char const *path, char const *x509certData)
       TSS2_RC Fapi_SetCertificate_Finish (FAPI_CONTEXT *context)

Detailed Description
       FAPI functions to invoke SetCertificate either as one-call or in an asynchronous manner.

Function Documentation
   TSS2_RC Fapi_SetCertificate (FAPI_CONTEXT * context, char const * path, char const * x509certData)
       One-Call function for Fapi_SetCertificate

       Sets an x509 cert into the path of a key.

       Parameters
           context The FAPI_CONTEXT
           path The path of the entity to be associated with the certificate
           x509certData The certificate that is associated with the entity. If this is NULL an existing certificate will be removed from the entity

       Return values
           TSS2_RC_SUCCESS if the function call was a success.
           TSS2_FAPI_RC_BAD_REFERENCE if context or path is NULL.
           TSS2_FAPI_RC_BAD_CONTEXT if context corruption is detected.
           TSS2_FAPI_RC_KEY_NOT_FOUND if path does not map to a FAPI entity.
           TSS2_FAPI_RC_BAD_KEY if x509certData is invalid.
           TSS2_FAPI_RC_BAD_SEQUENCE if the context has an asynchronous operation already pending.
           TSS2_FAPI_RC_IO_ERROR if the data cannot be saved.
           TSS2_FAPI_RC_MEMORY if the FAPI cannot allocate enough memory for internal operations or return parameters.
           TSS2_FAPI_RC_PATH_NOT_FOUND if a FAPI object path was not found during authorization.
           TSS2_FAPI_RC_BAD_VALUE if an invalid value was passed into the function.
           TSS2_FAPI_RC_TRY_AGAIN if an I/O operation is not finished yet and this function needs to be called again.
           TSS2_FAPI_RC_GENERAL_FAILURE if an internal error occurred.
           TSS2_ESYS_RC_* possible error codes of ESAPI.
           TSS2_FAPI_RC_NOT_PROVISIONED FAPI was not provisioned.
           TSS2_FAPI_RC_BAD_PATH if the path is used in inappropriate context or contains illegal characters.

   TSS2_RC Fapi_SetCertificate_Async (FAPI_CONTEXT * context, char const * path, char const * x509certData)
       Asynchronous function for Fapi_SetCertificate

       Sets an x509 cert into the path of a key.

       Call Fapi_SetCertificate_Finish to finish the execution of this command.

       Parameters
           context The FAPI_CONTEXT
           path The path of the entity to be associated with the certificate
           x509certData The certificate that is associated with the entity. If this is NULL an existing certificate will be removed from the entity

       Return values
           TSS2_RC_SUCCESS if the function call was a success.
           TSS2_FAPI_RC_BAD_REFERENCE if context or path is NULL.
           TSS2_FAPI_RC_BAD_CONTEXT if context corruption is detected.
           TSS2_FAPI_RC_KEY_NOT_FOUND if path does not map to a FAPI entity.
           TSS2_FAPI_RC_BAD_KEY if x509certData is invalid.
           TSS2_FAPI_RC_BAD_SEQUENCE if the context has an asynchronous operation already pending.
           TSS2_FAPI_RC_IO_ERROR if the data cannot be saved.
           TSS2_FAPI_RC_MEMORY if the FAPI cannot allocate enough memory for internal operations or return parameters.
           TSS2_FAPI_RC_PATH_NOT_FOUND if a FAPI object path was not found during authorization.
           TSS2_FAPI_RC_BAD_VALUE if an invalid value was passed into the function.
           TSS2_FAPI_RC_NOT_PROVISIONED FAPI was not provisioned.
           TSS2_FAPI_RC_BAD_PATH if the path is used in inappropriate context or contains illegal characters.

   TSS2_RC Fapi_SetCertificate_Finish (FAPI_CONTEXT * context)
       Asynchronous finish function for Fapi_SetCertificate

       This function should be called after a previous Fapi_SetCertificate_Async.

       Parameters
           context The FAPI_CONTEXT

       Return values
           TSS2_RC_SUCCESS if the function call was a success.
           TSS2_FAPI_RC_BAD_REFERENCE if context is NULL.
           TSS2_FAPI_RC_BAD_CONTEXT if context corruption is detected.
           TSS2_FAPI_RC_BAD_SEQUENCE if the context has an asynchronous operation already pending.
           TSS2_FAPI_RC_IO_ERROR if the data cannot be saved.
           TSS2_FAPI_RC_MEMORY if the FAPI cannot allocate enough memory for internal operations or return parameters.
           TSS2_FAPI_RC_TRY_AGAIN if the asynchronous operation is not yet complete. Call this function again later.
           TSS2_FAPI_RC_GENERAL_FAILURE if an internal error occurred.
           TSS2_FAPI_RC_BAD_VALUE if an invalid value was passed into the function.
           TSS2_ESYS_RC_* possible error codes of ESAPI.
           TSS2_FAPI_RC_BAD_PATH if the path is used in inappropriate context or contains illegal characters.
           TSS2_FAPI_RC_PATH_NOT_FOUND if a FAPI object path was not found during authorization.
