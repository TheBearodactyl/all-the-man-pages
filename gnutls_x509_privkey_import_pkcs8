NAME
       gnutls_x509_privkey_import_pkcs8 - API function

SYNOPSIS
       #include <gnutls/x509.h>

       int gnutls_x509_privkey_import_pkcs8(gnutls_x509_privkey_t key, const gnutls_datum_t * data, gnutls_x509_crt_fmt_t format, const char * password, unsigned int flags);

ARGUMENTS
       gnutls_x509_privkey_t key
                   The data to store the parsed key

       const gnutls_datum_t * data
                   The DER or PEM encoded key.

       gnutls_x509_crt_fmt_t format
                   One of DER or PEM

       const char * password
                   the password to decrypt the key (if it is encrypted).

       unsigned int flags
                   0 if encrypted or GNUTLS_PKCS_PLAIN if not encrypted.

DESCRIPTION
       This  function  will convert the given DER or PEM encoded PKCS8 2.0 encrypted key to the native gnutls_x509_privkey_t format. The output will be stored in  key .  Both RSA and DSA keys can be im‐
       ported, and flags can only be used to indicate an unencrypted key.

       The  password can be either ASCII or UTF-8 in the default PBES2 encryption schemas, or ASCII for the PKCS12 schemas.

       If the Certificate is PEM encoded it should have a header of "ENCRYPTED PRIVATE KEY", or "PRIVATE KEY". You only need to specify the flags if the key is DER encoded, since in that  case  the  en‐
       cryption status cannot be auto-detected.

       If the GNUTLS_PKCS_PLAIN flag is specified and the supplied data are encrypted then GNUTLS_E_DECRYPTION_FAILED is returned.

RETURNS
       On success, GNUTLS_E_SUCCESS (0) is returned, otherwise a negative error value.
