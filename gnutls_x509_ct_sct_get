NAME
       gnutls_x509_ct_sct_get - API function

SYNOPSIS
       #include <gnutls/x509-ext.h>

       int gnutls_x509_ct_sct_get(const gnutls_x509_ct_scts_t scts, unsigned idx, time_t * timestamp, gnutls_datum_t * logid, gnutls_sign_algorithm_t * sigalg, gnutls_datum_t * signature);

ARGUMENTS
       const gnutls_x509_ct_scts_t scts
                   A list of SCTs

       unsigned idx
                   The index of the target SCT in the list

       time_t * timestamp
                   The timestamp of the SCT

       gnutls_datum_t * logid
                   The LogID field of the SCT; must be freed with gnutls_free()

       gnutls_sign_algorithm_t * sigalg
                   The signature algorithm

       gnutls_datum_t * signature
                   The signature of the SCT; must be freed with gnutls_free()

DESCRIPTION
       This function will return a specific SCT (Signed Certificate Timestamp) stored in the SCT list  scts .

       The datums holding the SCT's LogId and signature will be allocated using gnutls_malloc().

RETURNS
       GNUTLS_E_SUCCESS (0) will be returned on success, GNUTLS_E_REQUESTED_DATA_NOT_AVAILABLE if  idx exceeds the number of SCTs in the list or a negative error value.
