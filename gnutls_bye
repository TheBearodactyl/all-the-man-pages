NAME
       gnutls_bye - API function

SYNOPSIS
       #include <gnutls/gnutls.h>

       int gnutls_bye(gnutls_session_t session, gnutls_close_request_t how);

ARGUMENTS
       gnutls_session_t session
                   is a gnutls_session_t type.

       gnutls_close_request_t how
                   is an integer

DESCRIPTION
       Terminates the current TLS/SSL connection. The connection should have been initiated using gnutls_handshake().   how should be one of GNUTLS_SHUT_RDWR, GNUTLS_SHUT_WR.

       In  case of GNUTLS_SHUT_RDWR the TLS session gets terminated and further receives and sends will be disallowed.  If the return value is zero you may continue using the underlying transport layer.
       GNUTLS_SHUT_RDWR sends an alert containing a close request and waits for the peer to reply with the same message.

       In case of GNUTLS_SHUT_WR the TLS session gets terminated and further sends will be disallowed. In order to reuse the connection you should wait for an EOF from the peer.  GNUTLS_SHUT_WR sends an
       alert containing a close request.

       Note  that  not all implementations will properly terminate a TLS connection.  Some of them, usually for performance reasons, will terminate only the underlying transport layer, and thus not dis‐
       tinguishing between a malicious party prematurely terminating the connection and normal termination.

       This function may also return GNUTLS_E_AGAIN or GNUTLS_E_INTERRUPTED; cf.  gnutls_record_get_direction().

RETURNS
       GNUTLS_E_SUCCESS on success, or an error code, see function documentation for entire semantics.
