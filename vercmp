NAME
       vercmp - version comparison utility

SYNOPSIS
       vercmp [-h] [--help] <version1> <version2>

DESCRIPTION
       vercmp is used to determine the relationship between two given version numbers. It outputs values as follows:

       •   < 0 : if ver1 < ver2

       •   = 0 : if ver1 == ver2

       •   > 0 : if ver1 > ver2

       Version comparison operates as follows:

           Alphanumeric:
             1.0a < 1.0b < 1.0beta < 1.0p < 1.0pre < 1.0rc < 1.0 < 1.0.a < 1.0.1
           Numeric:
             1 < 1.0 < 1.1 < 1.1.1 < 1.2 < 2.0 < 3.0.0

       Additionally, version strings can have an epoch value defined that will overrule any version comparison, unless the epoch values are equal. This is specified in an epoch:version-rel format. For
       example, 2:1.0-1 is always greater than 1:3.6-1.

       Keep in mind that the pkgrel is only compared if it is available on both versions given to this tool. For example, comparing 1.5-1 and 1.5 will yield 0; comparing 1.5-1 and 1.5-2 will yield < 0
       as expected. This is mainly for supporting versioned dependencies that do not include the pkgrel.

OPTIONS
       -h, --help
           Display summary of the available return codes. Must be the first option specified.

EXAMPLES
           $ vercmp 1 2
           -1

           $ vercmp 2 1
           1

           $ vercmp 2.0-1 1.7-6
           1

           $ vercmp 2.0 2.0-13
           0

           $ vercmp 4.34 1:001
           -1
