NAME
       hwlocality_syntheticexport - Exporting Topologies to Synthetic

SYNOPSIS
   Enumerations
       enum hwloc_topology_export_synthetic_flags_e { HWLOC_TOPOLOGY_EXPORT_SYNTHETIC_FLAG_NO_EXTENDED_TYPES, HWLOC_TOPOLOGY_EXPORT_SYNTHETIC_FLAG_NO_ATTRS, HWLOC_TOPOLOGY_EXPORT_SYNTHETIC_FLAG_V1,
           HWLOC_TOPOLOGY_EXPORT_SYNTHETIC_FLAG_IGNORE_MEMORY }

   Functions
       int hwloc_topology_export_synthetic (hwloc_topology_t topology, char *buffer, size_t buflen, unsigned long flags)

Detailed Description
Enumeration Type Documentation
   enum hwloc_topology_export_synthetic_flags_e
       Flags for exporting synthetic topologies. Flags to be given as a OR'ed set to hwloc_topology_export_synthetic().

       Enumerator

       HWLOC_TOPOLOGY_EXPORT_SYNTHETIC_FLAG_NO_EXTENDED_TYPES
              Export extended types such as L2dcache as basic types such as Cache. This is required if loading the synthetic description with hwloc < 1.9.

       HWLOC_TOPOLOGY_EXPORT_SYNTHETIC_FLAG_NO_ATTRS
              Do not export level attributes. Ignore level attributes such as memory/cache sizes or PU indexes. This is required if loading the synthetic description with hwloc < 1.10.

       HWLOC_TOPOLOGY_EXPORT_SYNTHETIC_FLAG_V1
              Export the memory hierarchy as expected in hwloc 1.x. Instead of attaching memory children to levels, export single NUMA node child as normal intermediate levels, when possible. This is
              required if loading the synthetic description with hwloc 1.x. However this may fail if some objects have multiple local NUMA nodes.

       HWLOC_TOPOLOGY_EXPORT_SYNTHETIC_FLAG_IGNORE_MEMORY
              Do not export memory information. Only export the actual hierarchy of normal CPU-side objects and ignore where memory is attached. This is useful for when the hierarchy of CPUs is what
              really matters, but it behaves as if there was a single machine-wide NUMA node.

Function Documentation
   int hwloc_topology_export_synthetic (hwloc_topology_t topology, char * buffer, size_t buflen, unsigned long flags)
       Export the topology as a synthetic string. At most buflen characters will be written in buffer, including the terminating \0.

       This exported string may be given back to hwloc_topology_set_synthetic().

       flags is a OR'ed set of hwloc_topology_export_synthetic_flags_e.

       Returns
           The number of characters that were written, not including the terminating \0.

           -1 if the topology could not be exported, for instance if it is not symmetric.

       Note
           I/O and Misc children are ignored, the synthetic string only describes normal children.

           A 1024-byte buffer should be large enough for exporting topologies in the vast majority of cases.
