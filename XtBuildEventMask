NAME
       XtBuildEventMask - retrieve a widget's event mask

SYNTAX
       #include <X11/Intrinsic.h>

       EventMask XtBuildEventMask(Widget w);

ARGUMENTS
       w         Specifies the widget.

DESCRIPTION
       The XtBuildEventMask function returns the event mask representing the logical OR of all event masks for event handlers registered on the widget with XtAddEventHandler and all event translations,
       including accelerators, installed on the widget.  This is the same event mask stored into the XSetWindowAttributes structure by XtRealizeWidget and sent to the server when event handlers and
       translations are installed or removed on the realized widget.
