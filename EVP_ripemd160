NAME
       EVP_ripemd160 - RIPEMD160 For EVP

SYNOPSIS
        #include <openssl/evp.h>

        const EVP_MD *EVP_ripemd160(void);

DESCRIPTION
       RIPEMD-160 is a cryptographic hash function first published in 1996 belonging to the RIPEMD family (RACE Integrity Primitives Evaluation Message Digest).  This implementation is only available
       with the legacy provider.

       EVP_ripemd160()
           The RIPEMD-160 algorithm which produces a 160-bit output from a given input.

RETURN VALUES
       These functions return a EVP_MD structure that contains the implementation of the message digest. See EVP_MD_meth_new(3) for details of the EVP_MD structure.

CONFORMING TO
       ISO/IEC 10118-3:2016 Dedicated Hash-Function 1 (RIPEMD-160).
