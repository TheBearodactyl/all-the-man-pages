SYNOPSIS
       #include <gnutls/pkcs7.h>

       int gnutls_pkcs7_get_crt_raw(gnutls_pkcs7_t pkcs7, unsigned indx, void * certificate, size_t * certificate_size);

ARGUMENTS
       gnutls_pkcs7_t pkcs7
                   should contain a gnutls_pkcs7_t type

       unsigned indx
                   contains the index of the certificate to extract

       void * certificate
                   the contents of the certificate will be copied there (may be null)

       size_t * certificate_size
                   should hold the size of the certificate

DESCRIPTION
       This function will return a certificate of the PKCS7 or RFC2630 certificate set.
