NAME
       gnutls_x509_crt_verify_data2 - API function

SYNOPSIS
       #include <gnutls/x509.h>

       int gnutls_x509_crt_verify_data2(gnutls_x509_crt_t crt, gnutls_sign_algorithm_t algo, unsigned int flags, const gnutls_datum_t * data, const gnutls_datum_t * signature);

ARGUMENTS
       gnutls_x509_crt_t crt
                   Holds the certificate to verify with

       gnutls_sign_algorithm_t algo
                   The signature algorithm used

       unsigned int flags
                   Zero or an OR list of gnutls_certificate_verify_flags

       const gnutls_datum_t * data
                   holds the signed data

       const gnutls_datum_t * signature
                   contains the signature

DESCRIPTION
       This function will verify the given signed data, using the parameters from the certificate.

RETURNS
       In  case  of a verification failure GNUTLS_E_PK_SIG_VERIFY_FAILED is returned, GNUTLS_E_EXPIRED or GNUTLS_E_NOT_YET_ACTIVATED on expired or not yet activated certificate and zero or positive code
       on success.

       Note that since GnuTLS 3.5.6 this function introduces checks in the end certificate ( crt ), including time checks and key usage checks.

SINCE
       3.4.0
