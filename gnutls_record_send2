NAME
       gnutls_record_send2 - API function

SYNOPSIS
       #include <gnutls/gnutls.h>

       ssize_t gnutls_record_send2(gnutls_session_t session, const void * data, size_t data_size, size_t pad, unsigned flags);

ARGUMENTS
       gnutls_session_t session
                   is a gnutls_session_t type.

       const void * data
                   contains the data to send

       size_t data_size
                   is the length of the data

       size_t pad  padding to be added to the record

       unsigned flags
                   must be zero

DESCRIPTION
       This  function  is  identical  to  gnutls_record_send()  except  that  it  takes  an  extra  argument  to  specify  padding  to be added the record.  To determine the maximum size of padding, use
       gnutls_record_get_max_size() and gnutls_record_overhead_size().

       Note that in order for GnuTLS to provide constant time processing of padding and data in TLS1.3, the flag GNUTLS_SAFE_PADDING_CHECK must be used in gnutls_init().

RETURNS
       The number of bytes sent, or a negative error code.  The number of bytes sent might be less than  data_size .  The maximum number of bytes this function can send in a single call depends  on  the
       negotiated maximum record size.

SINCE
       3.6.3
