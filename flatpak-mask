FLATPAK MASK(1)                                                                                flatpak mask                                                                                FLATPAK MASK(1)

NAME
       flatpak-mask - Mask out updates and automatic installation

SYNOPSIS
       flatpak mask [OPTION...] PATTERN...

DESCRIPTION
       Flatpak maintains a list of patterns that define which refs are masked. A masked ref will never be updated or automatically installed (for example a masked extension marked auto-download will not
       be downloaded). You can still manually install such refs, but once they are installed the version will be pinned.

       The patterns are just a partial ref, with the * character matching anything within that part of the ref. Here are some example patterns:

           org.some.App
           org.some.App//unstable
           app/org.domain.*
           org.some.App/arm

       To list the current set of masks, run this command without any patterns.

OPTIONS
       The following options are understood:

       -h, --help
           Show help options and exit.

       --remove
           Instead of adding the patterns, remove matching patterns.

       -u, --user
           Mask refs in a per-user installation.

       --system
           Mask refs in the default system-wide installation.

       --installation=NAME
           Mask refs in a system-wide installation specified by NAME among those defined in /etc/flatpak/installations.d/. Using --installation=default is equivalent to using --system.

       -v, --verbose
           Print debug information during command processing.

EXAMPLES
       $ flatpak mask

       $ flatpak mask org.broken.App

       $ flatpak mask --remove org.broken.App
