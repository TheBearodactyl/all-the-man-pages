PROLOG

       the interface may not be implemented on Linux.

NAME
       tsort — topological sort

SYNOPSIS
       tsort [file]

DESCRIPTION
       The tsort utility shall write to standard output a totally ordered list of items consistent with a partial ordering of items contained in the input.

       The application shall ensure that the input consists of pairs of items (non-empty strings) separated by <blank> characters. Pairs of different items indicate ordering. Pairs  of  identical  items
       indicate presence, but not ordering.

OPTIONS
       None.

OPERANDS
       The following operand shall be supported:

       file      A pathname of a text file to order. If no file operand is given, the standard input shall be used.

STDIN
       The  standard  input  shall  be used if no file operand is specified, and shall be used if the file operand is '-' and the implementation treats the '-' as meaning standard input.  Otherwise, the
       standard input shall not be used.  See the INPUT FILES section.

INPUT FILES
       The input file shall be a text file.

ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
       The following environment variables shall affect the execution of tsort:

       LANG      Provide a default value for the internationalization variables that are unset or null. (See the Base Definitions volume of POSIX.1‐2017, Section 8.2, Internationalization Variables  for
                 the precedence of internationalization variables used to determine the values of locale categories.)

       LC_ALL    If set to a non-empty string value, override the values of all the other internationalization variables.

       LC_CTYPE  Determine the locale for the interpretation of sequences of bytes of text data as characters (for example, single-byte as opposed to multi-byte characters in arguments and input files).

       LC_MESSAGES
                 Determine the locale that should be used to affect the format and contents of diagnostic messages written to standard error.

       NLSPATH   Determine the location of message catalogs for the processing of LC_MESSAGES.

ASYNCHRONOUS EVENTS
       Default.

STDOUT
       The standard output shall be a text file consisting of the order list produced from the partially ordered input.

STDERR
       The standard error shall be used only for diagnostic messages.

OUTPUT FILES
       None.

EXTENDED DESCRIPTION
       None.

EXIT STATUS
       The following exit values shall be returned:

        0    Successful completion.

       >0    An error occurred.

CONSEQUENCES OF ERRORS
       Default.

       The following sections are informative.

APPLICATION USAGE
       The LC_COLLATE variable need not affect the actions of tsort.  The output ordering is not lexicographic, but depends on the pairs of items given as input.

EXAMPLES
       The command:

           tsort <<EOF
           a b c c d e
           g g
           f g e f
           h h
           EOF

       produces the output:

           a
           b
           c
           d
           e
           f
           g
           h

RATIONALE
       None.

FUTURE DIRECTIONS
       None.
