NAME
       systemd-poweroff.service, systemd-halt.service, systemd-reboot.service,
       systemd-kexec.service, systemd-shutdown - System shutdown logic

SYNOPSIS
       systemd-poweroff.service

       systemd-halt.service

       systemd-reboot.service

       systemd-kexec.service

       /usr/lib/systemd/systemd-shutdown

       /usr/lib/systemd/system-shutdown/

DESCRIPTION
       systemd-poweroff.service is a system service that is pulled in by
       poweroff.target and is responsible for the actual system power-off
       operation. Similarly, systemd-halt.service is pulled in by halt.target,
       systemd-reboot.service by reboot.target and systemd-kexec.service by
       kexec.target to execute the respective actions.

       When these services are run, they ensure that PID 1 is replaced by the
       /usr/lib/systemd/systemd-shutdown tool which is then responsible for
       the actual shutdown. Before shutting down, this binary will try to
       unmount all remaining file systems, disable all remaining swap devices,
       detach all remaining storage devices and kill all remaining processes.

       It is necessary to have this code in a separate binary because
       otherwise rebooting after an upgrade might be broken â€” the running PID
       1 could still depend on libraries which are not available any more,
       thus keeping the file system busy, which then cannot be re-mounted
       read-only.

       Immediately before executing the actual system
       power-off/halt/reboot/kexec systemd-shutdown will run all executables
       in /usr/lib/systemd/system-shutdown/ and pass one arguments to them:
       either "poweroff", "halt", "reboot", or "kexec", depending on the
       chosen action. All executables in this directory are executed in
       parallel, and execution of the action is not continued before all
       executables finished.

       Note that systemd-poweroff.service (and the related units) should never
       be executed directly. Instead, trigger system shutdown with a command
       such as "systemctl poweroff".
