NAME
       gnutls_memcmp - API function

SYNOPSIS
       #include <gnutls/gnutls.h>

       int gnutls_memcmp(const void * s1, const void * s2, size_t n);

ARGUMENTS
       const void * s1
                   the first address to compare

       const void * s2
                   the second address to compare

       size_t n    the size of memory to compare

DESCRIPTION
       This function will operate similarly to memcmp(), but will operate on time that depends only on the size of the string. That is will not return early if the strings don't match on the first byte.

RETURNS
       non zero on difference and zero if the buffers are identical.

SINCE
       3.4.0
