Detailed Description
       Flags describing actual memory binding support for this topology.

       A flag may be set even if the feature isn't supported in all cases (e.g. binding to random sets of non-contiguous objects).

Field Documentation
   unsigned char hwloc_topology_membind_support::alloc_membind
       Allocating a bound memory area is supported.

   unsigned char hwloc_topology_membind_support::bind_membind

   unsigned char hwloc_topology_membind_support::firsttouch_membind
       First-touch policy is supported.

   unsigned char hwloc_topology_membind_support::get_area_membind
       Getting the binding of a given memory area is supported.

   unsigned char hwloc_topology_membind_support::get_area_memlocation
       Getting the last NUMA nodes where a memory area was allocated is supported

   unsigned char hwloc_topology_membind_support::get_proc_membind
       Getting the binding of a whole given process is supported.

   unsigned char hwloc_topology_membind_support::get_thisproc_membind
       Getting the binding of the whole current process is supported.

   unsigned char hwloc_topology_membind_support::get_thisthread_membind
       Getting the binding of the current thread only is supported.

   unsigned char hwloc_topology_membind_support::interleave_membind

   unsigned char hwloc_topology_membind_support::migrate_membind
       Migration flags is supported.

   unsigned char hwloc_topology_membind_support::nexttouch_membind
       Next-touch migration policy is supported.

   unsigned char hwloc_topology_membind_support::set_area_membind
       Binding a given memory area is supported.

   unsigned char hwloc_topology_membind_support::set_proc_membind
       Binding a whole given process is supported.

   unsigned char hwloc_topology_membind_support::set_thisproc_membind
       Binding the whole current process is supported.

   unsigned char hwloc_topology_membind_support::set_thisthread_membind
       Binding the current thread only is supported.
