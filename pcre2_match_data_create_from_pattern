NAME
       PCRE2 - Perl-compatible regular expressions (revised API)

SYNOPSIS

       #include <pcre2.h>

       pcre2_match_data *pcre2_match_data_create_from_pattern(
         const pcre2_code *code, pcre2_general_context *gcontext);

DESCRIPTION

       This  function creates a new match data block for holding the result of
       a match.  The first argument points to a compiled pattern.  The  number
       of capturing parentheses within the pattern is used to compute the num‐
       ber of pairs of offsets that are required  in  the  match  data  block.
       These  form  the "output vector" (ovector) within the match data block,
       and are used to identify the matched string and any captured substrings
       when  matching  with pcre2_match(). If you are using pcre2_dfa_match(),
       which uses the output  vector  in  a  different  way,  you  should  use
       pcre2_match_data_create() instead of this function.

       The second argument points to a general context, for custom memory man‐
       agement, or is NULL to use the same memory allocator as  was  used  for
       the  compiled pattern. The result of the function is NULL if the memory
       for the block could not be obtained.

       There is a complete description of the PCRE2 native API in the pcre2api
       page and a description of the POSIX API in the pcre2posix page.
