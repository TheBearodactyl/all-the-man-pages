NAME
       wctype - wide-character classification

LIBRARY
       Standard C library (libc, -lc)

SYNOPSIS
       #include <wctype.h>

       wctype_t wctype(const char *name);

DESCRIPTION
       The wctype_t type represents a property which a wide character may or may not have.  In other words, it represents a class of wide characters.  This type's nature is implementation-dependent, but
       the special value (wctype_t) 0 denotes an invalid property.  Nonzero wctype_t values can be passed to the iswctype(3) function to actually test whether a given wide character has the property.

       The wctype() function returns a property, given by its name.  The set of valid names depends on the LC_CTYPE category of the current locale, but the following names are valid in all locales.

           "alnum" - realizes the isalnum(3) classification function
           "alpha" - realizes the isalpha(3) classification function
           "blank" - realizes the isblank(3) classification function
           "cntrl" - realizes the iscntrl(3) classification function
           "digit" - realizes the isdigit(3) classification function
           "graph" - realizes the isgraph(3) classification function
           "lower" - realizes the islower(3) classification function
           "print" - realizes the isprint(3) classification function
           "punct" - realizes the ispunct(3) classification function
           "space" - realizes the isspace(3) classification function
           "upper" - realizes the isupper(3) classification function
           "xdigit" - realizes the isxdigit(3) classification function

RETURN VALUE
       The wctype() function returns a property descriptor if the name is valid.  Otherwise, it returns (wctype_t) 0.

NAME
       wctype, wctype_l — define character class

SYNOPSIS
       #include <wctype.h>

       wctype_t wctype(const char *property);
       wctype_t wctype_l(const char *property, locale_t locale);

DESCRIPTION
       For wctype(): The functionality described on this reference page is aligned with the ISO C standard. Any conflict between the requirements described here and the ISO C standard is  unintentional.
       This volume of POSIX.1‐2017 defers to the ISO C standard.

       The wctype() and wctype_l() functions are defined for valid character class names as defined in the current locale or in the locale represented by locale, respectively.

       The  property  argument  is a string identifying a generic character class for which codeset-specific type information is required. The following character class names shall be defined in all lo‐
       cales:

              alnum   digit   punct
              alpha   graph   space
              blank   lower   upper
              cntrl   print   xdigit

       Additional character class names defined in the locale definition file (category LC_CTYPE) can also be specified.

       These functions shall return a value of type wctype_t, which can be used as the second argument to subsequent calls of iswctype() and iswctype_l().

       The wctype() and wctype_l() functions shall determine values of wctype_t according to the rules of the coded character set defined by character type information in the current locale  or  in  the
       locale represented by locale, respectively (category LC_CTYPE).

       The values returned by wctype() shall be valid until a call to setlocale() that modifies the category LC_CTYPE.

       The values returned by wctype_l() shall be valid only in calls to iswctype_l() with a locale represented by locale with the same LC_CTYPE category value.

       The behavior is undefined if the locale argument to wctype_l() is the special locale object LC_GLOBAL_LOCALE or is not a valid locale object handle.

RETURN VALUE
       The  wctype() and wctype_l() functions shall return 0 if the given character class name is not valid for the current locale (category LC_CTYPE); otherwise, they shall return an object of type wc‐
       type_t that can be used in calls to iswctype() and iswctype_l().
