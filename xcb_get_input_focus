SYNOPSIS
       #include <xcb/xproto.h>

   Request function
       xcb_get_input_focus_cookie_t xcb_get_input_focus(xcb_connection_t *conn,

   Reply datastructure
       typedef struct xcb_get_input_focus_reply_t {
           uint8_t      response_type;
           uint8_t      revert_to;
           uint16_t     sequence;
           uint32_t     length;
           xcb_window_t focus;
       } xcb_get_input_focus_reply_t;

   Reply function
       xcb_get_input_focus_reply_t *xcb_get_input_focus_reply(xcb_connection_t *conn, xcb_get_input_focus_cookie_t cookie, xcb_generic_error_t **e);

REQUEST ARGUMENTS
       conn      The XCB connection to X11.

REPLY FIELDS
       response_type
                 The type of this reply, in this case XCB_GET_INPUT_FOCUS. This field is also present in the xcb_generic_reply_t and can be used to tell replies apart from each other.

       sequence  The sequence number of the last request processed by the X11 server.

       length    The length of the reply, in words (a word is 4 bytes).

       revert_to One of the following values:

                 XCB_INPUT_FOCUS_NONE
                           The focus reverts to XCB_NONE, so no window will have the input focus.

                 XCB_INPUT_FOCUS_POINTER_ROOT
                           The focus reverts to XCB_POINTER_ROOT respectively. When the focus reverts, FocusIn and FocusOut events are generated, but the last-focus-change time is not changed.

                 XCB_INPUT_FOCUS_PARENT
                           The focus reverts to the parent (or closest viewable ancestor) and the new revert_to value is XCB_INPUT_FOCUS_NONE.

                 XCB_INPUT_FOCUS_FOLLOW_KEYBOARD
                           NOT YET DOCUMENTED. Only relevant for the xinput extension.
                 TODO: NOT YET DOCUMENTED.

       focus     TODO: NOT YET DOCUMENTED.

DESCRIPTION
RETURN VALUE
       Returns an xcb_get_input_focus_cookie_t. Errors have to be handled when calling the reply function xcb_get_input_focus_reply.

       If you want to handle errors in the event loop instead, use xcb_get_input_focus_unchecked. See xcb-requests(3) for details.

ERRORS
       This request does never generate any errors.
