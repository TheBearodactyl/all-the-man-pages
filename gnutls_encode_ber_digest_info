NAME
       gnutls_encode_ber_digest_info - API function

SYNOPSIS
       #include <gnutls/crypto.h>

       int gnutls_encode_ber_digest_info(gnutls_digest_algorithm_t hash, const gnutls_datum_t * digest, gnutls_datum_t * output);

ARGUMENTS
       gnutls_digest_algorithm_t hash
                   the hash algorithm that was used to get the digest

       const gnutls_datum_t * digest
                   must contain the digest data

       gnutls_datum_t * output
                   will contain the allocated DigestInfo BER encoded data

DESCRIPTION
       This function will encode the provided digest data, and its algorithm into an RSA PKCS1 1.5 DigestInfo structure.

RETURNS
       On success, GNUTLS_E_SUCCESS (0) is returned, otherwise an error code is returned.

SINCE
       3.5.0
