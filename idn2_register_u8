NAME
       idn2_register_u8 - API function

SYNOPSIS
       #include <idn2.h>

       int idn2_register_u8(const uint8_t * ulabel, const uint8_t * alabel, uint8_t ** insertname, int flags);

ARGUMENTS
       const uint8_t * ulabel
                   input zero-terminated UTF-8 and Unicode NFC string, or NULL.

       const uint8_t * alabel
                   input zero-terminated ACE encoded string (xn--), or NULL.

       uint8_t ** insertname
                   newly allocated output variable with name to register in DNS.

       int flags   optional idn2_flags to modify behaviour.

DESCRIPTION
       Perform  IDNA2008  register  string conversion on domain label  ulabel and  alabel , as described in section 4 of RFC 5891.  Note that the input  ulabel must be encoded in UTF-8 and be in Unicode
       NFC form.

       Pass IDN2_NFC_INPUT in  flags to convert input  ulabel to NFC form before further processing.

       It is recommended to supply both  ulabel and  alabel for better error checking, but supplying just one of them will work.  Passing in only  alabel is better than only  ulabel .  See RFC 5891 sec‐
       tion 4 for more information.

       After version 0.11:  insertname may be NULL to test conversion of  src without allocating memory.

RETURNS
       On  successful  conversion  IDN2_OK  is  returned,  when  the  given   ulabel and  alabel does not match each other IDN2_UALABEL_MISMATCH is returned, when either of the input labels are too long
       IDN2_TOO_BIG_LABEL is returned, when  alabel does does not appear to be a proper A-label IDN2_INVALID_ALABEL is returned, or another error code is returned.
