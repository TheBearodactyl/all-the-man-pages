NAME
       ustat - get filesystem statistics

LIBRARY
       Standard C library (libc, -lc)

SYNOPSIS
       #include <sys/types.h>
       #include <unistd.h>    /* libc[45] */
       #include <ustat.h>     /* glibc2 */

       [[deprecated]] int ustat(dev_t dev, struct ustat *ubuf);

DESCRIPTION
       ustat()  returns  information  about  a mounted filesystem.  dev is a device number identifying a device containing a mounted filesystem.  ubuf is a pointer to a ustat structure that contains the
       following members:

           daddr_t f_tfree;      /* Total free blocks */
           ino_t   f_tinode;     /* Number of free inodes */
           char    f_fname[6];   /* Filsys name */
           char    f_fpack[6];   /* Filsys pack name */

       The last two fields, f_fname and f_fpack, are not implemented and will always be filled with null bytes ('\0').

RETURN VALUE
       On success, zero is returned and the ustat structure pointed to by ubuf will be filled in.  On error, -1 is returned, and errno is set to indicate the error.

ERRORS
       EFAULT ubuf points outside of your accessible address space.

       EINVAL dev does not refer to a device containing a mounted filesystem.

       ENOSYS The mounted filesystem referenced by dev does not support this operation, or any version of Linux before Linux 1.3.16.

STANDARDS
       None.

HISTORY
       SVr4.  Removed in glibc 2.28.

       ustat() is deprecated and has been provided only for compatibility.  All new programs should use statfs(2) instead.

   HP-UX notes
       The HP-UX version of the ustat structure has an additional field, f_blksize, that is unknown elsewhere.  HP-UX warns: For some filesystems, the number  of  free  inodes  does  not  change.   Such
       filesystems will return -1 in the field f_tinode.  For some filesystems, inodes are dynamically allocated.  Such filesystems will return the current number of free inodes.
