DESCRIPTION
       ldns_buffer_limit() returns the maximum size of the buffer \param[in] buffer
              Returns the size

       ldns_buffer_set_limit() changes the buffer's limit.  If the buffer's position is greater than the new limit the position is set to the limit.
              buffer: the buffer
              limit: the new limit

       ldns_buffer_capacity() returns the number of bytes the buffer can hold.
              buffer: the buffer
              Returns the number of bytes

       ldns_buffer_set_capacity() changes the buffer's capacity.  The data is reallocated so any pointers to the data may become invalid.  The buffer's limit is set to the buffer's new capacity.
              buffer: the buffer
              capacity: the capacity to use
              Returns whether this failed or succeeded

       ldns_buffer_reserve() ensures BUFFER can contain at least AMOUNT more bytes.  The buffer's capacity is increased if necessary using buffer_set_capacity().

              The buffer's limit is always set to the (possibly increased) capacity.
              buffer: the buffer
              amount: amount to use
              Returns whether this failed or succeeded

       ldns_buffer_at() returns a pointer to the data at the indicated position.
              buffer: the buffer
              at: position
              Returns the pointer to the data

       ldns_buffer_begin() returns a pointer to the beginning of the buffer (the data at position 0).
              buffer: the buffer
              Returns the pointer

       ldns_buffer_end() returns a pointer to the end of the buffer (the data at the buffer's limit).
              buffer: the buffer
              Returns the pointer

       ldns_buffer_current() returns a pointer to the data at the buffer's current position.
              buffer: the buffer
              Returns the pointer
