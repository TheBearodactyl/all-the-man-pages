NAME
       gnutls_crypto_register_mac - API function

SYNOPSIS
       #include <gnutls/crypto.h>

       int  gnutls_crypto_register_mac(gnutls_mac_algorithm_t  algorithm,  int priority, gnutls_mac_init_func init, gnutls_mac_setkey_func setkey, gnutls_mac_setnonce_func setnonce, gnutls_mac_hash_func
       hash, gnutls_mac_output_func output, gnutls_mac_deinit_func deinit, gnutls_mac_fast_func hash_fast);

ARGUMENTS
       gnutls_mac_algorithm_t algorithm
                   is the gnutls MAC identifier

       int priority
                   is the priority of the algorithm

       gnutls_mac_init_func init
                   A function which initializes the MAC

       gnutls_mac_setkey_func setkey
                   A function which sets the key of the MAC

       gnutls_mac_setnonce_func setnonce
                   A function which sets the nonce for the mac (may be NULL for common MAC algorithms)

       gnutls_mac_hash_func hash
                   Perform the hash operation

       gnutls_mac_output_func output
                   Provide the output of the MAC

       gnutls_mac_deinit_func deinit
                   A function which deinitializes the MAC

       gnutls_mac_fast_func hash_fast
                   Perform the MAC operation in one go

DESCRIPTION
       This function will register a MAC algorithm to be used by gnutls.  Any algorithm registered will override the included algorithms and by convention kernel implemented algorithms have priority  of
       90 and CPU-assisted of 80.  The algorithm with the lowest priority will be used by gnutls.

DEPRECATED
       since 3.7.0 it is no longer possible to override cipher implementation

RETURNS
       GNUTLS_E_SUCCESS on success, otherwise a negative error code.

SINCE
       3.4.0
