SYNOPSIS
        #include <openssl/evp.h>

        const EVP_CIPHER *EVP_ciphername(void)

       EVP_ciphername is used a placeholder for any of the described cipher functions, such as EVP_camellia_128_cbc.

DESCRIPTION
       The Camellia encryption algorithm for EVP.

       EVP_camellia_256_ofb()
           Camellia for 128, 192 and 256 bit keys in the following modes: CBC, CFB with 128-bit shift, CFB with 1-bit shift, CFB with 8-bit shift, CTR, ECB and OFB.

RETURN VALUES
       These functions return an EVP_CIPHER structure that contains the implementation of the symmetric cipher. See EVP_CIPHER_meth_new(3) for details of the EVP_CIPHER structure.
