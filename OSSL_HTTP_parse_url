OSSL_HTTP_PARSE_URL(3ssl)           OpenSSL          OSSL_HTTP_PARSE_URL(3ssl)

NAME
       OSSL_HTTP_adapt_proxy, OSSL_parse_url, OSSL_HTTP_parse_url,
       OCSP_parse_url - http utility functions

SYNOPSIS
        #include <openssl/http.h>

        const char *OSSL_HTTP_adapt_proxy(const char *proxy, const char *no_proxy,
                                          const char *server, int use_ssl);

        int OSSL_parse_url(const char *url, char **pscheme, char **puser, char **phost,
                           char **pport, int *pport_num,
                           char **ppath, char **pquery, char **pfrag);
        int OSSL_HTTP_parse_url(const char *url,
                                int *pssl, char **puser, char **phost,
                                char **pport, int *pport_num,
                                char **ppath, char **pquery, char **pfrag);

       The following functions have been deprecated since OpenSSL 3.0, and can
       be hidden entirely by defining OPENSSL_API_COMPAT with a suitable
       version value, see openssl_user_macros(7):

        int OCSP_parse_url(const char *url, char **phost, char **pport, char **ppath,
                           int *pssl);

DESCRIPTION
       OSSL_HTTP_adapt_proxy() takes an optional proxy hostname proxy and
       returns it transformed according to the optional no_proxy parameter,
       server, use_ssl, and the applicable environment variable, as follows.
       If proxy is NULL, take any default value from the "http_proxy"
       environment variable, or from "https_proxy" if use_ssl is nonzero.  If
       this still does not yield a proxy hostname, take any further default
       value from the "HTTP_PROXY" environment variable, or from "HTTPS_PROXY"
       if use_ssl is nonzero.  If no_proxy is NULL, take any default exclusion
       value from the "no_proxy" environment variable, or else from
       "NO_PROXY".  Return the determined proxy hostname unless the exclusion
       contains server.  Otherwise return NULL.

       OSSL_parse_url() parses its input string url as a URL of the form
       "[scheme://][userinfo@]host[:port][/path][?query][#fragment]" and
       splits it up into scheme, userinfo, host, port, path, query, and
       fragment components.  The host (or server) component may be a DNS name
       or an IP address where IPv6 addresses should be enclosed in square
       brackets "[" and "]".  The port component is optional and defaults to
       0.  If given, it must be in decimal form.  If the pport_num argument is
       not NULL the integer value of the port number is assigned to *pport_num
       on success.  The path component is also optional and defaults to "/".
       Each non-NULL result pointer argument pscheme, puser, phost, pport,
       ppath, pquery, and pfrag, is assigned the respective url component.  On
       success, they are guaranteed to contain non-NULL string pointers, else
       NULL.  It is the reponsibility of the caller to free them using
       OPENSSL_free(3).  If pquery is NULL, any given query component is
       handled as part of the path.  A string returned via *ppath is
       guaranteed to begin with a "/" character.  For absent scheme, userinfo,
       port, query, and fragment components an empty string is provided.

       OSSL_HTTP_parse_url() is a special form of OSSL_parse_url() where the
       scheme, if given, must be "http" or "https".  If pssl is not NULL,
       *pssl is assigned 1 in case parsing was successful and the scheme is
       "https", else 0.  The port component is optional and defaults to 443 if
       the scheme is "https", else 80.  Note that relative paths must be given
       with a leading "/", otherwise the first path element is interpreted as
       the hostname.

       Calling the deprecated function OCSP_parse_url(url, host, port, path,
       ssl) is equivalent to OSSL_HTTP_parse_url(url, ssl, NULL, host, port,
       NULL, path, NULL, NULL).

RETURN VALUES
       OSSL_HTTP_adapt_proxy() returns NULL if no proxy is to be used,
       otherwise a constant proxy hostname string, which is either the proxy
       name handed in or an environment variable value.

       OSSL_parse_url(), OSSL_HTTP_parse_url(), and OCSP_parse_url() return 1
       on success, 0 on error.

HISTORY
       OSSL_HTTP_adapt_proxy(), OSSL_parse_url() and OSSL_HTTP_parse_url()
       were added in OpenSSL 3.0.  OCSP_parse_url() was deprecated in OpenSSL
       3.0.
