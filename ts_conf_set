NAME
       ts_conf_set - write a new TSLIB_CONFFILE config file and reload it.

SYNOPSIS
       #include <tslib.h>

       int ts_conf_set(struct ts_module_conf *conf);

DESCRIPTION
       ts_conf_set()  This  function  takes  a  pointer  to a struct ts_module_conf. It reads data from all linked structs in the list (next and prev pointers) and writes a new TSLIB_CONFFILE. The first
       struct in the list (where prev is NULL) is the first line and so on. After writing, ts_reconfig() has to be called so the new modules and parameters are reloaded and applied to the currently run‚Äê
       ning program.

       The given set of ts_module_conf structs is freed and destroyed here.  After calling ts_conf_set() one has to use ts_conf_get() again, for a different change.

       struct ts_module_conf {
            char *name;
            char *params;
            int raw;
            int nr;

            struct ts_module_conf *next;
            struct ts_module_conf *prev;
       };

RETURN VALUE
       This function returns zero on success and a negative integer on failure.
