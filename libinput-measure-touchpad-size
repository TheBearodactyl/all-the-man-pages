NAME
       libinput-measure-touchpad-size - measure the size of a touchpad

SYNOPSIS
       libinput measure touchpad-size [--help] WxH [/dev/input/event0]

DESCRIPTION
       The  libinput measure touchpad-size tool measures the size of a touchpad. This is an interactive tool. When executed, the tool will prompt the user to interact with the touchpad. The tool records
       the axis ranges and calculates the size and resolution based on those. On termination, the tool prints a hwdb entry that can be added to the 60-evdev.hwdb file provided by system.

       For details see the online documentation here: https://wayland.freedesktop.org/libinput/doc/latest/absolute-coordinate-ranges.html

       This is a debugging tool only, its output may change at any time. Do not rely on the output.

       This tool usually needs to be run as root to have access to the /dev/input/eventX nodes.

OPTIONS
       This tool must be provided the physical dimensions of the device in mm.  For example, if your touchpad is 100mm wide and 55mm high, run this tool as libinput measure touchpad-size 100x55

       If a device node is given, this tool opens that device node. Otherwise, this tool searches for the first node that looks like a touchpad and uses that node.
