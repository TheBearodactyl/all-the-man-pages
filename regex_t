NAME
       regex_t, regmatch_t, regoff_t - regular expression matching

LIBRARY
       Standard C library (libc)

SYNOPSIS
       #include <regex.h>

       typedef struct {
           size_t    re_nsub;  /* Number of parenthesized subexpressions */
       } regex_t;

       typedef struct {
           regoff_t  rm_so;    /* Byte offset from start of string
                                  to start of substring */
           regoff_t  rm_eo;    /* Byte offset from start of string to
                                  the first character after the end of
                                  substring */
       } regmatch_t;

       typedef /* ... */  regoff_t;

DESCRIPTION
       regex_t
              This  is  a  structure type used in regular expression matching.
              It holds a  compiled  regular  expression,  compiled  with  reg‚Äê
              comp(3).

       regmatch_t
              This is a structure type used in regular expression matching.

       regoff_t
              It is a signed integer type capable of storing the largest value
              that can be stored in either an  ptrdiff_t  type  or  a  ssize_t
              type.

STANDARDS
       POSIX.1-2008.

HISTORY
       POSIX.1-2001.

       Prior  to  POSIX.1-2008,  the  type  was capable of storing the largest
       value that can be stored in either an off_t type or a ssize_t type.
