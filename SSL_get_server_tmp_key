SSL_GET_PEER_TMP_KEY(3ssl)          OpenSSL         SSL_GET_PEER_TMP_KEY(3ssl)

NAME
       SSL_get_peer_tmp_key, SSL_get_server_tmp_key, SSL_get_tmp_key - get
       information about temporary keys used during a handshake

SYNOPSIS
        #include <openssl/ssl.h>

        long SSL_get_peer_tmp_key(SSL *ssl, EVP_PKEY **key);
        long SSL_get_server_tmp_key(SSL *ssl, EVP_PKEY **key);
        long SSL_get_tmp_key(SSL *ssl, EVP_PKEY **key);

DESCRIPTION
       SSL_get_peer_tmp_key() returns the temporary key provided by the peer
       and used during key exchange. For example, if ECDHE is in use, then
       this represents the peer's public ECDHE key. On success a pointer to
       the key is stored in *key. It is the caller's responsibility to free
       this key after use using EVP_PKEY_free(3).

       SSL_get_server_tmp_key() is a backwards compatibility alias for
       SSL_get_peer_tmp_key().  Under that name it worked just on the client
       side of the connection, its behaviour on the server end is release-
       dependent.

       SSL_get_tmp_key() returns the equivalent information for the local end
       of the connection.

RETURN VALUES
       All these functions return 1 on success and 0 otherwise.

NOTES
       This function is implemented as a macro.
