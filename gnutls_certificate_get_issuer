NAME
       gnutls_certificate_get_issuer - API function

SYNOPSIS
       #include <gnutls/gnutls.h>

       int gnutls_certificate_get_issuer(gnutls_certificate_credentials_t sc, gnutls_x509_crt_t cert, gnutls_x509_crt_t * issuer, unsigned int flags);

ARGUMENTS
       gnutls_certificate_credentials_t sc
                   is a gnutls_certificate_credentials_t type.

       gnutls_x509_crt_t cert
                   is the certificate to find issuer for

       gnutls_x509_crt_t * issuer
                   Will hold the issuer if any. Should be treated as constant.

       unsigned int flags
                   Use zero or GNUTLS_TL_GET_COPY

DESCRIPTION
       This function will return the issuer of a given certificate.  If the flag GNUTLS_TL_GET_COPY is specified a copy of the issuer will be returned which must be freed using gnutls_x509_crt_deinit().
       In that case the provided  issuer must not be initialized.

       As with gnutls_x509_trust_list_get_issuer() this function requires the GNUTLS_TL_GET_COPY flag in order to operate with PKCS11 trust lists in a thread-safe way.

RETURNS
       On success, GNUTLS_E_SUCCESS (0) is returned, otherwise a negative error value.

SINCE
       3.0
