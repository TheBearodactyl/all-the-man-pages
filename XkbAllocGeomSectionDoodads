NAME
       XkbAllocGeomSectionDoodads - Allocate doodads that are specific to a section

SYNOPSIS
       Status XkbAllocGeomSectionDoodads (XkbSectionPtr section, int num_needed);

ARGUMENTS
       section
              section for which doodads should be allocated

       num_needed
              number of new doodads required

DESCRIPTION
       Xkb  provides a number of functions to allocate and free subcomponents of a keyboard geometry. Use these functions to create or modify keyboard geometries.  Note that these functions merely allo‚Äê
       cate space for the new element(s), and it is up to you to fill in the values explicitly in your code. These allocation functions increase sz_* but never touch num_* (unless there is an allocation
       failure,  in which case they reset both sz_* and num_* to zero). These functions return Success if they succeed, BadAlloc if they are not able to allocate space, or BadValue if a parameter is not
       as expected.

       XkbAllocGeomSectionDoodads allocates num_needed doodads and adds them to the specified section.  No initialization of the doodads is done.

       To free geometry doodads, use XkbFreeGeomDoodads.

DIAGNOSTICS
       BadAlloc       Unable to allocate storage

       BadValue       An argument is out of range
