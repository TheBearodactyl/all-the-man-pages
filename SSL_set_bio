SSL_SET_BIO(3ssl)                   OpenSSL                  SSL_SET_BIO(3ssl)

NAME
       SSL_set_bio, SSL_set0_rbio, SSL_set0_wbio - connect the SSL object with
       a BIO

SYNOPSIS
        #include <openssl/ssl.h>

        void SSL_set_bio(SSL *ssl, BIO *rbio, BIO *wbio);
        void SSL_set0_rbio(SSL *s, BIO *rbio);
        void SSL_set0_wbio(SSL *s, BIO *wbio);

DESCRIPTION
       SSL_set0_rbio() connects the BIO rbio for the read operations of the
       ssl object. The SSL engine inherits the behaviour of rbio. If the BIO
       is nonblocking then the ssl object will also have nonblocking
       behaviour. This function transfers ownership of rbio to ssl. It will be
       automatically freed using BIO_free_all(3) when the ssl is freed. On
       calling this function, any existing rbio that was previously set will
       also be freed via a call to BIO_free_all(3) (this includes the case
       where the rbio is set to the same value as previously).

       SSL_set0_wbio() works in the same as SSL_set0_rbio() except that it
       connects the BIO wbio for the write operations of the ssl object. Note
       that if the rbio and wbio are the same then SSL_set0_rbio() and
       SSL_set0_wbio() each take ownership of one reference. Therefore, it may
       be necessary to increment the number of references available using
       BIO_up_ref(3) before calling the set0 functions.

       SSL_set_bio() is similar to SSL_set0_rbio() and SSL_set0_wbio() except
       that it connects both the rbio and the wbio at the same time, and
       transfers the ownership of rbio and wbio to ssl according to the
       following set of rules:

       • If neither the rbio or wbio have changed from their previous values
         then nothing is done.

       • If the rbio and wbio parameters are different and both are different
         to their previously set values then one reference is consumed for the
         rbio and one reference is consumed for the wbio.

       • If the rbio and wbio parameters are the same and the rbio is not the
         same as the previously set value then one reference is consumed.

       • If the rbio and wbio parameters are the same and the rbio is the same
         as the previously set value, then no additional references are
         consumed.

       • If the rbio and wbio parameters are different and the rbio is the
         same as the previously set value then one reference is consumed for
         the wbio and no references are consumed for the rbio.

       • If the rbio and wbio parameters are different and the wbio is the
         same as the previously set value and the old rbio and wbio values
         were the same as each other then one reference is consumed for the
         rbio and no references are consumed for the wbio.

       • If the rbio and wbio parameters are different and the wbio is the
         same as the previously set value and the old rbio and wbio values
         were different to each other, then one reference is consumed for the
         rbio and one reference is consumed for the wbio.

       Because of this complexity, this function should be avoided; use
       SSL_set0_rbio() and SSL_set0_wbio() instead.

RETURN VALUES
       SSL_set_bio(), SSL_set0_rbio() and SSL_set0_wbio() cannot fail.
