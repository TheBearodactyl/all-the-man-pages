NAME
       gnutls_x509_crt_verify - API function

SYNOPSIS
       #include <gnutls/x509.h>

       int gnutls_x509_crt_verify(gnutls_x509_crt_t cert, const gnutls_x509_crt_t * CA_list, unsigned CA_list_length, unsigned int flags, unsigned int * verify);

ARGUMENTS
       gnutls_x509_crt_t cert
                   is the certificate to be verified

       const gnutls_x509_crt_t * CA_list
                   is one certificate that is considered to be trusted one

       unsigned CA_list_length
                   holds the number of CA certificate in CA_list

       unsigned int flags
                   Flags that may be used to change the verification algorithm. Use OR of the gnutls_certificate_verify_flags enumerations.

       unsigned int * verify
                   will hold the certificate verification output.

DESCRIPTION
       This function will try to verify the given certificate and return its status. Note that a verification error does not imply a negative return status. In that case the  verify status is set.

       The details of the verification are the same as in gnutls_x509_trust_list_verify_crt2().

RETURNS
       On success, GNUTLS_E_SUCCESS (0) is returned, otherwise a negative error value.
