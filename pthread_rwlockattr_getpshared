PROLOG
       This  manual  page is part of the POSIX Programmer's Manual.  The Linux
       implementation of this interface may differ (consult the  corresponding
       Linux  manual page for details of Linux behavior), or the interface may
       not be implemented on Linux.

NAME
       pthread_rwlockattr_getpshared, pthread_rwlockattr_setpshared — get  and
       set  the process-shared attribute of the read-write lock attributes ob‐
       ject

SYNOPSIS
       #include <pthread.h>

       int pthread_rwlockattr_getpshared(const pthread_rwlockattr_t
           *restrict attr, int *restrict pshared);
       int pthread_rwlockattr_setpshared(pthread_rwlockattr_t *attr,
           int pshared);

DESCRIPTION
       The pthread_rwlockattr_getpshared() function shall obtain the value  of
       the  process-shared  attribute  from  the initialized attributes object
       referenced by attr.  The pthread_rwlockattr_setpshared() function shall
       set  the  process-shared  attribute in an initialized attributes object
       referenced by attr.

       The process-shared attribute shall be set to PTHREAD_PROCESS_SHARED  to
       permit a read-write lock to be operated upon by any thread that has ac‐
       cess to the memory where the read-write lock is allocated, even if  the
       read-write  lock is allocated in memory that is shared by multiple pro‐
       cesses. See Section 2.9.9, Synchronization Object Copies  and  Alterna‐
       tive  Mappings  for  further  requirements.  The  default  value of the
       process-shared attribute shall be PTHREAD_PROCESS_PRIVATE.

       Additional attributes, their default values, and the names of the asso‐
       ciated  functions to get and set those attribute values are implementa‐
       tion-defined.

       The behavior is undefined if the value specified by the  attr  argument
       to  pthread_rwlockattr_getpshared()  or pthread_rwlockattr_setpshared()
       does not refer to an initialized read-write lock attributes object.

RETURN VALUE
       Upon successful completion, the  pthread_rwlockattr_getpshared()  func‐
       tion shall return zero and store the value of the process-shared attri‐
       bute of attr into the object referenced by the pshared parameter.  Oth‐
       erwise, an error number shall be returned to indicate the error.

       If  successful,  the pthread_rwlockattr_setpshared() function shall re‐
       turn zero; otherwise, an error number shall be returned to indicate the
       error.

ERRORS
       The pthread_rwlockattr_setpshared() function may fail if:

       EINVAL The  new  value specified for the attribute is outside the range
              of legal values for that attribute.

       These functions shall not return an error code of [EINTR].
