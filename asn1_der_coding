NAME
       asn1_der_coding - API function

SYNOPSIS
       #include <libtasn1.h>

       int asn1_der_coding(asn1_node_const element, const char * name, void * ider, int * len, char * ErrorDescription);

ARGUMENTS
       asn1_node_const element
                   pointer to an ASN1 element

       const char * name
                   the name of the structure you want to encode (it must be inside *POINTER).

       void * ider vector that will contain the DER encoding. DER must be a pointer to memory cells already allocated.

       int * len   number of bytes of * ider :  ider [0].. ider [len-1], Initialy holds the sizeof of der vector.

       char * ErrorDescription
                   return the error description or an empty string if success.

DESCRIPTION
       Creates the DER encoding for the NAME structure (inside *POINTER structure).

RETURNS
       ASN1_SUCCESS  if DER encoding OK, ASN1_ELEMENT_NOT_FOUND if  name is not a valid element, ASN1_VALUE_NOT_FOUND if there is an element without a value, ASN1_MEM_ERROR if the  ider vector isn't big
       enough and in this case  len will contain the length needed.
