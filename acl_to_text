NAME
     acl_to_text — convert an ACL to text

LIBRARY
     Linux Access Control Lists library (libacl, -lacl).

SYNOPSIS
     #include <sys/types.h>
     #include <sys/acl.h>

     char *
     acl_to_text(acl_t acl, ssize_t *len_p);

DESCRIPTION
     The acl_to_text() function translates the ACL pointed to by the argument acl into a NULL terminated character string.  If the pointer len_p is not NULL, then the function returns the length of the
     string (not including the NULL terminator) in the location pointed to by len_p.  The format of the text string returned by acl_to_text() is the long text form defined in acl(5).  The ACL referred
     to by acl is not changed.

     This function allocates any memory necessary to contain the string and returns a pointer to the string.  The caller should free any releasable memory, when the new string is no longer required, by
     calling acl_free(3) with the (void*)char returned by acl_to_text() as an argument.

RETURN VALUE
     On success, this function returns a pointer to the long text form of the ACL.  On error, a value of (char *)NULL is returned, and errno is set appropriately.

ERRORS
     If any of the following conditions occur, the acl_to_text() function returns a value of (char *)NULL and sets errno to the corresponding value:

     [EINVAL]           The argument acl is not a valid pointer to an ACL.

                        The ACL referenced by acl contains one or more improperly formed ACL entries, or for some other reason cannot be translated into a text form of an ACL.

     [ENOMEM]           The character string to be returned requires more memory than is allowed by the hardware or system-imposed memory management constraints.

STANDARDS
     IEEE Std 1003.1e draft 17 (“POSIX.1e”, abandoned)
