NAME
       gnutls_x509_crt_get_name_constraints - API function

SYNOPSIS
       #include <gnutls/x509.h>

       int gnutls_x509_crt_get_name_constraints(gnutls_x509_crt_t crt, gnutls_x509_name_constraints_t nc, unsigned int flags, unsigned int * critical);

ARGUMENTS
       gnutls_x509_crt_t crt
                   should contain a gnutls_x509_crt_t type

       gnutls_x509_name_constraints_t nc
                   The nameconstraints intermediate type

       unsigned int flags
                   zero or GNUTLS_EXT_FLAG_APPEND

       unsigned int * critical
                   the extension status

DESCRIPTION
       This  function will return an intermediate type containing the name constraints of the provided CA certificate. That structure can be used in combination with gnutls_x509_name_constraints_check()
       to verify whether a server's name is in accordance with the constraints.

       When the  flags is set to GNUTLS_EXT_FLAG_APPEND, then if the  nc structure is empty this function will behave identically as if the flag was not set.  Otherwise if there are elements in the   nc
       structure then the constraints will be merged with the existing constraints following RFC5280 p6.1.4 (excluded constraints will be appended, permitted will be intersected).

       Note that  nc must be initialized prior to calling this function.

RETURNS
       On success, GNUTLS_E_SUCCESS (0) is returned, GNUTLS_E_REQUESTED_DATA_NOT_AVAILABLE if the extension is not present, otherwise a negative error value.

SINCE
       3.3.0
