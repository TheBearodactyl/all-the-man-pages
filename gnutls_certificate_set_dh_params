NAME
       gnutls_certificate_set_dh_params - API function

SYNOPSIS
       #include <gnutls/gnutls.h>

       void gnutls_certificate_set_dh_params(gnutls_certificate_credentials_t res, gnutls_dh_params_t dh_params);

ARGUMENTS
       gnutls_certificate_credentials_t res
                   is a gnutls_certificate_credentials_t type

       gnutls_dh_params_t dh_params
                   the Diffie-Hellman parameters.

DESCRIPTION
       This function will set the Diffie-Hellman parameters for a certificate server to use. These parameters will be used in Ephemeral Diffie-Hellman cipher suites.  Note that only a pointer to the pa‐
       rameters are stored in the certificate handle, so you must not deallocate the parameters before the certificate is deallocated.

DEPRECATED
       This function is unnecessary and discouraged on GnuTLS 3.6.0 or later. Since 3.6.0, DH parameters are negotiated following RFC7919.
