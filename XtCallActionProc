NAME
       XtCallActionProc - invoke an action procedure directly

SYNTAX
       #include <X11/Intrinsic.h>

       void XtCallActionProc(Widget widget, const char *action, XEvent *event, String *params, Cardinal num_params);

ARGUMENTS
       widget    Specifies the widget in which the action is to be invoked.  Must be of class core of any subclass thereof.

       action    Specifies the name of the action routine.

       event     Specifies the contents of the event passed to the action routine.

       params    Specifies the contents of the params passed to the action routine.

       num_params
                 Specifies the num of entries in params.

DESCRIPTION
       XtCallActionProc searches for the named action routine in the same manner and order as translation tables are bound.  If found, the action routine is invoked with the specified widget, event
       pointer, and parameters.  It is the responsibility of the caller to ensure that the contents of event, params, and num_params arguments are appropriate for the specified routine, and if neces‚Äê
       sary, that the specified widget is realized or sensitive.  If the named action routine cannot be found, XtCallActionProc generates a warning message and returns.
