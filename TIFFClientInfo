NAME
       TIFFClientInfo - provides a method to hand over user defined data from one routine to another

SYNOPSIS
          #include <tiffio.h>

       void *TIFFGetClientInfo(TIFF *tif, const char *name)

       void TIFFSetClientInfo(TIFF *tif, void *data, const char *name)

DESCRIPTION
       The clientinfo linked list provides a method to hand over user defined data from one routine to another via the internal tif storage of the libtiff library.

       TIFFGetClientInfo() returns a pointer to the data of the named entry in the clientinfo-list. If the name is not found NULL is returned.

       TIFFSetClientInfo() adds or replaces an entry in the clientinfo-list with the name and the pointer to the data provided by the caller.

DIAGNOSTICS
       None.
