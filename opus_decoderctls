NAME
       opus_decoderctls - Decoder related CTLs

SYNOPSIS
   Macros
       #define OPUS_SET_GAIN(x)
           Configures decoder gain adjustment.
       #define OPUS_GET_GAIN(x)
           Gets the decoder's configured gain adjustment.
       #define OPUS_GET_LAST_PACKET_DURATION(x)
           Gets the duration (in samples) of the last packet successfully
           decoded or concealed.
       #define OPUS_GET_PITCH(x)
           Gets the pitch of the last decoded frame, if available.

Macro Definition Documentation
   #define OPUS_GET_GAIN(x)
       Gets the decoder's configured gain adjustment.

       See also
           OPUS_SET_GAIN

       Parameters
           x opus_int32 *: Amount to scale PCM signal by in Q8 dB units.

   #define OPUS_GET_LAST_PACKET_DURATION(x)
       Gets the duration (in samples) of the last packet successfully decoded
       or concealed.

       Parameters
           x opus_int32 *: Number of samples (at current sampling rate).

   #define OPUS_GET_PITCH(x)
       Gets the pitch of the last decoded frame, if available. This can be
       used for any post-processing algorithm requiring the use of pitch, e.g.
       time stretching/shortening. If the last frame was not voiced, or if the
       pitch was not coded in the frame, then zero is returned.

       This CTL is only implemented for decoder instances.

       Parameters
           x opus_int32 *: pitch period at 48 kHz (or 0 if not available)

   #define OPUS_SET_GAIN(x)
       Configures decoder gain adjustment. Scales the decoded output by a
       factor specified in Q8 dB units. This has a maximum range of -32768 to
       32767 inclusive, and returns OPUS_BAD_ARG otherwise. The default is
       zero indicating no adjustment. This setting survives decoder reset.

       gain = pow(10, x/(20.0*256))

       Parameters
           x opus_int32: Amount to scale PCM signal by in Q8 dB units.
