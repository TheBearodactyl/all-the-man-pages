NAME
       gnutls_handshake_set_max_packet_length - API function

SYNOPSIS
       #include <gnutls/gnutls.h>

       void gnutls_handshake_set_max_packet_length(gnutls_session_t session, size_t max);

ARGUMENTS
       gnutls_session_t session
                   is a gnutls_session_t type.

       size_t max  is the maximum number.

DESCRIPTION
       This function will set the maximum size of all handshake messages.  Handshakes over this size are rejected with GNUTLS_E_HANDSHAKE_TOO_LARGE error code.  The default value is 128kb which is typi‐
       cally large enough.  Set this to 0 if you do not want to set an upper limit.

       The reason for restricting the handshake message sizes are to limit Denial of Service attacks.

       Note that the maximum handshake size was increased to 128kb from 48kb in GnuTLS 3.5.5.
