NAME
       ares_version - Get the version number of the library

SYNOPSIS
       #include <ares.h>

       const char *ares_version(int *version)

DESCRIPTION
       The ares_version(3) function gets the library version as a string and optionally as an integer stored in the version argument. If you pass a NULL, no integer is attempted to be returned.

       The  integer  is built up as 24bit number, with 8 separate bits used for major number, minor number and patch number. This makes a version string such as 1.2.3 will be returned as the hexadecimal
       number 0x010203 (decimal 66051).
