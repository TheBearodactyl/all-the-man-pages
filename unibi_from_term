NAME
       unibi_from_term - read a terminfo entry for a named terminal

SYNOPSIS
        #include <unibilium.h>

        unibi_term *unibi_from_term(const char *name);

DESCRIPTION
       This function locates the terminfo file for name, then calls "unibi_from_file".

       It looks in the following places:

       1.  If the environment variable "TERMINFO" is set, it is interpreted as the name of the directory to search for local terminal definitions before checking in the standard place.

       2.  Otherwise, "$HOME/.terminfo" is tried.

       3.  If that was not successful and "TERMINFO_DIRS" is set, it is interpreted as a colon-separated list of directories to search.

       4.  If "TERMINFO_DIRS" is not set, a compiled-in fallback ("unibi_terminfo_dirs") is used instead.

RETURN VALUE
       See unibi_from_file(3).
