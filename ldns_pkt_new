NAME
       ldns_pkt_new, ldns_pkt_free, ldns_pkt_print, ldns_pkt_query_new, ldns_pkt_query_new_frm_str, ldns_pkt_reply_type - ldns_pkt creation, destruction and printing

SYNOPSIS
       #include <stdint.h>
       #include <stdbool.h>

       #include <ldns/ldns.h>

       ldns_pkt* ldns_pkt_new(void);

       void ldns_pkt_free(ldns_pkt *packet);

       void ldns_pkt_print(FILE *output, const ldns_pkt *pkt);

       ldns_pkt* ldns_pkt_query_new(ldns_rdf *rr_name, ldns_rr_type rr_type, ldns_rr_class rr_class, uint16_t flags);

       ldns_status ldns_pkt_query_new_frm_str(ldns_pkt **p, const char *rr_name, ldns_rr_type rr_type, ldns_rr_class rr_class , uint16_t flags);

       ldns_pkt_type ldns_pkt_reply_type(const ldns_pkt *p);

DESCRIPTION
       ldns_pkt_new() allocates and initializes a ldns_pkt structure.
              Returns pointer to the new packet

       ldns_pkt_free() frees the packet structure and all data that it contains.
              packet: The packet structure to free
              Returns void

       ldns_pkt_print() Prints the data in the DNS packet to the given file stream (in presentation format)

              output: the file stream to print to
              pkt: the packet to print
              Returns void

       ldns_pkt_query_new() creates a packet with a query in it for the given name, type and class.
              rr_name: the name to query for (not copied).  The returned packet will take ownership of rr_name, so the caller should not free it.
              rr_type: the type to query for
              rr_class: the class to query for
              flags: packet flags
              Returns ldns_pkt* a pointer to the new pkt

       ldns_pkt_query_new_frm_str() creates a query packet for the given name, type, class.
              p: the packet to be returned
              rr_name: the name to query for (as string)
              rr_type: the type to query for
              rr_class: the class to query for
              flags: packet flags
              Returns LDNS_STATUS_OK or a ldns_status mesg with the error

       ldns_pkt_reply_type() looks inside the packet to determine what kind of packet it is, AUTH, NXDOMAIN, REFERRAL, etc.
              p: the packet to examine
              Returns the type of packet
