NAME
       DSA_dup_DH - create a DH structure out of DSA structure

SYNOPSIS
        #include <openssl/dsa.h>

       The following functions have been deprecated since OpenSSL 3.0, and can be hidden entirely by defining OPENSSL_API_COMPAT with a suitable version value, see openssl_user_macros(7):

        DH *DSA_dup_DH(const DSA *r);

DESCRIPTION
       The function described on this page is deprecated. There is no direct replacement, applications should use the EVP_PKEY APIs for Diffie-Hellman operations.

       DSA_dup_DH() duplicates DSA parameters/keys as DH parameters/keys. q is lost during that conversion, but the resulting DH parameters contain its length.

RETURN VALUES
       DSA_dup_DH() returns the new DH structure, and NULL on error. The error codes can be obtained by ERR_get_error(3).

NOTE
       Be careful to avoid small subgroup attacks when using this.

SEE ALSO
       DH_new(3), DSA_new(3), ERR_get_error(3)

HISTORY
       This function was deprecated in OpenSSL 3.0.
