NAME
       adig - print information collected from Domain Name System (DNS) servers

SYNOPSIS
       adig [OPTION]... NAME...

DESCRIPTION
       Send queries to DNS servers about NAME and print received information, where NAME is a valid DNS name (e.g. www.example.com, 1.2.3.10.in-addr.arpa).

       This utility comes with the c-ares asynchronous resolver library.

OPTIONS
       -c class
              Set the query class.  Possible values for class are ANY, CHAOS, HS and IN (default).

       -d     Print some extra debugging output.

       -f flag
              Add a behavior control flag.  Possible values for flag are
               igntc - ignore to query in TCP to get truncated UDP answer,
               noaliases - don't honor the HOSTALIASES environment variable,
               norecurse - don't query upstream servers recursively,
               primary - use the first server,
               stayopen - don't close the communication sockets, and
               usevc - always use TCP.

       -h, -? Display this help and exit.

       -s server
              Connect to specified DNS server, instead of the system's default one(s).  Servers are tried in round-robin, if the previous one failed.

       -t type
              Query  records of specified type.  Possible values for type are A (default), AAAA, AFSDB, ANY, AXFR, CNAME, GPOS, HINFO, ISDN, KEY, LOC, MAILA, MAILB, MB, MD, MF, MG, MINFO, MR, MX, NAPTR,
              NS, NSAP, NSAP_PTR, NULL, PTR, PX, RP, RT, SIG, SOA, SRV, TXT, URI, WKS and X25.

       -T port
              Connect to the specified TCP port of DNS server.

       -U port
              Connect to the specified UDP port of DNS server.

       -x     For an IPv4 -t PTR a.b.c.d lookup, query for
              d.c.b.a.in-addr.arpa.  This more often gives correct names in the ANSWER.
              For an IPv6 -t PTR addr lookup, query for a.b.c....z.IP6.ARPA.

       -xx    As for -x and an IPv6 address, compact a.b.c....z.IP6.ARPA. into a RFC-2673 bit-string.  This compacted bit-string form is not supported by many DNS-servers.
