DCB-APPTRUST(8)                                                                                    Linux                                                                                   DCB-APPTRUST(8)

NAME
       dcb-apptrust - show / configure per-selector trust and trust order of the application priority table of the DCB (Data Center Bridging) subsystem.

SYNOPSIS
       dcb [ OPTIONS ] apptrust { COMMAND | help }

       dcb apptrust show dev DEV [ order ]

       dcb apptrust set dev DEV [ order SEL-LIST ]

       SEL-LIST := [ SEL-LIST ] SEL

       SEL := { ethtype | stream-port | dgram-port | port | dscp | pcp }

DESCRIPTION
       dcb apptrust is used to configure per-selector trust and trust order of the Application Priority Table, see dcb-app(8) for details on how to configure app table entries.

       Selector trust can be used by the software stack, or drivers (most likely the latter), when querying the APP table, to determine if an APP entry should take effect, or not. Additionaly, the order
       of the trusted selectors will dictate which selector should take precedence, in the case of multiple different APP table selectors being present.

COMMANDS
       show   Display all trusted selectors.

       set    Set new list of trusted selectors. Empty list is effectively the same as removing trust entirely.

PARAMETERS
       The following describes only the write direction, i.e. as used with the set command. For the show command, the parameter name is to be used as a simple keyword without further arguments. This in‚Äê
       structs the tool to show the values of a given parameter.

       order SEL-LIST
              SEL-LIST is a space-separated list of selector names. Possible selector values are: ethtype, stream-port, dgram-port, port, dscp, and pcp

EXAMPLE & USAGE
       Set trust order to: dscp, pcp for eth0:

       # dcb apptrust set dev eth0 order dscp pcp

       Set trust order to: port (stream or dgram), pcp, ethtype for eth1:

       # dcb apptrust set dev eth1 order port pcp ethtype

       Show what was set:

       # dcb apptrust show dev eth0
       order: port pcp ethtype

EXIT STATUS
       Exit status is 0 if command was successful or a positive integer upon failure.
