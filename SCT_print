SCT_PRINT(3ssl)                     OpenSSL                    SCT_PRINT(3ssl)

NAME
       SCT_print, SCT_LIST_print, SCT_validation_status_string - Prints Signed
       Certificate Timestamps in a human-readable way

SYNOPSIS
        #include <openssl/ct.h>

        void SCT_print(const SCT *sct, BIO *out, int indent, const CTLOG_STORE *logs);
        void SCT_LIST_print(const STACK_OF(SCT) *sct_list, BIO *out, int indent,
                            const char *separator, const CTLOG_STORE *logs);
        const char *SCT_validation_status_string(const SCT *sct);

DESCRIPTION
       SCT_print() prints a single Signed Certificate Timestamp (SCT) to a BIO
       in a human-readable format. SCT_LIST_print() prints an entire list of
       SCTs in a similar way. A separator can be specified to delimit each SCT
       in the output.

       The output can be indented by a specified number of spaces. If a
       CTLOG_STORE is provided, it will be used to print the description of
       the CT log that issued each SCT (if that log is in the CTLOG_STORE).
       Alternatively, NULL can be passed as the CTLOG_STORE parameter to
       disable this feature.

       SCT_validation_status_string() will return the validation status of an
       SCT as a human-readable string. Call SCT_validate() or
       SCT_LIST_validate() beforehand in order to set the validation status of
       an SCT first.

RETURN VALUES
       SCT_validation_status_string() returns a NUL-terminated string
       representing the validation status of an SCT object.
