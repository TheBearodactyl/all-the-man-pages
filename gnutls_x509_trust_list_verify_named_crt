NAME
       gnutls_x509_trust_list_verify_named_crt - API function

SYNOPSIS
       #include <gnutls/x509.h>

       int  gnutls_x509_trust_list_verify_named_crt(gnutls_x509_trust_list_t  list,  gnutls_x509_crt_t  cert, const void * name, size_t name_size, unsigned int flags, unsigned int * voutput, gnutls_ver‐
       ify_output_function func);

ARGUMENTS
       gnutls_x509_trust_list_t list
                   The list

       gnutls_x509_crt_t cert
                   is the certificate to be verified

       const void * name
                   is the certificate's name

       size_t name_size
                   is the certificate's name size

       unsigned int flags
                   Flags that may be used to change the verification algorithm. Use OR of the gnutls_certificate_verify_flags enumerations.

       unsigned int * voutput
                   will hold the certificate verification output.

       gnutls_verify_output_function func
                   If non-null will be called on each chain element verification with the output.

DESCRIPTION
       This function will try to find a certificate that is associated with the provided name --see gnutls_x509_trust_list_add_named_crt(). If a match is found the certificate is  considered  valid.  In
       addition to that this function will also check CRLs. The  voutput parameter will hold an OR'ed sequence of gnutls_certificate_status_t flags.

       Additionally  a certificate verification profile can be specified from the ones in gnutls_certificate_verification_profiles_t by ORing the result of GNUTLS_PROFILE_TO_VFLAGS() to the verification
       flags.

RETURNS
       On success, GNUTLS_E_SUCCESS (0) is returned, otherwise a negative error value.

SINCE
       3.0.0
