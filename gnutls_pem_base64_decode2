NAME
       gnutls_pem_base64_decode2 - API function

SYNOPSIS
       #include <gnutls/gnutls.h>

       int gnutls_pem_base64_decode2(const char * header, const gnutls_datum_t * b64_data, gnutls_datum_t * result);

ARGUMENTS
       const char * header
                   The PEM header (eg. CERTIFICATE)

       const gnutls_datum_t * b64_data
                   contains the encoded data

       gnutls_datum_t * result
                   the location of decoded data

DESCRIPTION
       This  function  will  decode the given encoded data. The decoded data will be allocated, and stored into result.  If the header given is non null this function will search for "-----BEGIN header"
       and decode only this part. Otherwise it will decode the first PEM packet found.

       You should use gnutls_free() to free the returned data.

       Note, that prior to GnuTLS 3.4.0 this function was available under the name gnutls_pem_base64_decode_alloc(). There is compatibility macro pointing to this function.

RETURNS
       On success, GNUTLS_E_SUCCESS (0) is returned, otherwise an error code is returned.

SINCE
       3.4.0
