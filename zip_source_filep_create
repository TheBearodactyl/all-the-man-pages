ZIP_SOURCE_FILEP(3)                                                                    BSD Library Functions Manual                                                                    ZIP_SOURCE_FILEP(3)

NAME
     zip_source_filep, zip_source_filep_create â€” create data source from FILE *

LIBRARY
     libzip (-lzip)

SYNOPSIS
     #include <zip.h>

     zip_source_t *
     zip_source_filep(zip_t *archive, FILE *file, zip_uint64_t start, zip_int64_t len);

     zip_source_t *
     zip_source_filep_create(FILE *file, zip_uint64_t start, zip_int64_t len, zip_error_t *error);

DESCRIPTION
     The functions zip_source_filep() and zip_source_filep_create() create a zip source from a file stream.  They read len bytes from offset start from the open file stream file.  If len is 0 or -1, the
     whole file (starting from start) is used.

     If the file stream supports seeking, the source can be used to open a read-only zip archive from.

     The file stream is closed when the source is being freed, usually by zip_close(3).

RETURN VALUES
     Upon successful completion, the created source is returned.  Otherwise, NULL is returned and the error code in archive or error is set to indicate the error.

ERRORS
     zip_source_filep() fails if:

     [ZIP_ER_INVAL]     file, start, or len are invalid.

     [ZIP_ER_MEMORY]    Required memory could not be allocated.

SEE ALSO
     libzip(3), zip_file_add(3), zip_file_replace(3), zip_source(3)

HISTORY
     zip_source_filep() and zip_source_filep_create() were added in libzip 1.0.
