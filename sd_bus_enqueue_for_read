NAME
       sd_bus_enqueue_for_read - Re-enqueue a bus message on a bus connection,
       for reading

SYNOPSIS
       #include <systemd/sd-bus.h>

       int sd_bus_enqueue_for_read(sd_bus *bus, sd_bus_message *message);

DESCRIPTION
       sd_bus_enqueue_for_read() may be used to re-enqueue an incoming bus
       message on the local read queue, so that it is processed and dispatched
       locally again, similarly to how an incoming message from the peer is
       processed. Takes a bus connection object and the message to enqueue. A
       reference is taken of the message and the caller's reference thus
       remains in possession of the caller. The message is enqueued at the end
       of the queue, thus will be dispatched after all other already queued
       messages are dispatched.

       This call is primarily useful for dealing with incoming method calls
       that may be processed only after an additional asynchronous operation
       completes. One example are PolicyKit authorization requests that are
       determined to be necessary to authorize a newly incoming method call:
       when the PolicyKit response is received the original method call may be
       re-enqueued to process it again, this time with the authorization
       result known.

RETURN VALUE
       On success, this function return 0 or a positive integer. On failure,
       it returns a negative errno-style error code.

   Errors
       Returned errors may indicate the following problems:

       -ECHILD
           The bus connection has been created in a different process.

NOTES
       These APIs are implemented as a shared library, which can be compiled
       and linked to with the libsystemd pkg-config(1) file.
