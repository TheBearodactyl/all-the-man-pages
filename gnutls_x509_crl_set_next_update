NAME
       gnutls_x509_crl_set_next_update - API function

SYNOPSIS
       #include <gnutls/x509.h>

       int gnutls_x509_crl_set_next_update(gnutls_x509_crl_t crl, time_t exp_time);

ARGUMENTS
       gnutls_x509_crl_t crl
                   should contain a gnutls_x509_crl_t type

       time_t exp_time
                   The actual time

DESCRIPTION
       This function will set the time this CRL will be updated.  This is an optional value to be set on a CRL and this call can be omitted when generating a CRL.

       Prior to GnuTLS 3.5.7, setting a nextUpdate field was required in order to generate a CRL.

RETURNS
       On success, GNUTLS_E_SUCCESS (0) is returned, otherwise a negative error value.
