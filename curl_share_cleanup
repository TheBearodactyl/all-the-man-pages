NAME
       curl_share_cleanup - Clean up a shared object

SYNOPSIS
       #include <curl/curl.h>

       CURLSHcode curl_share_cleanup(CURLSH *share_handle);

DESCRIPTION
       This function deletes a shared object. The share handle cannot be used anymore when this function has been called.

       Passing in a NULL pointer in share_handle will make this function return immediately with no action.

EXAMPLE
         CURLSHcode sh;
         share = curl_share_init();
         sh = curl_share_setopt(share, CURLSHOPT_SHARE, CURL_LOCK_DATA_CONNECT);
         /* use the share, then ... */
         curl_share_cleanup(share);

AVAILABILITY
       Added in 7.10

RETURN VALUE
       CURLSHE_OK  (zero)  means that the option was set properly, non-zero means an error occurred as <curl/curl.h> defines. See the libcurl-errors.3 man page for the full list with descriptions. If an
       error occurs, then the share object will not be deleted.
