NAME
       XkbSelectEvents -  Selects and / or deselects for delivery of one or more Xkb events and has them delivered under all conditions

SYNOPSIS
       Bool XkbSelectEvents (Display *display, unsigned int device_spec, unsigned long int bits_to_change, unsigned long int values_for_bits);

ARGUMENTS
       display
              connection to the X server

       device_spec
              device ID, or XkbUseCoreKbd

       bits_to_change
              determines events to be selected / deselected

       values_for_bits
              1=>select, 0->deselect; for events in bits_to_change

DESCRIPTION
       Xkb  events  are selected using an event mask, much the same as normal core X events are selected. However, unlike selecting core X events, where you must specify the selection status (on or off)
       for all possible event types whenever you wish to change the selection criteria for any one event, Xkb allows you to restrict the specification to only the event types you wish  to  change.  This
       means that you do not need to remember the event selection values for all possible types each time you want to change one of them.

       Many  Xkb  event  types  are generated under several different circumstances. When selecting to receive an Xkb event, you may specify either that you want it delivered under all circumstances, or
       that you want it delivered only for a subset of the possible circumstances.

       You can also deselect an event type that was previously selected for, using the same granularity.

       Xkb provides two functions to select and deselect delivery of Xkb events.  XkbSelectEvents allows you to select or deselect delivery of more than one Xkb event type at once. Events selected using
       XkbSelectEvents  are  delivered to your program under all circumstances that generate the events.  To restrict delivery of an event to a subset of the conditions under which it occurs, use XkbSe‐
       lectEventDetails. XkbSelectEventDetails only allows you to change the selection conditions for a single event at a time, but it provides a means of fine-tuning  the  conditions  under  which  the
       event is delivered.

       This request changes the Xkb event selection mask for the keyboard specified by device_spec.

       Each  Xkb event that can be selected is represented by a bit in the bits_to_change and values_for_bits masks. Only the event selection bits specified by the bits_to_change parameter are affected;
       any unspecified bits are left unchanged. To turn on event selection for an event, set the bit for the event in the bits_to_change parameter and set the corresponding bit  in  the  values_for_bits
       parameter.  To  turn  off  event selection for an event, set the bit for the event in the bits_to_change parameter and do not set the corresponding bit in the values_for_bits parameter. The valid
       values for both of these parameters are an inclusive bitwise OR of the masks shown in Table 1. There is no interface to return your client's current event selection mask. Clients cannot set other
       clients' event selection masks.

       The X server reports the events defined by Xkb to your client application only if you have requested them via a call to XkbSelectEvents or XkbSelectEventDetails.  Specify the event types in which
       you are interested in a mask.

       Table 1 lists the event mask constants that can be specified with the XkbSelectEvents request and the circumstances in which the mask should be specified.

       ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
       Event Mask                     Value      Notification Wanted
       ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
       XkbNewKeyboardNotifyMask       (1L<<0)    Keyboard geometry change
       XkbMapNotifyMask               (1L<<1)    Keyboard mapping change
       XkbStateNotifyMask             (1L<<2)    Keyboard state change
       XkbControlsNotifyMask          (1L<<3)    Keyboard control change
       XkbIndicatorStateNotifyMask    (1L<<4)    Keyboard indicator state change
       XkbIndicatorMapNotifyMask      (1L<<5)    Keyboard indicator map change
       XkbNamesNotifyMask             (1L<<6)    Keyboard name change
       XkbCompatMapNotifyMask         (1L<<7)    Keyboard compat map change
       XkbBellNotifyMask              (1L<<8)    Bell

       XkbActionMessageMask           (1L<<9)    Action message
       XkbAccessXNotifyMask           (1L<<10)   AccessX features
       XkbExtensionDeviceNotifyMask   (1L<<11)   Extension device
       XkbAllEventsMask               (0xFFF)    All Xkb events

       If a bit is not set in the bits_to_change parameter, but the corresponding bit is set in the values_for_bits parameter, a BadMatch protocol error results. If an undefined bit is set in either the
       bits_to_change or the values_for_bits parameter, a BadValue protocol error results.

       All event selection bits are initially zero for clients using the Xkb extension.  Once you set some bits, they remain set for your client until you clear them via another call to XkbSelectEvents.

       XkbSelectEvents returns False if the Xkb extension has not been initialized and True otherwise.

RETURN VALUES
       True           The XkbSelectEvents function returns True if the Xkb extension has been initialized.

       False          The XkbSelectEvents function returns False if the Xkb extension has not been initialized.
