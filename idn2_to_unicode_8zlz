NAME
       idn2_to_unicode_8zlz - API function

SYNOPSIS
       #include <idn2.h>

       int idn2_to_unicode_8zlz(const char * input, char ** output, int flags);

ARGUMENTS
       const char * input
                   Input zero-terminated UTF-8 string.

       char ** output
                   Newly allocated output string in current locale's character set.

       int flags   Currently unused.

DESCRIPTION
       Converts  a possibly ACE encoded domain name in UTF-8 format into a string encoded in the current locale's character set (punycode decoding). The output buffer will be zero-terminated and must be
       deallocated by the caller.

        output may be NULL to test lookup of  input without allocating memory.

SINCE
       2.0.0
