NAME
       ares_parse_ns_reply - Parse a reply to a DNS query of type NS into a hostent

SYNOPSIS
       #include <ares.h>

       int ares_parse_ns_reply(const unsigned char *abuf, int alen,
                               struct hostent **host);

DESCRIPTION
       The  ares_parse_ns_reply  function parses the response to a query of type NS into a struct hostent.  The parameters abuf and alen give the contents of the response.  The result is stored in allo‚Äê
       cated memory and a pointer to it stored into the variable pointed to by host.  The nameservers are stored into the aliases field of the host structure.  It is the caller's responsibility to  free
       the resulting host structure using ares_free_hostent(3) when it is no longer needed.

RETURN VALUES
       ares_parse_ns_reply can return any of the following values:

       ARES_SUCCESS   The response was successfully parsed.

       ARES_EBADRESP  The response was malformatted.

       ARES_ENODATA   The response did not contain an answer to the query.

       ARES_ENOMEM    Memory was exhausted.
