NAME
       gnutls_pkcs11_token_get_info - API function

SYNOPSIS
       #include <gnutls/pkcs11.h>

       int gnutls_pkcs11_token_get_info(const char * url, gnutls_pkcs11_token_info_t ttype, void * output, size_t * output_size);

ARGUMENTS
       const char * url
                   should contain a PKCS 11 URL

       gnutls_pkcs11_token_info_t ttype
                   Denotes the type of information requested

       void * output
                   where output will be stored

       size_t * output_size
                   contains the maximum size of the output buffer and will be overwritten with the actual size.

DESCRIPTION
       This function will return information about the PKCS 11 token such as the label, id, etc.

       When  output is text, a null terminated string is written to  output and its string length is written to  output_size (without null terminator). If the buffer is too small,  output_size will con‐
       tain the expected buffer size (with null terminator for text) and return GNUTLS_E_SHORT_MEMORY_BUFFER.

RETURNS
       GNUTLS_E_SUCCESS (0) on success or a negative error code on error.

SINCE
       2.12.0
