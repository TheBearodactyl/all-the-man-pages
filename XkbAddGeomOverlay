NAME
       XkbAddGeomOverlay - Add one overlay to a section

SYNOPSIS
       XkbOverlayPtr XkbAddGeomOverlay (XkbSectionPtr section, Atom name, int sz_rows);

ARGUMENTS
       section
              section to which an overlay will be added

       name   name of the overlay

       sz_rows
              number of rows to reserve in the overlay

DESCRIPTION
       Xkb  provides  functions  to add a single new element to the top-level keyboard geometry. In each case the num_ * fields of the corresponding structure is incremented by 1. These functions do not
       change sz_* unless there is no more room in the array. Some of these functions fill in the values of the element's structure from the arguments. For other functions,  you  must  explicitly  write
       code to fill the structure's elements.

       The top-level geometry description includes a list of geometry properties.  A geometry property associates an arbitrary string with an equally arbitrary name. Programs that display images of key‐
       boards can use geometry properties as hints, but they are not interpreted by Xkb. No other geometry structures refer to geometry properties.

       XkbAddGeomOverlay adds an overlay with the specified name to the specified section.  The new overlay is created with space allocated for sz_rows rows. If an overlay with name name already  exists
       in  the section, a pointer to the existing overlay is returned.  XkbAddGeomOverlay returns NULL if any of the parameters is empty or if it was not able to allocate space for the overlay. To allo‐
       cate space for an arbitrary number of overlays to a section, use the XkbAllocGeomOverlay function.

STRUCTURES
           typedef struct _XkbOverlayRec {
               Atom                  name;            /* overlay name */
               XkbSectionPtr         section_under;   /* the section under this overlay */
               unsigned short        num_rows;        /* number of rows in the rows array */
               unsigned short        sz_rows;         /* size of the rows array */
               XkbOverlayRowPtr      rows;            /* array of rows in the overlay */
               XkbBoundsPtr          bounds;          /* bounding box for the overlay */
           } XkbOverlayRec,*XkbOverlayPtr;
