SXHKD(1)                         Sxhkd Manual                         SXHKD(1)

NAME
       sxhkd - Simple X hotkey daemon

SYNOPSIS
       sxhkd [OPTIONS] [EXTRA_CONFIG ...]

DESCRIPTION
       sxhkd is a simple X hotkey daemon with a powerful and compact
       configuration syntax.

OPTIONS
       -h
           Print the synopsis to standard output and exit.

       -v
           Print the version information to standard output and exit.

       -m COUNT
           Handle the first COUNT mapping notify events.

       -t TIMEOUT
           Timeout in seconds for the recording of chord chains.

       -c CONFIG_FILE
           Read the main configuration from the given file.

       -r REDIR_FILE
           Redirect the commands output to the given file.

       -s STATUS_FIFO
           Output status information to the given FIFO.

       -a ABORT_KEYSYM
           Name of the keysym used for aborting chord chains.

BEHAVIOR
       sxhkd is a daemon that listens to keyboard events and execute commands.

       It reads its configuration file from $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/sxhkd/sxhkdrc by
       default, or from the given file if the -c option is used.

       Additional configuration files can be passed as arguments.

       If sxhkd receives a SIGUSR1 (resp. SIGUSR2) signal, it will reload its
       configuration file (resp. toggle the grabbing state of all its
       bindings).

       The commands are executed via SHELL -c COMMAND (hence you can use
       environment variables).

       SHELL will be the content of the first defined environment variable in
       the following list: SXHKD_SHELL, SHELL.

       If you have a non-QWERTY keyboard or a non-standard layout
       configuration, you should provide a COUNT of 1 to the -m option or -1
       (interpreted as infinity) if you constantly switch from one layout to
       the other (sxhkd ignores all mapping notify events by default because
       the majority of those events are pointless).

CONFIGURATION
       Each line of the configuration file is interpreted as so:

       •   If it is empty or starts with #, it is ignored.

       •   If it starts with a space, it is read as a command.

       •   Otherwise, it is read as a hotkey.

       General syntax:

           HOTKEY
               [;]COMMAND

           HOTKEY      := CHORD_1 ; CHORD_2 ; ... ; CHORD_n
           CHORD_i     := [MODIFIERS_i +] [~][@]KEYSYM_i
           MODIFIERS_i := MODIFIER_i1 + MODIFIER_i2 + ... + MODIFIER_ik

       The valid modifier names are: super, hyper, meta, alt, control, ctrl,
       shift, mode_switch, lock, mod1, mod2, mod3, mod4, mod5 and any.

       The keysym names are given by the output of xev -event keyboard.

       Hotkeys and commands can be spread across multiple lines by ending each
       partial line with a backslash character.

       When multiple chords are separated by semicolons, the hotkey is a chord
       chain: the command will only be executed after receiving each chord of
       the chain in consecutive order.

       The colon character can be used instead of the semicolon to indicate
       that the chord chain shall not be aborted when the chain tail is
       reached.

       If a command starts with a semicolon, it will be executed
       synchronously, otherwise asynchronously.

       The Escape key can be used to abort a chord chain.

       If @ is added at the beginning of the keysym, the command will be run
       on key release events, otherwise on key press events.

       If ~ is added at the beginning of the keysym, the captured event will
       be replayed for the other clients.

       Pointer hotkeys can be defined by using one of the following special
       keysym names: button1, button2, button3, ..., button24.

       The hotkey and the command may contain sequences of the form
       {STRING_1,...,STRING_N}.

       In addition, the sequences can contain ranges of the form A-Z where A
       and Z are alphanumeric characters.

       The underscore character represents an empty sequence element.
