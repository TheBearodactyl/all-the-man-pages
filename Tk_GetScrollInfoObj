NAME
       Tk_GetScrollInfoObj, Tk_GetScrollInfo - parse arguments for scrolling commands

SYNOPSIS
       #include <tk.h>

       int
       Tk_GetScrollInfoObj(interp, objc, objv, fractionPtr, stepsPtr)

       int
       Tk_GetScrollInfo(interp, argc, argv, fractionPtr, stepsPtr)

ARGUMENTS
       Tcl_Interp *interp (in)               Interpreter to use for error reporting.

       int objc (in)                         Number of Tcl_Obj's in objv array.

       Tcl_Obj *const * objv (in)            Argument  objects.  These represent the entire widget command, of which the first word is typically the widget name and the second word is typically xview or
                                             yview.

       int argc (in)                         Number of strings in argv array.

       const char ** argv (in)               Argument strings.  These represent the entire widget command, of which the first word is typically the widget name and the second word is typically xview  or
                                             yview.

       double *fractionPtr (out)             Filled in with fraction from moveto option, if any.

       int *stepsPtr (out)                   Filled in with line or page count from scroll option, if any.  The value may be negative.

DESCRIPTION
       Tk_GetScrollInfoObj  parses  the  arguments expected by widget scrolling commands such as xview and yview.  It receives the entire list of words that make up a widget command and parses the words
       starting with objv[2].  The words starting with objv[2] must have one of the following forms:
              moveto fraction
              scroll number units
              scroll number pages

       Any of the moveto, scroll, units, and pages keywords may be abbreviated.  If objv has the moveto form, TK_SCROLL_MOVETO is returned as result and *fractionPtr is filled in with the fraction argu‚Äê
       ment  to  the command, which must be a proper real value.  If objv has the scroll form, TK_SCROLL_UNITS or TK_SCROLL_PAGES is returned and *stepsPtr is filled in with the number value, which must
       be a proper integer.  If an error occurs in parsing the arguments, TK_SCROLL_ERROR is returned and an error message is left in interpreter interp's result.

       Tk_GetScrollInfo is identical in function to Tk_GetScrollInfoObj.  However, Tk_GetScrollInfo accepts string arguments, making it more appropriate for use with legacy widgets.
