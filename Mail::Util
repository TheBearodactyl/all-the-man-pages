NAME
       Mail::Util - mail utility functions

INHERITANCE
        Mail::Util
          is a Exporter

SYNOPSIS
         use Mail::Util qw( ... );

DESCRIPTION
       This package provides several mail related utility functions. Any function required must by explicitly listed on the use line to be exported into the calling package.

FUNCTIONS
       mailaddress( [$address] )
           Return a guess at the current users mail address. The user can force the return value by setting the MAILADDRESS environment variable.  [2.10] You may set the $address via the parameter.

           WARNING: When not supplied via the environment variable, <mailaddress> looks at various configuration files and other environmental data. Although this seems to be smart behavior, this is not
           predictable enough (IMHO) to be used.  Please set the MAILADDRESS explicitly, and do not trust on the "automatic detection", even when that produces a correct address (on the moment)

           example:

            # in your main script
            $ENV{MAILADDRESS} = 'me@example.com';

            # everywhere else
            use Mail::Util 'mailaddress';
            print mailaddress;

            # since v2.10
            mailaddress "me@example.com";

       maildomain()
           Attempt to determine the current user mail domain string via the following methods

           •   Look for the MAILDOMAIN environment variable, which can be set from outside the program.  This is by far the best way to configure the domain.

           •   Look for a sendmail.cf file and extract DH parameter

           •   Look for a smail config file and usr the first host defined in hostname(s)

           •   Try an SMTP connect (if Net::SMTP exists) first to mailhost then localhost

           •   Use value from Net::Domain::domainname (if Net::Domain exists)

           WARNING: On modern machines, there is only one good way to provide information to this method: the first; always explicitly configure the MAILDOMAIN.

           example:

            # in your main script
            $ENV{MAILDOMAIN} = 'example.com';

            # everywhere else
            use Mail::Util 'maildomain';
            print maildomain;

       read_mbox($file)
           Read $file, a binmail mailbox file, and return a list of  references.  Each reference is a reference to an array containing one message.

           WARNING: This method does not quote lines which accidentally also start with the message separator "From", so this implementation can be considered broken.  See Mail::Box::Mbox
