DESCRIPTION
       TIFFDefaultStripSize()  returns  the  number  of  rows  for  a reasonable-sized strip according to the current settings of the ImageWidth, BitsPerSample and SamplesPerPixel, tags and any compres‐
       sion-specific requirements. If the estimate parameter, sf non-zero, then it is taken as an estimate of the desired strip size and adjusted according to any compression-specific requirements.  The
       value  returned  by this function is typically used to define the RowsPerStrip tag. In lieu of any unusual requirements TIFFDefaultStripSize tries to create strips that have approximately 8 kilo‐
       bytes of uncompressed data.

       TIFFStripSize() returns the equivalent size for a strip of data as it would be returned in a call to TIFFReadEncodedStrip() or as it would be expected in a call to TIFFWriteEncodedStrip().  If an
       error occurs, 0 is returned.

       TIFFStripSize64() returns the equivalent size for a strip of data as uint64_t.  If an error occurs, 0 is returned.

       TIFFVStripSize() returns the number of bytes in a strip with nrows rows of data.  If an error occurs, 0 is returned.

       TIFFVStripSize64() returns the number of bytes in a strip with nrows rows of data as uint64_t.  If an error occurs, 0 is returned.

       TIFFRawStripSize() returns the number of bytes in a raw strip (i.e. not decoded).  If an error occurs, 0xFFFFFFFF (=(tmsize_t(-1)) is returned.

       TIFFRawStripSize64() returns the number of bytes in a raw strip as uint64_t.  If an error occurs, 0xFFFFFFFF (=(uint64_t(-1)) is returned.

       TIFFComputeStrip()  returns the strip that contains the specified coordinates. A valid strip is always returned; out-of-range coordinate values are clamped to the bounds of the image. The row pa‐
       rameter is always used in calculating a strip. The sample parameter is used only if data are organized in separate planes (PlanarConfiguration = 2).

       TIFFNumberOfStrips() returns the number of strips in the image.

       TIFFSetupStrips() setup  or reset strip parameters and strip array memory.

DIAGNOSTICS
       None.
