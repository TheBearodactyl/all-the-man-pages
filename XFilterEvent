NAME
       XFilterEvent - filter X events for an input method

SYNTAX
       Bool XFilterEvent(XEvent *event, Window w);

ARGUMENTS
       event     Specifies the event to filter.

       w         Specifies the window for which the filter is to be applied.

DESCRIPTION
       If the window argument is None, XFilterEvent applies the filter to the window specified in the XEvent structure.  The window argument is provided so that layers above Xlib that do event redirect‐
       ion can indicate to which window an event has been redirected.

       If XFilterEvent returns True, then some input method has filtered the event, and the client should discard the event.  If XFilterEvent returns False, then the client  should  continue  processing
       the event.

       If a grab has occurred in the client and XFilterEvent returns True, the client should ungrab the keyboard.
