ZIP_SET_FILE_COMPRESSION(3)                                                            BSD Library Functions Manual                                                            ZIP_SET_FILE_COMPRESSION(3)

NAME
     zip_set_file_compression â€” set compression method for file in zip

LIBRARY
     libzip (-lzip)

SYNOPSIS
     #include <zip.h>

     int
     zip_set_file_compression(zip_t *archive, zip_uint64_t index, zip_int32_t comp, zip_uint32_t comp_flags);

DESCRIPTION
     The zip_set_file_compression() function sets the compression method for the file at position index in the zip archive to comp with the compression method specific comp_flags.  The comp is the same
     as returned by zip_stat(3).  For the comp argument, currently only the following values are supported:

     ZIP_CM_DEFAULT     default compression; currently the same as ZIP_CM_DEFLATE, but flags are ignored.

     ZIP_CM_STORE       Store the file uncompressed.

     ZIP_CM_BZIP2       Compress the file using the bzip2(1) algorithm.

     ZIP_CM_DEFLATE     Deflate the file with the zlib(3) algorithm and default options.

     ZIP_CM_XZ          Use the xz(1) algorithm for compression

     ZIP_CM_ZSTD        Use the zstd(1) algorithm for compression

     NOTE: Only the deflate and store methods can be assumed to be universally supported.

     The comp_flags argument defines the compression level.  This value is dependent on the compression algorithm.  In general, lower numbers mean faster de/compression and higher numbers mean slower
     de/compression.  For ZIP_CM_BZIP, ZIP_CM_DEFLATE, and ZIP_CM_XZ 1 is the fastest compression and 9 the best, 0 chooses the default.  For ZIP_CM_ZSTD possible values are ZSTD_minCLevel(3) to
     ZSTD_maxCLevel(3).

     Further compression method specific flags might be added over time.

     The current compression method for a file in a zip archive can be determined using zip_stat(3).

RETURN VALUES
     Upon successful completion 0 is returned.  Otherwise, -1 is returned and the error information in archive is set to indicate the error.

ERRORS
     zip_set_file_compression() fails if:

     [ZIP_ER_COMPNOTSUPP]
                        Unsupported compression method requested.

     [ZIP_ER_INVAL]     index is not a valid file index in archive, or the argument combination is invalid.

     [ZIP_ER_RDONLY]    Read-only zip file, no changes allowed.
