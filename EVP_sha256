NAME
       EVP_sha224, EVP_sha256, EVP_sha512_224, EVP_sha512_256, EVP_sha384, EVP_sha512 - SHA-2 For EVP

SYNOPSIS
        #include <openssl/evp.h>

        const EVP_MD *EVP_sha224(void);
        const EVP_MD *EVP_sha256(void);
        const EVP_MD *EVP_sha512_224(void);
        const EVP_MD *EVP_sha512_256(void);
        const EVP_MD *EVP_sha384(void);
        const EVP_MD *EVP_sha512(void);

DESCRIPTION
       SHA-2 (Secure Hash Algorithm 2) is a family of cryptographic hash functions standardized in NIST FIPS 180-4, first published in 2001.

       EVP_sha224(), EVP_sha256(), EVP_sha512_224, EVP_sha512_256, EVP_sha384(), EVP_sha512()
           The SHA-2 SHA-224, SHA-256, SHA-512/224, SHA512/256, SHA-384 and SHA-512 algorithms, which generate 224, 256, 224, 256, 384 and 512 bits respectively of output from a given input.

           The two algorithms: SHA-512/224 and SHA512/256 are truncated forms of the SHA-512 algorithm. They are distinct from SHA-224 and SHA-256 even though their outputs are of the same size.

RETURN VALUES
       These functions return a EVP_MD structure that contains the implementation of the message digest. See EVP_MD_meth_new(3) for details of the EVP_MD structure.

CONFORMING TO
       NIST FIPS 180-4.
