NAME
       ostree-sign - Sign a commit

SYNOPSIS
       ostree sign [OPTIONS...] {COMMIT} {KEY-ID...}

DESCRIPTION
       Add a new signature to a commit. Note that currently, this will append
       a new signature even if the commit is already signed with a given key.

       There are several "well-known" system places for `ed25519` trusted and
       revoked public keys -- expected single base64-encoded key per line.

       Files:

       •   /etc/ostree/trusted.ed25519

       •   /etc/ostree/revoked.ed25519

       •   /usr/share/ostree/trusted.ed25519

       •   /usr/share/ostree/revoked.ed25519

       Directories containing files with keys:

       •   /etc/ostree/trusted.ed25519.d

       •   /etc/ostree/revoked.ed25519.d

       •   /usr/share/ostree/trusted.ed25519.d

       •   /usr/share/ostree/rvokeded.ed25519.d
