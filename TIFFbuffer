NAME
       TIFFbuffer - I/O buffering control routines

SYNOPSIS
          #include <tiffio.h>

       int TIFFReadBufferSetup(TIFF *tif, tdata_t buffer, tsize_t size)

       int TIFFWriteBufferSetup(TIFF *tif, tdata_t buffer, tsize_t size)

DESCRIPTION
       The  following  routines  are provided for client-control of the I/O buffers used by the library. Applications need never use these routines; they are provided only for “intelligent clients” that
       wish to optimize memory usage and/or eliminate potential copy operations that can occur when working with images that have data stored without compression.

       TIFFReadBufferSetup() sets up the data buffer used to read raw (encoded) data from a file. If the specified pointer is NULL (zero), then a buffer of the appropriate size is  allocated.  Otherwise
       the caller must guarantee that the buffer is large enough to hold any individual strip of raw data.  TIFFReadBufferSetup() returns a non-zero value if the setup was successful and zero otherwise.

       TIFFWriteBufferSetup()  sets  up  the data buffer used to write raw (encoded) data to a file. If the specified size is -1, then the buffer size is selected to hold a complete tile or strip, or at
       least 8 kilobytes, whichever is greater. If the specified buffer is NULL (zero), then a buffer of the appropriate size is dynamically allocated.  TIFFWriteBufferSetup() returns a  non-zero  value
       if the setup was successful and zero otherwise.

DIAGNOSTICS
       %s: No space for data buffer at scanline %ld:
          TIFFReadBufferSetup() was unable to dynamically allocate space for a data buffer.

       %s: No space for output buffer:
          TIFFWriteBufferSetup() was unable to dynamically allocate space for a data buffer.
