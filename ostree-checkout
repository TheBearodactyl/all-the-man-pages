NAME
       ostree-checkout - Check out a commit into a filesystem

SYNOPSIS
       ostree checkout [OPTIONS...] {COMMIT} [DESTINATION]

DESCRIPTION
       Checks out the given commit into the filesystem under directory
       DESTINATION. If DESTINATION is not specified, the COMMIT will become
       the destination checkout target. If COMMIT destination already exists,
       command will error unless --union option is selected.

OPTIONS
       --user-mode, -U
           Do not change file ownership or initialize extended attributes.

       --subpath="PATH"
           Checkout sub-directory PATH.

       --union
           Keep existing directories and unchanged files, overwrite existing
           files.

       --union-add
           Keep existing directories and files.

       --union-identical
           Like --union, but error out if a file would be replaced with a
           different file. Add new files and directories, ignore identical
           files, and keep existing directories. Requires -H.

       --whiteouts
           Process whiteout files (Docker style).

       --process-passthrough-whiteouts
           Enable overlayfs whiteout extraction into 0:0 character devices.
           Overlayfs whiteouts are encoded inside ostree as
           .ostree-wh.filename and extracted as 0:0 character devices. This is
           useful to carry container storage embedded into ostree.

       --allow-noent
           Do nothing if specified path does not exist.

       --from-stdin
           Process many checkouts from standard input.

       --from-file="FILE"
           Process many checkouts from input file.

       --fsync="POLICY"
           POLICY is a boolean which specifies whether fsync should be used or
           not. Default to true.

       --require-hardlinks, -H
           Do not fall back to full copies if hardlinking fails.

       --force-copy-zerosized, -z
           This option does nothing; the functionality is now always on by
           default.

       --force-copy, -C
           Never hardlink (but may reflink if available).

       --bareuseronly-dirs, -M
           Suppress mode bits outside of 0775 for directories (suid, world
           writable, etc.).

       --skip-list="FILE"
           Skip checking out the absolute file paths listed in FILE, one per
           line.

       --selinux-policy
           Set SELinux labels based on policy in root filesystem PATH (may be
           /). This implies --force-copy.

EXAMPLE
       $ ostree checkout my-branch

       $ ls

                   file1    file2    my-branch
