NAME
       gnutls_cipher_get_iv_size - API function

SYNOPSIS
       #include <gnutls/crypto.h>

       unsigned gnutls_cipher_get_iv_size(gnutls_cipher_algorithm_t algorithm);

ARGUMENTS
       gnutls_cipher_algorithm_t algorithm
                   is an encryption algorithm

DESCRIPTION
       This function returns the size of the initialization vector (IV) for the provided algorithm. For algorithms with variable size IV (e.g., AES-CCM), the returned size will be the one used by TLS.

RETURNS
       block size for encryption algorithm.

SINCE
       3.2.0
