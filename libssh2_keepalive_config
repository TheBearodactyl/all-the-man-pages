NAME
       libssh2_keepalive_config - short function description

SYNOPSIS
       #include <libssh2.h>

       void libssh2_keepalive_config(LIBSSH2_SESSION *session,
                                     int want_reply,
                                     unsigned interval);

DESCRIPTION
       Set  how often keepalive messages should be sent. want_reply indicates whether the keepalive messages should request a response from the server.  interval is number of seconds that can pass with‚Äê
       out any I/O, use 0 (the default) to disable keepalives.  To avoid some busy-loop corner-cases, if you specify an interval of 1 it will be treated as 2.

       Note that non-blocking applications are responsible for sending the keepalive messages using libssh2_keepalive_send(3).

RETURN VALUE
       Nothing

AVAILABILITY
