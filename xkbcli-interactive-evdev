NAME
     xkbcli interactive-evdev — interactive debugger for XKB keymaps

SYNOPSIS
     xkbcli interactive-evdev [options]

DESCRIPTION
     xkbcli interactive-evdev is a commandline tool to interactively debug XKB keymaps by listening to /dev/input/eventX evdev devices.

     xkbcli interactive-evdev requires permission to open the evdev device nodes.  This usually requires being the “root” user or belonging to the “input” group.
