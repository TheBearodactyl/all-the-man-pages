DESCRIPTION
       This tool is part of the samba(7) suite.

       The smbcacls program manipulates NT Access Control Lists (ACLs) on SMB
       file shares. An ACL is comprised zero or more Access Control Entries
       (ACEs), which define access restrictions for a specific user or group.

OPTIONS
       The following options are available to the smbcacls program. The format
       of ACLs is described in the section ACL FORMAT

       -a|--add acl
           Add the entries specified to the ACL. Existing access control
           entries are unchanged.

       -M|--modify acl
           Modify the mask value (permissions) for the ACEs specified on the
           command line. An error will be printed for each ACE specified that
           was not already present in the object's ACL.

       -D|--delete acl
           Delete any ACEs specified on the command line. An error will be
           printed for each ACE specified that was not already present in the
           object's ACL.

       -S|--set acl
           This command sets the ACL on the object with only what is specified
           on the command line. Any existing ACL is erased. Note that the ACL
           specified must contain at least a revision, type, owner and group
           for the call to succeed.

       -C|--chown name
           The owner of a file or directory can be changed to the name given
           using the -C option. The name can be a sid in the form S-1-x-y-z or
           a name resolved against the server specified in the first argument.

           This command is a shortcut for -M OWNER:name.

       -G|--chgrp name
           The group owner of a file or directory can be changed to the name
           given using the -G option. The name can be a sid in the form
           S-1-x-y-z or a name resolved against the server specified n the
           first argument.

           This command is a shortcut for -M GROUP:name.

       -I|--inherit allow|remove|copy
           Set or unset the windows "Allow inheritable permissions" check box
           using the -I option. To set the check box pass allow. To unset the
           check box pass either remove or copy. Remove will remove all
           inherited ACEs. Copy will copy all the inherited ACEs.

       --propagate-inheritance
           Add, modify, delete or set ACEs on an entire directory tree
           according to the inheritance flags. Refer to the INHERITANCE
           section for details.

       --numeric
           This option displays all ACL information in numeric format. The
           default is to convert SIDs to names and ACE types and masks to a
           readable string format.

       -m|--max-protocol PROTOCOL_NAME
           This allows the user to select the highest SMB protocol level that
           smbcacls will use to connect to the server. By default this is set
           to NT1, which is the highest available SMB1 protocol. To connect
           using SMB2 or SMB3 protocol, use the strings SMB2 or SMB3
           respectively. Note that to connect to a Windows 2012 server with
           encrypted transport selecting a max-protocol of SMB3 is required.

       -t|--test-args
           Don't actually do anything, only validate the correctness of the
           arguments.

       --query-security-info FLAGS
           The security-info flags for queries.

       --set-security-info FLAGS
           The security-info flags for queries.

       --sddl
           Output and input acls in sddl format.

       --domain-sid SID
           SID used for sddl processing.

       -x|--maximum-access
           When displaying an ACL additionally query the server for effective
           maximum permissions. Note that this is only supported with SMB
           protocol version 2 or higher.

       -?|--help
           Print a summary of command line options.

       --usage
           Display brief usage message.

       -d|--debuglevel=DEBUGLEVEL
           level is an integer from 0 to 10. The default value if this
           parameter is not specified is 1 for client applications.

           The higher this value, the more detail will be logged to the log
           files about the activities of the server. At level 0, only critical
           errors and serious warnings will be logged. Level 1 is a reasonable
           level for day-to-day running - it generates a small amount of
           information about operations carried out.

           Levels above 1 will generate considerable amounts of log data, and
           should only be used when investigating a problem. Levels above 3
           are designed for use only by developers and generate HUGE amounts
           of log data, most of which is extremely cryptic.

           Note that specifying this parameter here will override the log
           level parameter in the /etc/samba/smb.conf file.

       --debug-stdout
           This will redirect debug output to STDOUT. By default all clients
           are logging to STDERR.

       --configfile=<configuration file>
           The file specified contains the configuration details required by
           the client. The information in this file can be general for client
           and server or only provide client specific like options such as
           client smb encrypt. See /etc/samba/smb.conf for more information.
           The default configuration file name is determined at compile time.

       --option=<name>=<value>
           Set the smb.conf(5) option "<name>" to value "<value>" from the
           command line. This overrides compiled-in defaults and options read
           from the configuration file. If a name or a value includes a space,
           wrap whole --option=name=value into quotes.

       -l|--log-basename=logdirectory
           Base directory name for log/debug files. The extension ".progname"
           will be appended (e.g. log.smbclient, log.smbd, etc...). The log
           file is never removed by the client.

       --leak-report
           Enable talloc leak reporting on exit.

       --leak-report-full
           Enable full talloc leak reporting on exit.

       -V|--version
           Prints the program version number.

       -R|--name-resolve=NAME-RESOLVE-ORDER
           This option is used to determine what naming services and in what
           order to resolve host names to IP addresses. The option takes a
           space-separated string of different name resolution options. The
           best ist to wrap the whole --name-resolve=NAME-RESOLVE-ORDER into
           quotes.

           The options are: "lmhosts", "host", "wins" and "bcast". They cause
           names to be resolved as follows:

                  •   lmhosts: Lookup an IP address in the Samba lmhosts file.
                      If the line in lmhosts has no name type attached to the
                      NetBIOS name (see the lmhosts(5) for details) then any
                      name type matches for lookup.

                  •   host: Do a standard host name to IP address resolution,
                      using the system /etc/hosts, NIS, or DNS lookups. This
                      method of name resolution is operating system dependent,
                      for instance on IRIX or Solaris this may be controlled
                      by the /etc/nsswitch.conf file). Note that this method
                      is only used if the NetBIOS name type being queried is
                      the 0x20 (server) name type, otherwise it is ignored.

                  •   wins: Query a name with the IP address listed in the
                      wins server parameter. If no WINS server has been
                      specified this method will be ignored.

                  •   bcast: Do a broadcast on each of the known local
                      interfaces listed in the interfaces parameter. This is
                      the least reliable of the name resolution methods as it
                      depends on the target host being on a locally connected
                      subnet.

           If this parameter is not set then the name resolve order defined in
           the /etc/samba/smb.conf file parameter (name resolve order) will be
           used.

           The default order is lmhosts, host, wins, bcast. Without this
           parameter or any entry in the name resolve order parameter of the
           /etc/samba/smb.conf file, the name resolution methods will be
           attempted in this order.

       -O|--socket-options=SOCKETOPTIONS
           TCP socket options to set on the client socket. See the socket
           options parameter in the /etc/samba/smb.conf manual page for the
           list of valid options.

       -m|--max-protocol=MAXPROTOCOL
           The value of the parameter (a string) is the highest protocol level
           that will be supported by the client.

           Note that specifying this parameter here will override the client
           max protocol parameter in the /etc/samba/smb.conf file.

       -n|--netbiosname=NETBIOSNAME
           This option allows you to override the NetBIOS name that Samba uses
           for itself. This is identical to setting the netbios name parameter
           in the /etc/samba/smb.conf file. However, a command line setting
           will take precedence over settings in /etc/samba/smb.conf.

       --netbios-scope=SCOPE
           This specifies a NetBIOS scope that nmblookup will use to
           communicate with when generating NetBIOS names. For details on the
           use of NetBIOS scopes, see rfc1001.txt and rfc1002.txt. NetBIOS
           scopes are very rarely used, only set this parameter if you are the
           system administrator in charge of all the NetBIOS systems you
           communicate with.

       -W|--workgroup=WORKGROUP
           Set the SMB domain of the username. This overrides the default
           domain which is the domain defined in smb.conf. If the domain
           specified is the same as the servers NetBIOS name, it causes the
           client to log on using the servers local SAM (as opposed to the
           Domain SAM).

           Note that specifying this parameter here will override the
           workgroup parameter in the /etc/samba/smb.conf file.

       -r|--realm=REALM
           Set the realm for the domain.

           Note that specifying this parameter here will override the realm
           parameter in the /etc/samba/smb.conf file.

       -U|--user=[DOMAIN\]USERNAME[%PASSWORD]
           Sets the SMB username or username and password.

           If %PASSWORD is not specified, the user will be prompted. The
           client will first check the USER environment variable (which is
           also permitted to also contain the password separated by a %), then
           the LOGNAME variable (which is not permitted to contain a password)
           and if either exists, the value is used. If these environmental
           variables are not found, the username found in a Kerberos
           Credentials cache may be used.

           A third option is to use a credentials file which contains the
           plaintext of the username and password. This option is mainly
           provided for scripts where the admin does not wish to pass the
           credentials on the command line or via environment variables. If
           this method is used, make certain that the permissions on the file
           restrict access from unwanted users. See the -A for more details.

           Be cautious about including passwords in scripts or passing
           user-supplied values onto the command line. For security it is
           better to let the Samba client tool ask for the password if needed,
           or obtain the password once with kinit.

           While Samba will attempt to scrub the password from the process
           title (as seen in ps), this is after startup and so is subject to a
           race.

       -N|--no-pass
           If specified, this parameter suppresses the normal password prompt
           from the client to the user. This is useful when accessing a
           service that does not require a password.

           Unless a password is specified on the command line or this
           parameter is specified, the client will request a password.

           If a password is specified on the command line and this option is
           also defined the password on the command line will be silently
           ignored and no password will be used.

       --password
           Specify the password on the commandline.

           Be cautious about including passwords in scripts or passing
           user-supplied values onto the command line. For security it is
           better to let the Samba client tool ask for the password if needed,
           or obtain the password once with kinit.

           If --password is not specified, the tool will check the PASSWD
           environment variable, followed by PASSWD_FD which is expected to
           contain an open file descriptor (FD) number.

           Finally it will check PASSWD_FILE (containing a file path to be
           opened). The file should only contain the password. Make certain
           that the permissions on the file restrict access from unwanted
           users!

           While Samba will attempt to scrub the password from the process
           title (as seen in ps), this is after startup and so is subject to a
           race.

       --pw-nt-hash
           The supplied password is the NT hash.

       -A|--authentication-file=filename
           This option allows you to specify a file from which to read the
           username and password used in the connection. The format of the
           file is:

                                   username = <value>
                                   password = <value>
                                   domain   = <value>

           Make certain that the permissions on the file restrict access from
           unwanted users!

       -P|--machine-pass
           Use stored machine account password.

       --simple-bind-dn=DN
           DN to use for a simple bind.

       --use-kerberos=desired|required|off
           This parameter determines whether Samba client tools will try to
           authenticate using Kerberos. For Kerberos authentication you need
           to use dns names instead of IP addresses when connecting to a
           service.

           Note that specifying this parameter here will override the client
           use kerberos parameter in the /etc/samba/smb.conf file.

       --use-krb5-ccache=CCACHE
           Specifies the credential cache location for Kerberos
           authentication.

           This will set --use-kerberos=required too.

       --use-winbind-ccache
           Try to use the credential cache by winbind.

       --client-protection=sign|encrypt|off
           Sets the connection protection the client tool should use.

           Note that specifying this parameter here will override the client
           protection parameter in the /etc/samba/smb.conf file.

           In case you need more fine grained control you can use:
           --option=clientsmbencrypt=OPTION, --option=clientipcsigning=OPTION,
           --option=clientsigning=OPTION.

ACL FORMAT
       The format of an ACL is one or more entries separated by either commas
       or newlines. An ACL entry is one of the following:

           REVISION:<revision number>
           OWNER:<sid or name>
           GROUP:<sid or name>
           ACL:<sid or name>:<type>/<flags>/<mask>

       Control bits related to automatic inheritance

              •   OD - "Owner Defaulted" - Indicates that the SID of the owner
                  of the security descriptor was provided by a default
                  mechanism.

              •   GD - "Group Defaulted" - Indicates that the SID of the
                  security descriptor group was provided by a default
                  mechanism.

              •   DP - "DACL Present" - Indicates a security descriptor that
                  has a discretionary access control list (DACL).

              •   DD - "DACL Defaulted" - Indicates a security descriptor with
                  a default DACL.

              •   SP - "SACL Present" - Indicates a security descriptor that
                  has a system access control list (SACL).

              •   SD - "SACL Defaulted" - A default mechanism, rather than the
                  original provider of the security descriptor, provided the
                  SACL.

              •   DT - "DACL Trusted"

              •   SS - "Server Security"

              •   DR - "DACL Inheritance Required" - Indicates a required
                  security descriptor in which the DACL is set up to support
                  automatic propagation of inheritable access control entries
                  (ACEs) to existing child objects.

              •   SR - "SACL Inheritance Required" - Indicates a required
                  security descriptor in which the SACL is set up to support
                  automatic propagation of inheritable ACEs to existing child
                  objects.

              •   DI - "DACL Auto Inherited" - Indicates a security descriptor
                  in which the DACL is set up to support automatic propagation
                  of inheritable access control entries (ACEs) to existing
                  child objects.

              •   SI - "SACL Auto Inherited" - Indicates a security descriptor
                  in which the SACL is set up to support automatic propagation
                  of inheritable ACEs to existing child objects.

              •   PD - "DACL Protected" - Prevents the DACL of the security
                  descriptor from being modified by inheritable ACEs.

              •   PS - "SACL Protected" - Prevents the SACL of the security
                  descriptor from being modified by inheritable ACEs.

              •   RM - "RM Control Valid" - Indicates that the resource
                  manager control is valid.

              •   SR - "Self Relative" - Indicates a self-relative security
                  descriptor.

       The revision of the ACL specifies the internal Windows NT ACL revision
       for the security descriptor. If not specified it defaults to 1. Using
       values other than 1 may cause strange behaviour.

       The owner and group specify the owner and group sids for the object. If
       a SID in the format S-1-x-y-z is specified this is used, otherwise the
       name specified is resolved using the server on which the file or
       directory resides.

       ACEs are specified with an "ACL:" prefix, and define permissions
       granted to an SID. The SID again can be specified in S-1-x-y-z format
       or as a name in which case it is resolved against the server on which
       the file or directory resides. The type, flags and mask values
       determine the type of access granted to the SID.

       The type can be either ALLOWED or DENIED to allow/deny access to the
       SID.

       The flags field defines how the ACE should be considered when
       performing inheritance.  smbcacls uses these flags when run with
       --propagate-inheritance.

       Flags can be specified as decimal or hexadecimal values, or with the
       respective (XX) aliases, separated by a vertical bar "|".

              •   (OI) Object Inherit 0x1

              •   (CI) Container Inherit 0x2

              •   (NP) No Propagate Inherit 0x4

              •   (IO) Inherit Only 0x8

              •   (I) ACE was inherited 0x10

       The mask is a value which expresses the access right granted to the
       SID. It can be given as a decimal or hexadecimal value, or by using one
       of the following text strings which map to the NT file permissions of
       the same name.

              •   R - Allow read access

              •   W - Allow write access

              •   X - Execute permission on the object

              •   D - Delete the object

              •   P - Change permissions

              •   O - Take ownership

       The following combined permissions can be specified:

              •   READ - Equivalent to 'RX' permissions

              •   CHANGE - Equivalent to 'RXWD' permissions

              •   FULL - Equivalent to 'RWXDPO' permissions

INHERITANCE
       Per-ACE inheritance flags can be set in the ACE flags field. By
       default, inheritable ACEs e.g. those marked for object inheritance (OI)
       or container inheritance (CI), are not propagated to sub-files or
       folders. However, with the --propagate-inheritance argument specified,
       such ACEs are automatically propagated according to some inheritance
       rules.

              •   Inheritable (OI)(OI) ACE flags can only be applied to
                  folders.

              •   Any inheritable ACEs applied to sub-files or folders are
                  marked with the inherited (I) flag. Inheritable ACE(s) are
                  applied to folders unless the no propagation (NP) flag is
                  set.

              •   When an ACE with the (OI) flag alone set is propagated to a
                  child folder the inheritance only flag (IO) is also applied.
                  This indicates the permissions associated with the ACE don't
                  apply to the folder itself (only to it's child files). When
                  applying the ACE to a child file the ACE is inherited as
                  normal.

              •   When an ace with the (CI) flag alone set is propagated to a
                  child file there is no effect, when propagated to a child
                  folder it is inherited as normal.

              •   When an ACE that has both (OI) & (CI) flags set the ACE is
                  inherited as normal by both folders and files.

       Files and folders with protected ACLs do not allow inheritable
       permissions (set with -I). Such objects will not receive ACEs flagged
       for inheritance with (CI) or (OI).

EXIT STATUS
       The smbcacls program sets the exit status depending on the success or
       otherwise of the operations performed. The exit status may be one of
       the following values.

       If the operation succeeded, smbcacls returns and exit status of 0. If
       smbcacls couldn't connect to the specified server, or there was an
       error getting or setting the ACLs, an exit status of 1 is returned. If
       there was an error parsing any command line arguments, an exit status
       of 2 is returned.
