NAME
       Test2::Hub::Subtest - Hub used by subtests

DESCRIPTION
       Subtests make use of this hub to route events.

TOGGLES
       $bool = $hub->manual_skip_all
       $hub->set_manual_skip_all($bool)
           The default is false.

           Normally a skip-all plan event will cause a subtest to stop executing. This is accomplished via "last LABEL" to a label inside the subtest code. Most of the time this is perfectly fine. There
           are times however where this flow control causes bad things to happen.

           This toggle lets you turn off the abort logic for the hub. When this is toggled to true you are responsible for ensuring no additional events are generated.
