NAME
       CMS_verify_receipt - verify a CMS signed receipt

SYNOPSIS
        #include <openssl/cms.h>

        int CMS_verify_receipt(CMS_ContentInfo *rcms, CMS_ContentInfo *ocms,
                               STACK_OF(X509) *certs, X509_STORE *store,
                               unsigned int flags);

DESCRIPTION
       CMS_verify_receipt() verifies a CMS signed receipt. rcms is the signed receipt to verify. ocms is the original SignedData structure containing the receipt request. certs is a set of certificates
       in which to search for the signing certificate. store is a trusted certificate store (used for chain verification).

       flags is an optional set of flags, which can be used to modify the verify operation.

NOTES
       This functions behaves in a similar way to CMS_verify() except the flag values CMS_DETACHED, CMS_BINARY, CMS_TEXT and CMS_STREAM are not supported since they do not make sense in the context of
       signed receipts.

RETURN VALUES
       CMS_verify_receipt() returns 1 for a successful verification and zero if an error occurred.

       The error can be obtained from ERR_get_error(3)
