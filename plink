plink(1)                       PuTTY tool suite                       plink(1)

NAME
       plink - PuTTY link, command line network connection tool

SYNOPSIS
       plink [options] [user@]host [command]

DESCRIPTION
       plink is a network connection tool supporting several protocols.

OPTIONS
       The command-line options supported by plink are:

       -V     Show version information and exit.

       -pgpfp Display  the fingerprints of the PuTTY PGP Master Keys and exit,
              to aid in verifying new files released by the PuTTY team.

       -v     Show verbose messages.

       -load session
              Load settings from saved session.

       -ssh   Force use of SSH protocol (default).

       -telnet
              Force use of Telnet protocol.

       -rlogin
              Force use of rlogin protocol.

       -raw   Force raw mode.

       -serial
              Force serial mode.

       -ssh-connection
              Force use of the `bare ssh-connection' protocol.  This  is  only
              likely  to be useful when connecting to a psusan(1) server, most
              likely with an absolute path to a Unix-domain socket in place of
              host.

       -proxycmd command
              Instead of making a TCP connection, use command as a proxy; net‐
              work traffic will be redirected to the standard input and output
              of  command. command must be a single word, so is likely to need
              quoting by the shell.

              The special strings %host and %port in command will be  replaced
              by the hostname and port number you want to connect to; to get a
              literal % sign, enter %%.

              Backslash escapes are also supported, such as sequences like  \n
              being replaced by a literal newline; to get a literal backslash,
              enter \\. (Further escaping may be required by the shell.)

              (See the main PuTTY manual for full details of the supported  %-
              and backslash-delimited tokens, although most of them are proba‐
              bly not very useful in this context.)

       -P port
              Connect to port port.

       -l user
              Set remote username to user.

       -m path
              Read remote command(s) from local file path.

       -batch Disable interactive prompts.

       -sanitise-stderr

       -sanitise-stdout

       -no-sanitise-stderr

       -no-sanitise-stdout
              By default, Plink can choose to  filter  control  characters  if
              that seems appropriate, to prevent remote processes sending con‐
              fusing escape sequences. These options override Plink's  default
              behaviour  to enable or disabling such filtering on the standard
              error and standard output channels.

       -pwfile filename
              Open the specified file, and use the first  line  of  text  read
              from it as the remote password.

       -pw password
              Set  remote password to password. CAUTION: this will likely make
              the password visible to other users of the  local  machine  (via
              commands such as `ps' or `w'). Use -pwfile instead.

       -L [srcaddr:]srcport:desthost:destport
              Set  up  a  local  port  forwarding:  listen  on srcport (or sr‐
              caddr:srcport if specified), and forward  any  connections  over
              the SSH connection to the destination address desthost:destport.
              Only works in SSH.

       -R [srcaddr:]srcport:desthost:destport
              Set up a remote port forwarding: ask the SSH server to listen on
              srcport  (or  srcaddr:srcport  if specified), and to forward any
              connections back over the SSH connection where the  client  will
              pass  them on to the destination address desthost:destport. Only
              works in SSH.

       -D [srcaddr:]srcport
              Set up dynamic port forwarding. The client  listens  on  srcport
              (or  srcaddr:srcport  if  specified),  and  implements  a  SOCKS
              server. So you can point SOCKS-aware applications at  this  port
              and they will automatically use the SSH connection to tunnel all
              their connections. Only works in SSH.

       -X     Enable X11 forwarding.

       -x     Disable X11 forwarding (default).

       -A     Enable agent forwarding.

       -a     Disable agent forwarding (default).

       -t     Enable pty allocation (default if a command is NOT specified).

       -T     Disable pty allocation (default if a command is specified).

       -1     Force use of SSH protocol version 1.

       -2     Force use of SSH protocol version 2.

       -4, -6 Force use of IPv4 or IPv6 for network connections.

       -C     Enable SSH compression.

       -i keyfile
              Private key file for user authentication. For SSH-2  keys,  this
              key  file must be in PuTTY's PPK format, not OpenSSH's format or
              anyone else's.

              If you are using an authentication agent, you can also specify a
              public  key  here  (in  RFC 4716 or OpenSSH format), to identify
              which of the agent's keys to use.

       -noagent
              Don't try to use an authentication agent for  local  authentica‐
              tion. (This doesn't affect agent forwarding.)

       -agent Allow  use of an authentication agent. (This option is only nec‐
              essary to override a setting in a saved session.)

       -no-trivial-auth
              Disconnect from any  SSH  server  which  accepts  authentication
              without  ever having asked for any kind of password or signature
              or token. (You might want to enable this for a server you always
              expect  to challenge you, for instance to ensure you don't acci‐
              dentally type your key  file's  passphrase  into  a  compromised
              server spoofing Plink's passphrase prompt.)

       -noshare
              Don't  test and try to share an existing connection, always make
              a new connection.

       -share Test and try to share an existing connection.

       -hostkey key
              Specify an acceptable host public key. This option may be speci‐
              fied  multiple  times;  each  key  can  be  either a fingerprint
              (SHA256:AbCdE..., 99:aa:bb:..., etc) or a base64-encoded blob in
              OpenSSH's one-line format.

              Specifying  this option overrides automated host key management;
              only the key(s) specified on the command-line will  be  accepted
              (unless  a saved session also overrides host keys, in which case
              those will be added to), and the host  key  cache  will  not  be
              written.

       -s     Remote command is SSH subsystem (SSH-2 only).

       -N     Don't start a remote command or shell at all (SSH-2 only).

       -nc host:port
              Make  a  remote  network  connection  from the server instead of
              starting a shell or command.

       -sercfg configuration-string
              Specify the configuration parameters for  the  serial  port,  in
              -serial  mode.  configuration-string should be a comma-separated
              list of configuration parameters as follows:

              •      Any single digit from 5 to 9  sets  the  number  of  data
                     bits.

              •      `1', `1.5' or `2' sets the number of stop bits.

              •      Any other numeric string is interpreted as a baud rate.

              •      A  single lower-case letter specifies the parity: `n' for
                     none, `o' for odd, `e' for even, `m' for mark and `s' for
                     space.

              •      A  single  upper-case  letter specifies the flow control:
                     `N' for none, `X' for XON/XOFF, `R' for RTS/CTS  and  `D'
                     for DSR/DTR.

       -sshlog logfile

       -sshrawlog logfile
              For  SSH  connections, these options make plink log protocol de‐
              tails to a file. (Some of these may be  sensitive,  although  by
              default an effort is made to suppress obvious passwords.)

              -sshlog logs decoded SSH packets and other events (those that -v
              would print). -sshrawlog additionally  logs  the  raw  encrypted
              packet data.

       -logoverwrite
              If  Plink  is configured to write to a log file that already ex‐
              ists, discard the existing file.

       -logappend
              If Plink is configured to write to a log file that  already  ex‐
              ists, append new log data to the existing file.

       -shareexists
              Instead  of making a new connection, test for the presence of an
              existing connection that can be shared. The desired session  can
              be specified in any of the usual ways.

              Returns  immediately  with a zero exit status if a suitable `up‐
              stream' exists, nonzero otherwise.
