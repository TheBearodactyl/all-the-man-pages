NAME
       gnutls_x509_crt_set_version - API function

SYNOPSIS
       #include <gnutls/x509.h>

       int gnutls_x509_crt_set_version(gnutls_x509_crt_t crt, unsigned int version);

ARGUMENTS
       gnutls_x509_crt_t crt
                   a certificate of type gnutls_x509_crt_t

       unsigned int version
                   holds the version number. For X.509v1 certificates must be 1.

DESCRIPTION
       This function will set the version of the certificate.  This must be one for X.509 version 1, and so on.  Plain certificates without extensions must have version set to one.

       To  create  well-formed  certificates,  you  must  specify  version 3 if you use any certificate extensions.  Extensions are created by functions such as gnutls_x509_crt_set_subject_alt_name() or
       gnutls_x509_crt_set_key_usage().

RETURNS
       On success, GNUTLS_E_SUCCESS (0) is returned, otherwise a negative error value.
