NAME
       CURLOPT_SASL_AUTHZID - authorization identity (identity to act as)

SYNOPSIS
       #include <curl/curl.h>

       CURLcode curl_easy_setopt(CURL *handle, CURLOPT_SASL_AUTHZID, char *authzid);

DESCRIPTION
       Pass  a char * as parameter, which should be pointing to the null-terminated authorization identity (authzid) for the transfer. Only applicable to the PLAIN SASL authentication mechanism where it
       is optional.

       When not specified only the authentication identity (authcid) as specified by the username will be sent to the server, along with the password. The server will derive a authzid from  the  authcid
       when not provided, which it will then uses internally.

       When the authzid is specified, the use of which is server dependent, it can be used to access another user's inbox, that the user has been granted access to, or a shared mailbox for example.

DEFAULT
       blank
