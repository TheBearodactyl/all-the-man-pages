NAME
       gnutls_certificate_verify_peers2 - API function

SYNOPSIS
       #include <gnutls/gnutls.h>

       int gnutls_certificate_verify_peers2(gnutls_session_t session, unsigned int * status);

ARGUMENTS
       gnutls_session_t session
                   is a gnutls session

       unsigned int * status
                   is the output of the verification

DESCRIPTION
       This  function  will  verify  the peer's certificate and store the status in the  status variable as a bitwise OR of gnutls_certificate_status_t values or zero if the certificate is trusted. Note
       that value in  status is set only when the return value of this function is success (i.e, failure to trust a certificate does not imply a negative return value).  The default  verification  flags
       used by this function can be overridden using gnutls_certificate_set_verify_flags().

       This  function  will  take  into  account  the stapled OCSP responses sent by the server, as well as the following X.509 certificate extensions: Name Constraints, Key Usage, and Basic Constraints
       (pathlen).

       Note that you must also check the peer's name in order to check if the verified certificate belongs to the  actual  peer,  see  gnutls_x509_crt_check_hostname(),  or  use  gnutls_certificate_ver‐
       ify_peers3().

       To avoid denial of service attacks some default upper limits regarding the certificate key size and chain size are set. To override them use gnutls_certificate_set_verify_limits().

       Note  that  when using raw public-keys verification will not work because there is no corresponding certificate body belonging to the raw key that can be verified. In that case this function will
       return GNUTLS_E_INVALID_REQUEST.

RETURNS
       GNUTLS_E_SUCCESS (0) when the validation is performed, or a negative error code otherwise.  A successful error code means that the  status parameter must be checked to obtain the validation  sta‐
       tus.
