NAME
       gnutls_ocsp_resp_get_response - API function

SYNOPSIS
       #include <gnutls/ocsp.h>

       int gnutls_ocsp_resp_get_response(gnutls_ocsp_resp_const_t resp, gnutls_datum_t * response_type_oid, gnutls_datum_t * response);

ARGUMENTS
       gnutls_ocsp_resp_const_t resp
                   should contain a gnutls_ocsp_resp_t type

       gnutls_datum_t * response_type_oid
                   newly allocated output buffer with response type OID

       gnutls_datum_t * response
                   newly allocated output buffer with DER encoded response

DESCRIPTION
       This function will extract the response type OID in and the response data from an OCSP response.  Normally the
        response_type_oid is always "1.3.6.1.5.5.7.48.1.1" which means the
        response should be decoded as a Basic OCSP Response, but technically other response types could be used.

       This  function  is typically only useful when you want to extract the response type OID of an response for diagnostic purposes.  Otherwise gnutls_ocsp_resp_import() will decode the basic OCSP re‐
       sponse part and the caller need not worry about that aspect.

       Since 3.7.0  response_type_oid ->size does not account for the terminating null byte.

RETURNS
       On success, GNUTLS_E_SUCCESS (0) is returned, otherwise a negative error value.
