NAME
       gnutls_x509_crt_list_import2 - API function

SYNOPSIS
       #include <gnutls/x509.h>

       int gnutls_x509_crt_list_import2(gnutls_x509_crt_t ** certs, unsigned int * size, const gnutls_datum_t * data, gnutls_x509_crt_fmt_t format, unsigned int flags);

ARGUMENTS
       gnutls_x509_crt_t ** certs
                   Will hold the parsed certificate list.

       unsigned int * size
                   It will contain the size of the list.

       const gnutls_datum_t * data
                   The PEM encoded certificate.

       gnutls_x509_crt_fmt_t format
                   One of DER or PEM.

       unsigned int flags
                   must be (0) or an OR'd sequence of gnutls_certificate_import_flags.

DESCRIPTION
       This function will convert the given PEM encoded certificate list to the native gnutls_x509_crt_t format. The output will be stored in  certs which will be allocated and initialized.

       If the Certificate is PEM encoded it should have a header of "X509 CERTIFICATE", or "CERTIFICATE".

       To deinitialize  certs , you need to deinitialize each crt structure independently, and use gnutls_free() at  certs .

RETURNS
       GNUTLS_E_SUCCESS on success, otherwise a negative error code.

SINCE
       3.0
