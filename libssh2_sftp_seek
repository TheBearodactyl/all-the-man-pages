NAME
       libssh2_sftp_seek - set the read/write position indicator within a file

SYNOPSIS
       #include <libssh2.h>
       #include <libssh2_sftp.h>

       void libssh2_sftp_seek(LIBSSH2_SFTP_HANDLE *handle, size_t offset);

DESCRIPTION
       Deprecated function. Use libssh2_sftp_seek64(3) instead!

       handle - SFTP File Handle as returned by libssh2_sftp_open_ex(3)

       offset - Number of bytes from the beginning of file to seek to.

       Move the file handle's internal pointer to an arbitrary location.  Note that libssh2 implements file pointers as a localized concept to make file access appear more POSIX like. No packets are ex‚Äê
       changed with the server during a seek operation. The localized file pointer is simply used as a convenience offset during read/write operations.
