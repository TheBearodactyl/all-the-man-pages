NAME
       gnutls_session_set_verify_cert - API function

SYNOPSIS
       #include <gnutls/gnutls.h>

       void gnutls_session_set_verify_cert(gnutls_session_t session, const char * hostname, unsigned flags);

ARGUMENTS
       gnutls_session_t session
                   is a gnutls session

       const char * hostname
                   is the expected name of the peer; may be NULL

       unsigned flags
                   flags for certificate verification -- gnutls_certificate_verify_flags

DESCRIPTION
       This  function  instructs GnuTLS to verify the peer's certificate using the provided hostname. If the verification fails the handshake will also fail with GNUTLS_E_CERTIFICATE_VERIFICATION_ERROR.
       In that case the verification result can be obtained using gnutls_session_get_verify_cert_status().

       The  hostname pointer provided must remain valid for the lifetime of the session. More precisely it should be available during any subsequent handshakes. If no hostname is provided,  no  hostname
       verification will be performed. For a more advanced verification function check gnutls_session_set_verify_cert2().

       If  flags is provided which contain a profile, this function should be called after any session priority setting functions.

       The gnutls_session_set_verify_cert() function is intended to be used by TLS clients to verify the server's certificate.

SINCE
       3.4.6
