NAME
       gnutls_server_name_set - API function

SYNOPSIS
       #include <gnutls/gnutls.h>

       int gnutls_server_name_set(gnutls_session_t session, gnutls_server_name_type_t type, const void * name, size_t name_length);

ARGUMENTS
       gnutls_session_t session
                   is a gnutls_session_t type.

       gnutls_server_name_type_t type
                   specifies the indicator type

       const void * name
                   is a string that contains the server name.

       size_t name_length
                   holds the length of name excluding the terminating null byte

DESCRIPTION
       This  function  is to be used by clients that want to inform (via a TLS extension mechanism) the server of the name they connected to.  This should be used by clients that connect to servers that
       do virtual hosting.

       The value of  name depends on the  type type.  In case of GNUTLS_NAME_DNS, a UTF-8 null-terminated domain name string, without the trailing dot, is expected.

       IPv4 or IPv6 addresses are not permitted to be set by this function.  If the function is called with a name of  name_length zero it will clear all server names set.

RETURNS
       On success, GNUTLS_E_SUCCESS (0) is returned, otherwise a negative error code is returned.
