NAME
       XcupGetReservedColormapEntries - list colormap entries reserved by the system

SYNOPSIS
       cc [ flag ... ] file ... -lXext [ library ... ]
       #include <X11/extensions/Xcup.h>

       Status XcupGetReservedColormapEntries(Display *display,
              int screen, XColor **colors_out, int *ncolors);

ARGUMENTS
       display   Specifies the connection to the X server.

       screen    Screen number on the host server.

       colors_out
                 Returns the values reserved by the server.

       ncolors   Returns the number of items in colors_out.

DESCRIPTION
       The  XcupGetReservedColormapEntries  function  returns  a  list  of colormap entries (pixels) that are reserved by the system. This list will, at a minimum, contain entries for the BlackPixel and
       WhitePixel of the specified screen. Use XFree to free colors_out.

       To minimize colormap flash, an application which installs its own private colormap should query the special colors by calling XCupGetReservedColormapEntries, and can then store those entries  (in
       the proper location) in its private colormap using XCupStoreColors.
