NAME
       xcb_unmap_window - Makes a window invisible

SYNOPSIS
       #include <xcb/xproto.h>

   Request function
       xcb_void_cookie_t xcb_unmap_window(xcb_connection_t *conn, xcb_window_t window);

REQUEST ARGUMENTS
       conn      The XCB connection to X11.

       window    The window to make invisible.

DESCRIPTION
       Unmaps the specified window. This means making the window invisible (and all its child windows).

       Unmapping a window leads to the UnmapNotify event being generated. Also, Expose events are generated for formerly obscured windows.

RETURN VALUE
       Returns an xcb_void_cookie_t. Errors (if any) have to be handled in the event loop.

       If you want to handle errors directly with xcb_request_check instead, use xcb_unmap_window_checked. See xcb-requests(3) for details.

ERRORS
       xcb_window_error_t
                 The specified window does not exist.
