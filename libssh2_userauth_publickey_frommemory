NAME
       libssh2_userauth_publickey_frommemory - authenticate a session with a public key, read from memory

SYNOPSIS
       #include <libssh2.h>

       int libssh2_userauth_publickey_frommemory(LIBSSH2_SESSION *session,
                                                  const char *username,
                                                  size_t username_len,
                                                  const char *publickeydata,
                                                  size_t publickeydata_len,
                                                  const char *privatekeydata,
                                                  size_t privatekeydata_len,
                                                  const char *passphrase);

DESCRIPTION
       This  function allows to authenticate a session with a public key read from memory.  It's only supported when libssh2 is backed by OpenSSL.  session - Session instance as returned by libssh2_ses‚Äê
       sion_init_ex(3)

       username - Remote user name to authenticate as.

       username_len - Length of username.

       publickeydata - Buffer containing the contents of a public key file.

       publickeydata_len - Length of public key data.

       privatekeydata - Buffer containing the contents of a private key file.

       privatekeydata_len - Length of private key data.

       passphrase - Passphrase to use when decoding private key file.

       Attempt public key authentication using a PEM encoded private key file stored in memory.

RETURN VALUE
       Return 0 on success or negative on failure.  It returns LIBSSH2_ERROR_EAGAIN when it would otherwise block. While LIBSSH2_ERROR_EAGAIN is a negative number, it isn't really a failure per se.

ERRORS
       LIBSSH2_ERROR_ALLOC -  An internal memory allocation call failed.

       LIBSSH2_ERROR_SOCKET_SEND - Unable to send data on socket.

       LIBSSH2_ERROR_SOCKET_TIMEOUT -

       LIBSSH2_ERROR_PUBLICKEY_UNVERIFIED - The username/public key combination was invalid.

       LIBSSH2_ERROR_AUTHENTICATION_FAILED - Authentication using the supplied public key was not accepted.

AVAILABILITY
       libssh2_userauth_publickey_frommemory was added in libssh2 1.6.0
