PACLOCK(1)                          paclock                         PACLOCK(1)

NAME
       paclock - lock/unlock the alpm database

SYNOPSIS
        paclock [options]
        paclock (--help|--version)

DESCRIPTION
       Safe locking and unlocking of the ALPM database using identity keys for
       scripts.

OPTIONS
       --config=path
           Set an alternate configuration file path.

       --lockfile=path
           Set an alternate lock file path.

       --root=path
           Set an alternate installation root.

       --sysroot=path
           Set an alternate system root.  See pacutils-sysroot(7).

       --lock
           Lock the database (default).

       --unlock
           Unlock the database.

       --run
           Treat "argv" as a command to run with the database locked.  If the
           command returns non-zero, the lock file will be left in place to
           indicate an error unless --fail-ok is used.

       --fail-ok
           Unlock the database after running a command with --run even if the
           command returns non-zero.  Generally, the database should be left
           locked if it may be in an inconsistent to indicate that it may need
           to be repaired.  This flag is intended primarily for read-only
           operations.

       --print
           Write the lock file path to stdout and exit without modifying the
           lock file.

       --no-check-keys
           Skip checking for an identity key match before unlocking.

       --enoent-ok
           Do not treat a non-existent lock file as an error when unlocking.

       --key=identity
           An identifier to write to the lock file.  By default, --unlock will
           only operate if the lock file was previously locked with the same
           key.  Defaults to the hostname followed by a colon and the process
           id of the caller (for example: "localhost:123").

       --help
           Display usage information and exit.

       --version
           Display version information and exit.

EXAMPLE
       The system configuration that paclock relies on to construct the
       default lock file path and identity key may change between invocations.
       To ensure consistency, scripts should explicitly provide the path and
       key to use each time paclock is called.

        #!/bin/bash
        lock_file="$(paclock --print)"
        lock_key="myapp:$(hostname):$$"
        paclock --lockfile="$lock_file" --key="$lock_key" || exit 1
        echo "do stuff here"
        paclock --lockfile="$lock_file" --key="$lock_key" --unlock || exit 1

       Run a command lacking native lock support:

        paclock --run -- paccache --dryrun --verbose
