       This  manual  page is part of the POSIX Programmer's Manual.  The Linux
       implementation of this interface may differ (consult the  corresponding
       Linux  manual page for details of Linux behavior), or the interface may

NAME
       qhold — hold batch jobs

SYNOPSIS
       qhold [-h hold_list] job_identifier...

DESCRIPTION
       A hold is placed on a batch job by a request to the batch  server  that
       manages  the  batch  job. A batch job that has one or more holds is not
       eligible for execution. The qhold utility is a  user-accessible  client
       of  batch services that requests one or more types of hold to be placed
       on one or more batch jobs.

       The qhold utility shall place holds on those batch  jobs  for  which  a
       batch job_identifier is presented to the utility.

       The qhold utility shall place holds on batch jobs in the order in which
       their batch job_identifiers are presented to the utility. If the  qhold
       utility  fails  to  process  any batch job_identifier successfully, the
       utility shall proceed to process the remaining  batch  job_identifiers,
       if any.

       The qhold utility shall place holds on each batch job by sending a Hold
       Job Request to the batch server that manages the batch job.

       The qhold utility shall not exit until holds have been  placed  on  the
       batch  job corresponding to each successfully processed batch job_iden‐
       tifier.

OPTIONS
       The qhold utility shall conform  to  the  Base  Definitions  volume  of
       POSIX.1‐2017, Section 12.2, Utility Syntax Guidelines.

       The following option shall be supported by the implementation:

       -h hold_list
                 Define the types of holds to be placed on the batch job.

                 The  qhold  -h  option shall accept a value for the hold_list
                 option-argument that is a string of  alphanumeric  characters
                 in  the portable character set (see the Base Definitions vol‐
                 ume of POSIX.1‐2017, Section 6.1, Portable Character Set).

                 The qhold utility shall accept a value for the hold_list  op‐
                 tion-argument  that is a string of one or more of the charac‐
                 ters 'u', 's', or 'o', or the single character 'n'.

                 For each unique character in the  hold_list  option-argument,
                 the  qhold utility shall add a value to the Hold_Types attri‐
                 bute of the batch job as follows, each representing a differ‐
                 ent hold type:

                 u     USER

                 s     SYSTEM

                 o     OPERATOR

                 If  any  of  these characters are duplicated in the hold_list
                 option-argument, the duplicates shall be ignored.

                 An existing Hold_Types attribute can be cleared by  the  fol‐
                 lowing hold type:

                 n     NO_HOLD

                 The qhold utility shall consider it an error if any hold type
                 other than 'n' is combined with hold type 'n'.

                 Strictly conforming applications shall not repeat any of  the
                 characters 'u', 's', 'o', or 'n' within the hold_list option-
                 argument. The qhold utility shall permit  the  repetition  of
                 characters,  but  shall  not assign additional meaning to the
                 repeated characters.

                 An implementation may define other hold  types.  The  confor‐
                 mance document for an implementation shall describe any addi‐
                 tional hold types, how they are specified, their internal be‐
                 havior, and how they affect the behavior of the utility.

                 If  the  -h option is not presented to the qhold utility, the
                 implementation shall set the Hold_Types attribute to USER.

OPERANDS
       The qhold utility shall accept one or more operands that conform to the
       syntax for a batch job_identifier (see Section 3.3.1, Batch Job Identi‐
       fier).

STDIN
       Not used.

INPUT FILES
       None.

ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
       The following environment  variables  shall  affect  the  execution  of
       qhold:

       LANG      Provide  a  default  value for the internationalization vari‐
                 ables that are unset or null. (See the Base Definitions  vol‐
                 ume  of POSIX.1‐2017, Section 8.2, Internationalization Vari‐
                 ables the precedence of internationalization  variables  used
                 to determine the values of locale categories.)

       LC_ALL    If  set  to  a non-empty string value, override the values of
                 all the other internationalization variables.

       LC_CTYPE  Determine the locale for the interpretation of  sequences  of
                 bytes of text data as characters (for example, single-byte as
                 opposed to multi-byte characters in arguments).

       LC_MESSAGES
                 Determine the locale that should be used to affect the format
                 and  contents  of diagnostic messages written to standard er‐
                 ror.

       LOGNAME   Determine the login name of the user.

ASYNCHRONOUS EVENTS
       Default.

STDOUT
       None.

STDERR
       The standard error shall be used only for diagnostic messages.

OUTPUT FILES
       None.

EXTENDED DESCRIPTION
       None.

EXIT STATUS
       The following exit values shall be returned:

        0    Successful completion.

       >0    An error occurred.

CONSEQUENCES OF ERRORS
       In addition to the default behavior, the qhold utility shall not be re‐
       quired  to  write a diagnostic message to standard error when the error
       reply received from a batch server indicates that the batch job_identi‐
       fier  does  not  exist  on the server. Whether or not the qhold utility
       waits to output the diagnostic message while attempting to  locate  the
       job on other servers is implementation-defined.

       The following sections are informative.

APPLICATION USAGE
       None.

EXAMPLES
       None.

RATIONALE
       The  qhold  utility allows users to place a hold on one or more jobs. A
       hold makes a batch job ineligible for execution.

       The qhold utility has options that allow the user to specify  the  type
       of  hold.   Should  the user wish to place a hold on a set of jobs that
       meet a selection criteria, such a list of jobs can  be  acquired  using
       the qselect utility.

       The -h option allows the user to specify the type of hold that is to be
       placed on the job. This option allows for USER, SYSTEM,  OPERATOR,  and
       implementation-defined hold types. The USER and OPERATOR holds are dis‐
       tinct. The batch server that manages the batch job will verify that the
       user is authorized to set the specified hold for the batch job.

       Mail  is  not  required on hold because the administrator has the tools
       and libraries to build this option if he or she wishes.

       Historically, the qhold utility has been a part of some existing  batch
       systems, although it has not traditionally been a part of the NQS.

FUTURE DIRECTIONS
       The qhold utility may be removed in a future version.
