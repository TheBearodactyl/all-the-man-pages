putenv(3)                  Library Functions Manual                  putenv(3)

NAME
       putenv - change or add an environment variable

LIBRARY
       Standard C library (libc, -lc)

SYNOPSIS
       #include <stdlib.h>

       int putenv(char *string);

   Feature Test Macro Requirements for glibc (see feature_test_macros(7)):

       putenv():
           _XOPEN_SOURCE
               || /* glibc >= 2.19: */ _DEFAULT_SOURCE
               || /* glibc <= 2.19: */ _SVID_SOURCE

DESCRIPTION
       The  putenv()  function  adds or changes the value of environment vari‐
       ables.  The argument string is of the form name=value.   If  name  does
       not already exist in the environment, then string is added to the envi‐
       ronment.  If name does exist, then the value of name in the environment
       is  changed  to value.  The string pointed to by string becomes part of
       the environment, so altering the string changes the environment.

RETURN VALUE
       The putenv() function returns zero on success.  On failure, it  returns
       a nonzero value, and errno is set to indicate the error.

ERRORS
       ENOMEM Insufficient space to allocate new environment.

STANDARDS
       POSIX.1-2008.

HISTORY
       POSIX.1-2001, SVr4, 4.3BSD.

       The putenv() function is not required to be reentrant, and the  one  in
       glibc 2.0 is not, but the glibc 2.1 version is.

       Since  glibc  2.1.2,  the  glibc  implementation conforms to SUSv2: the
       pointer string given to putenv() is used.  In particular,  this  string
       becomes  part of the environment; changing it later will change the en‐
       vironment.  (Thus, it is an error to call putenv()  with  an  automatic
       variable  as  the argument, then return from the calling function while
       string is still part of the environment.)  However, from glibc  2.0  to
       glibc  2.1.1,  it  differs:r  a copy of the string is used.  On the one
       hand this causes a memory leak, and  on  the  other  hand  it  violates
       SUSv2.

       The 4.4BSD version, like glibc 2.0, uses a copy.

       SUSv2 removes the const from the prototype, and so does glibc 2.1.3.

       The  GNU C library implementation provides a nonstandard extension.  If
       string does not include an equal sign:

           putenv("NAME");

       then the named variable is removed from the caller's environment.

       This  manual  page is part of the POSIX Programmer's Manual.  The Linux
       implementation of this interface may differ (consult the  corresponding
       Linux  manual page for details of Linux behavior), or the interface may
       not be implemented on Linux.

NAME
       putenv — change or add a value to an environment

SYNOPSIS
       #include <stdlib.h>

       int putenv(char *string);

DESCRIPTION
       The putenv() function shall use the string argument to set  environment
       variable  values.  The  string argument should point to a string of the
       form "name=value".  The putenv() function shall make the value  of  the
       environment  variable name equal to value by altering an existing vari‐
       able or creating a new one. In either case, the string  pointed  to  by
       string  shall  become  part  of the environment, so altering the string
       shall change the environment.

       The putenv() function need not be thread-safe.

RETURN VALUE
       Upon successful completion, putenv()  shall  return  0;  otherwise,  it
       shall return a non-zero value and set errno to indicate the error.

ERRORS
       The putenv() function may fail if:

       ENOMEM Insufficient memory was available.

       The following sections are informative.

EXAMPLES
   Changing the Value of an Environment Variable
       The  following  example changes the value of the HOME environment vari‐
       able to the value /usr/home.

           #include <stdlib.h>
           ...
           static char *var = "HOME=/usr/home";
           int ret;

           ret = putenv(var);

APPLICATION USAGE
       The putenv() function manipulates the environment pointed to  by  envi‐
       ron, and can be used in conjunction with getenv().

       See  exec()  for  restrictions  on  changing  the environment in multi-
       threaded applications.

       This routine may use malloc() to enlarge the environment.

       A potential error is to call putenv() with an automatic variable as the
       argument,  then  return from the calling function while string is still
       part of the environment.

       Although the space used by string is no longer used once a  new  string
       which defines name is passed to putenv(), if any thread in the applica‐
       tion has used getenv() to retrieve  a  pointer  to  this  variable,  it
       should  not  be  freed  by  calling free().  If the changed environment
       variable is one known by the system (such  as  the  locale  environment
       variables) the application should never free the buffer used by earlier
       calls to putenv() for the same variable.

       The setenv() function is preferred over this function.  One  reason  is
       that  putenv() is optional and therefore less portable. Another is that
       using putenv() can slow down environment searches, as explained in  the
       RATIONALE section for getenv().

RATIONALE
       Refer to the RATIONALE section in setenv().

FUTURE DIRECTIONS
       None.
