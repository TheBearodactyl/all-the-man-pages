NAME
       capng_print_caps_text - print names of values for capabilities set

SYNOPSIS
       #include <cap-ng.h>

       char *capng_print_caps_text(capng_print_t where, capng_type_t which);

DESCRIPTION
       capng_print_caps_text  will create a text string representation of the internal capability set specified. The representation can be sent to either stdout or a buffer by passing CAPNG_PRINT_STDOUT
       or CAPNG_PRINT_BUFFER respectively for the where parameter. If the option was for a buffer, this function will malloc a buffer that the caller must free.

       The legal values for the which paramemeter is CAPNG_EFFECTIVE, CAPNG_PERMITTED, CAPNG_INHERITABLE, CAPNG_BOUNDING_SET, or CAPNG_AMBIENT.

RETURN VALUE
       If CAPNG_PRINT_BUFFER was selected for where, this will be the text buffer and NULL on failure. If CAPNG_PRINT_STDOUT was selected then this value will be NULL no matter what.
