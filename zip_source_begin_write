NAME
     zip_source_begin_write, zip_source_begin_write_cloning â€” prepare zip source for writing

LIBRARY
     libzip (-lzip)

SYNOPSIS
     #include <zip.h>

     int
     zip_source_begin_write(zip_source_t *source);

     int
     zip_source_begin_write_cloning(zip_source_t *source, zip_uint64_t offset);

DESCRIPTION
     The functions zip_source_begin_write() and zip_source_begin_write_cloning() prepare source for writing.  Usually this involves creating temporary files or allocating buffers.

     zip_source_begin_write_cloning() preserves the first offset bytes of the original file.  This is done efficiently, and writes to source won't overwrite the original data until zip_commit_write() is
     called.

RETURN VALUES
     Upon successful completion 0 is returned.  Otherwise, -1 is returned and the error information in source is set to indicate the error.

HISTORY
     zip_source_begin_write() was added in libzip 1.0.

     zip_source_begin_write_cloning() was added in libzip 1.4.0.
