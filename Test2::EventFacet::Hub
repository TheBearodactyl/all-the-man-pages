NAME
       Test2::EventFacet::Hub - Facet for the hubs an event passes through.

           The hub class or subclass

       $int = $trace->{pid}
       $int = $trace->pid()
           PID of the hub this event was sent to.

       $int = $trace->{tid}
       $int = $trace->tid()
           The thread ID of the hub the event was sent to.

       $hid = $trace->{hid}
       $hid = $trace->hid()
           The ID of the hub that the event was send to.

       $huuid = $trace->{huuid}
       $huuid = $trace->huuid()
           The UUID of the hub that the event was sent to.

       $int = $trace->{nested}
       $int = $trace->nested()
           How deeply nested the hub was.

       $bool = $trace->{buffered}
