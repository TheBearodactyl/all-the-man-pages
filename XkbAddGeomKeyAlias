NAME
       XkbAddGeomKeyAlias - Add one key alias to an existing keyboard geometry description

SYNOPSIS
       XkbKeyAliasPtr XkbAddGeomKeyAlias (XkbGeometryPtr geom, _Xconst char *alias, _Xconst char *real);

ARGUMENTS
       geom   geometry to be updated

       alias  alias to be added

       real   real name to be bound to the new alias

DESCRIPTION
       Xkb  provides  functions  to add a single new element to the top-level keyboard geometry. In each case the num_ * fields of the corresponding structure is incremented by 1. These functions do not
       change sz_* unless there is no more room in the array. Some of these functions fill in the values of the element's structure from the arguments. For other functions,  you  must  explicitly  write
       code to fill the structure's elements.

       The top-level geometry description includes a list of geometry properties.  A geometry property associates an arbitrary string with an equally arbitrary name. Programs that display images of key‚Äê
       boards can use geometry properties as hints, but they are not interpreted by Xkb. No other geometry structures refer to geometry properties.

       XkbAddGeomKeyAlias adds one key alias with the value alias to the geometry geom, and associates it with the key whose real name is real. XkbAddGeomKeyAlias returns NULL if any of  the  parameters
       is empty or if it was not able to allocate space for the alias. To allocate space for an arbitrary number of aliases, use the XkbAllocGeomKeyAliases function.

STRUCTURES
           typedef struct {
               char            real[XkbKeyNameLength];   /* this key name must be in the keys array */
               char            alias[XkbKeyNameLength];  /* symbolic key name as alias for the key */
           } XkbKeyAliasRec,*XkbKeyAliasPtr;
