SD_BUS_SET_METHOD_CALL_Tsd_bus_set_method_calSD_BUS_SET_METHOD_CALL_TIMEOUT(3)

NAME
       sd_bus_set_method_call_timeout, sd_bus_get_method_call_timeout - Set or
       query the default D-Bus method call timeout of a bus object

SYNOPSIS
       #include <systemd/sd-bus.h>

       int sd_bus_set_method_call_timeout(sd_bus *bus, uint64_t usec);

       int sd_bus_get_method_call_timeout(sd_bus *bus, uint64_t *ret);

DESCRIPTION
       sd_bus_set_method_call_timeout() sets the default D-Bus method call
       timeout of bus to usec microseconds.

       sd_bus_get_method_call_timeout() queries the default D-Bus method call
       timeout of bus. If no method call timeout was set using
       sd_bus_set_method_call_timeout(), the timeout is read from the
       $SYSTEMD_BUS_TIMEOUT environment variable. If this environment variable
       is unset or does not contain a valid timeout, the implementation falls
       back to a predefined method call timeout of 25 seconds. Note that
       $SYSTEMD_BUS_TIMEOUT is read once and cached so callers should not rely
       on being able to change the default method call timeout at runtime by
       changing the value of $SYSTEMD_BUS_TIMEOUT. Instead, call
       sd_bus_set_method_call_timeout() to change the default method call
       timeout.

RETURN VALUE
       On success, these functions return a non-negative integer. On failure,
       they return a negative errno-style error code.

   Errors
       Returned errors may indicate the following problems:

       -EINVAL
           The parameters bus or ret are NULL.

       -ENOPKG
           Bus object bus could not be resolved.

NOTES
       These APIs are implemented as a shared library, which can be compiled
       and linked to with the libsystemd pkg-config(1) file.
