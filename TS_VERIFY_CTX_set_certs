NAME
       TS_VERIFY_CTX_set_certs, TS_VERIFY_CTS_set_certs - set certificates for TS response verification

SYNOPSIS
        #include <openssl/ts.h>

        STACK_OF(X509) *TS_VERIFY_CTX_set_certs(TS_VERIFY_CTX *ctx,
                                                STACK_OF(X509) *certs);
        STACK_OF(X509) *TS_VERIFY_CTS_set_certs(TS_VERIFY_CTX *ctx,
                                                STACK_OF(X509) *certs);

DESCRIPTION
       The Time-Stamp Protocol (TSP) is defined by RFC 3161. TSP is a protocol used to provide long term proof of the existence of a certain datum before a particular time. TSP defines a Time Stamping
       Authority (TSA) and an entity who shall make requests to the TSA. Usually the TSA is denoted as the server side and the requesting entity is denoted as the client.

       In TSP, when a server is sending a response to a client, the server normally needs to sign the response data - the TimeStampToken (TST) - with its private key. Then the client shall verify the
       received TST by the server's certificate chain.

       TS_VERIFY_CTX_set_certs() is used to set the server's certificate chain when verifying a TST. ctx is the verification context created in advance and certs is a stack of X509 certificates.

       TS_VERIFY_CTS_set_certs() is a misspelled version of TS_VERIFY_CTX_set_certs() which takes the same parameters and returns the same result.

RETURN VALUES
       TS_VERIFY_CTX_set_certs() returns the stack of X509 certificates the user passes in via parameter certs.

HISTORY
       The spelling of TS_VERIFY_CTX_set_certs() was corrected in OpenSSL 3.0.0.  The misspelled version TS_VERIFY_CTS_set_certs() has been retained for compatibility reasons, but it is deprecated in
       OpenSSL 3.0.0.
