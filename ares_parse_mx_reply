NAME
       ares_parse_mx_reply - Parse a reply to a DNS query of type MX

SYNOPSIS
       #include <ares.h>

       int ares_parse_mx_reply(const unsigned char* abuf, int alen,
                               struct ares_mx_reply** mx_out);

DESCRIPTION
       The  ares_parse_mx_reply  function parses the response to a query of type MX into a linked list of struct ares_mx_reply The parameters abuf and alen give the contents of the response.  The result
       is stored in allocated memory and a pointer to it stored into the variable pointed to by mx_out.  It is the caller's responsibility to free the resulting mx_out structure when  it  is  no  longer
       needed using the function ares_free_data

       The structure ares_mx_reply contains the following fields:

           struct ares_mx_reply {
               struct ares_mx_reply *next;
               char *host;
               unsigned short priority;
           };

RETURN VALUES
       ares_parse_mx_reply can return any of the following values:

       ARES_SUCCESS   The response was successfully parsed.

       ARES_EBADRESP  The response was malformatted.

       ARES_ENODATA   The response did not contain an answer to the query.

       ARES_ENOMEM    Memory was exhausted.
