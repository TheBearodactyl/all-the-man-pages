NAME
       XkbAllocGeomOverlayKeys - Allocate keys in an overlay row

SYNOPSIS
       Status XkbAllocGeomOverlayKeys (XkbOverlayRowPtr row, int num_needed);

ARGUMENTS
       row    section for which rows should be allocated

       num_needed
              number of new rows required

DESCRIPTION
       Xkb  provides  a number of functions to allocate and free subcomponents of a keyboard geometry. Use these functions to create or modify keyboard geometries. Note that these functions merely allo‚Äê
       cate space for the new element(s), and it is up to you to fill in the values explicitly in your code. These allocation functions increase sz_* but never touch num_* (unless there is an allocation
       failure,  in which case they reset both sz_* and num_* to zero). These functions return Success if they succeed, BadAlloc if they are not able to allocate space, or BadValue if a parameter is not
       as expected.

       XkbAllocGeomOverlayKeys allocates num_needed keys and adds them to the row.  No initialization of the keys is done.

DIAGNOSTICS
       BadAlloc       Unable to allocate storage

       BadValue       An argument is out of range
