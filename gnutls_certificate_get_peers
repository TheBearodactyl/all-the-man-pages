NAME
       gnutls_certificate_get_peers - API function

SYNOPSIS
       #include <gnutls/gnutls.h>

       const gnutls_datum_t * gnutls_certificate_get_peers(gnutls_session_t          session, unsigned int * list_size);

ARGUMENTS
       gnutls_session_t          session
                   is a gnutls session

       unsigned int * list_size
                   is the length of the certificate list (may be NULL)

DESCRIPTION
       Get the peer's raw certificate (chain) as sent by the peer.  These certificates are in raw format (DER encoded for X.509).  In case of a X.509 then a certificate list may be present.  The list is
       provided as sent by the server; the server must send as first certificate in the list its own certificate, following the issuer's certificate, then the issuer's issuer  etc.  However,  there  are
       servers which violate this principle and thus on certain occasions this may be an unsorted list.

       In resumed sessions, this function will return the peer's certificate list as used in the first/original session.

RETURNS
       a pointer to a gnutls_datum_t containing the peer's certificates, or NULL in case of an error or if no certificate was used.
