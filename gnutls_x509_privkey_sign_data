NAME
       gnutls_x509_privkey_sign_data - API function

SYNOPSIS
       #include <gnutls/x509.h>

       int gnutls_x509_privkey_sign_data(gnutls_x509_privkey_t key, gnutls_digest_algorithm_t digest, unsigned int flags, const gnutls_datum_t * data, void * signature, size_t * signature_size);

ARGUMENTS
       gnutls_x509_privkey_t key
                   a key

       gnutls_digest_algorithm_t digest
                   should be a digest algorithm

       unsigned int flags
                   should be 0 for now

       const gnutls_datum_t * data
                   holds the data to be signed

       void * signature
                   will contain the signature

       size_t * signature_size
                   holds the size of signature (and will be replaced by the new size)

DESCRIPTION
       This function will sign the given data using a signature algorithm supported by the private key. Signature algorithms are always used together with a hash functions.  Different hash functions may
       be used for the RSA algorithm, but only SHA-1 for the DSA keys.

       If the buffer provided is not long enough to hold the output, then * signature_size is updated and GNUTLS_E_SHORT_MEMORY_BUFFER will be returned.

       Use gnutls_x509_crt_get_preferred_hash_algorithm() to determine the hash algorithm.

RETURNS
       On success, GNUTLS_E_SUCCESS (0) is returned, otherwise a negative error value.
