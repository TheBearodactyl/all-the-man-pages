NAME
       gnutls_hash_copy - API function

SYNOPSIS
       #include <gnutls/crypto.h>

       gnutls_hash_hd_t gnutls_hash_copy(gnutls_hash_hd_t handle);

ARGUMENTS
       gnutls_hash_hd_t handle
                   is a gnutls_hash_hd_t type

DESCRIPTION
       This  function  will  create  a copy of Message Digest context, containing all its current state. Copying contexts for Message Digests registered using gnutls_crypto_register_digest() is not sup‐
       ported and will always result in an error. In addition to that, some of the Message Digest implementations do not support this operation. Applications should check the return value and provide  a
       proper fallback.

RETURNS
       new Message Digest context or NULL in case of an error.

SINCE
       3.6.9
