NAME
       wcsncpy - copy a fixed-size string of wide characters

LIBRARY
       Standard C library (libc, -lc)

SYNOPSIS
       #include <wchar.h>

       wchar_t *wcsncpy(wchar_t dest[restrict .n],
                        const wchar_t src[restrict .n],
                        size_t n);

DESCRIPTION
       The  wcsncpy() function is the wide-character equivalent of the strncpy(3) function.  It copies at most n wide characters from the wide-character string pointed to by src, including the terminat‐
       ing null wide character (L'\0'), to the array pointed to by dest.  Exactly n wide characters are written at dest.  If the length wcslen(src) is smaller than n, the remaining  wide  characters  in
       the  array  pointed  to by dest are filled with null wide characters.  If the length wcslen(src) is greater than or equal to n, the string pointed to by dest will not be terminated by a null wide
       character.

       The strings may not overlap.

       The programmer must ensure that there is room for at least n wide characters at dest.

RETURN VALUE
       wcsncpy() returns dest.

PROLOG
       This  manual  page is part of the POSIX Programmer's Manual.  The Linux implementation of this interface may differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for details of Linux behavior), or
       the interface may not be implemented on Linux.

NAME
       wcpncpy, wcsncpy — copy a fixed-size wide-character string, returning a pointer to its end

SYNOPSIS
       #include <wchar.h>

       wchar_t *wcpncpy(wchar_t restrict *ws1, const wchar_t *restrict ws2,
           size_t n);
       wchar_t *wcsncpy(wchar_t *restrict ws1, const wchar_t *restrict ws2,
           size_t n);

DESCRIPTION
       For wcsncpy(): The functionality described on this reference page is aligned with the ISO C standard. Any conflict between the requirements described here and the ISO C standard is unintentional.
       This volume of POSIX.1‐2017 defers to the ISO C standard.

       The wcpncpy() and wcsncpy() functions shall copy not more than n wide-character codes (wide-character codes that follow a null wide-character code are not copied) from the array pointed to by ws2
       to the array pointed to by ws1.  If copying takes place between objects that overlap, the behavior is undefined.

       If the array pointed to by ws2 is a wide-character string that is shorter than n wide-character codes, null wide-character codes shall be appended to the copy in the array pointed to by ws1,  un‐
       til n wide-character codes in all are written.

RETURN VALUE
       If any null wide-character codes were written into the destination, the wcpncpy() function shall return the address of the first such null wide-character code. Otherwise, it shall return &ws1[n].

       The wcsncpy() function shall return ws1.

       No return values are reserved to indicate an error.

ERRORS
       No errors are defined.

       The following sections are informative.

EXAMPLES
       None.

APPLICATION USAGE
       If there is no null wide-character code in the first n wide-character codes of the array pointed to by ws2, the result is not null-terminated.

RATIONALE
       None.

FUTURE DIRECTIONS
       None.
