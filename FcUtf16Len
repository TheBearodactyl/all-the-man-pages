NAME
       FcUtf16Len - count UTF-16 encoded chars

SYNOPSIS
       #include <fontconfig/fontconfig.h>

       FcBool FcUtf16Len (FcChar8 *src, FcEndian endian, int len, int *nchar, int *wchar);

DESCRIPTION
       Counts  the  number of Unicode chars in len bytes of src.  Bytes of src are combined into 16-bit units according to endian.  Places that count in nchar.  wchar contains 1, 2 or 4 depending on the
       number of bytes needed to hold the largest Unicode char counted.  The return value indicates whether string is a well-formed UTF16 string.
