NAME
       ldns_rr_set_push_rr, ldns_rr_set_pop_rr - push and pop rr on a rrset

SYNOPSIS
       #include <stdint.h>
       #include <stdbool.h>

       #include <ldns/ldns.h>

       bool ldns_rr_set_push_rr(ldns_rr_list *rr_list, ldns_rr *rr);

       ldns_rr* ldns_rr_set_pop_rr(ldns_rr_list *rr_list);

DESCRIPTION
       ldns_rr_set_push_rr() pushes an rr to an rrset (which really are rr_list's).
              *rr_list: the rrset to push the rr to
              *rr: the rr to push
              Returns true if the push succeeded otherwise false

       ldns_rr_set_pop_rr() pops the last rr from an rrset. This function is there only for the symmetry.
              rr_list: the rr_list to pop from
              Returns NULL if nothing to pop. Otherwise the popped RR
