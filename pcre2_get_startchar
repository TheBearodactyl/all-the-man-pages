PCRE2_GET_STARTCHAR(3)     Library Functions Manual     PCRE2_GET_STARTCHAR(3)

NAME
       PCRE2 - Perl-compatible regular expressions (revised API)

SYNOPSIS

       #include <pcre2.h>

       PCRE2_SIZE pcre2_get_startchar(pcre2_match_data *match_data);

DESCRIPTION

       After  a  successful  call  of  pcre2_match() that was passed the match
       block that is this function's argument, this function returns the  code
       unit offset of the character at which the successful match started. For
       a non-partial match, this can be different to the value  of  ovector[0]
       if  the pattern contains the \K escape sequence. After a partial match,
       however, this value is always the same as ovector[0]  because  \K  does
       not affect the result of a partial match.

       There is a complete description of the PCRE2 native API in the pcre2api
       page and a description of the POSIX API in the pcre2posix page.
