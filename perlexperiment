NAME
       perlexperiment - A listing of experimental features in Perl

DESCRIPTION
       This document lists the current and past experimental features in the
       perl core. Although all of these are documented with their appropriate
       topics, this succinct listing gives you an overview and basic facts
       about their status.

       So far we've merely tried to find and list the experimental features
       and infer their inception, versions, etc. There's a lot of speculation
       here.

   Current experiments
       Smart match ("~~")
               Introduced in Perl 5.10.0

               Modified in Perl 5.10.1, 5.12.0

               Using this feature triggers warnings in the category
               "experimental::smartmatch".

               The ticket for this experiment is [perl #13173]
               <https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/13173>.

       Aliasing via reference
               Introduced in Perl 5.22.0

       Declaring a reference to a variable
               Introduced in Perl 5.26.0

               Variability of up to 255 characters is handled.

               Using this feature triggers warnings in the category

               The ticket for this experiment is [perl #18756]
               <https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/18756>.

               See also: "(*positive_lookbehind:pattern)" in perlre and
               "(*negative_lookbehind:pattern)" in perlre

       Unicode private use character hooks
               Introduced in Perl 5.30.0.

               This feature is part of an interface intended for internal and
               experimental use by the perl5 developers.  You are unlikely to
               encounter it in the wild.

               Using this feature triggers warnings in the category
               "experimental::private_use".

               The ticket for this experiment is [perl #18758]
               <https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/18758>.

       Unicode property wildcards
               Introduced in Perl 5.30.0.

               This feature allows regular expression matching against Unicode
               character properties to be expressed more concisely.

               Using this feature triggers warnings in the category
               "experimental::uniprop_wildcards".

               The ticket for this experiment is [perl #18759]
               <https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/18759>.

       try/catch control structure
               Introduced in Perl 5.34.0.

               Using this feature triggers warnings in the category
               "experimental::try".

               The ticket for this experiment is [perl #18760]
               <https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/18760>

       Use of @_ within subroutine signatures
               Introduced in Perl 5.36.0 as part of a reduction in the scope
               of experimental subroutine signatures.

               Using the default arguments array (@_) within a subroutine that
               uses signatures will emit a warning in the category
               "experimental::args_array_with_signatures". This includes @_
               directly, elements of it such as $_[$index], or situations
               where the default arguments array is accessed implicitly such
               as "shift" or "pop" without arguments.

       for loop with multiple iteration variables
               Introduced in Perl 5.36.0.

               Using this feature triggers warnings in the category
               "experimental::for_list".

               This feature enables a parenthesized list of iteration
               variables for "for" rather than a single variable.

               The ticket for this experiment is [perl #18744]
               <https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/18744>.

       The builtin namespace
               Introduced in Perl 5.36.0.

               Using this feature triggers warnings in the category
               "experimental::builtin".

               In Perl 5.36.0, a new namespace, "builtin", was created for new
               core functions that will not be present in every namespace, but
               will be available for importing.  The namespace itself is
               considered an experiment.  Specific functions within it may
               also be experimental.

               The ticket for this experiment is [perl #19764]
               <https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/19764>.

       The defer block modifier
               Introduced in Perl 5.36.0

               Using this feature triggers warnings in the category
               "builtin::defer".

               This feature adds a new kind of block, a "defer" block, which
               will not be executed until the containing block is being
               exited.

               The ticket for this experiment is [perl #17949]
               <https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/17949>.

       Extra paired delimiters for quote-like operators
               Introduced in Perl 5.36.0

               Using this feature triggers warnings in the category
               "builtin::extra_paired_delimiters".

               This feature allows for many non-ASCII pairs of mirroring
               delimiters, for example:

                   my @array = qwX tinker tailer soldier spy X;

               The ticket for this experiment is [perl #19765]
               <https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/19765>.

   Accepted features
       These features were so wildly successful and played so well with others
       that we decided to remove their experimental status and admit them as
       full, stable features in the world of Perl, lavishing all the benefits
       and luxuries thereof.  They are also awarded +5 Stability and +3
       Charisma.

   Removed features
       These features are no longer considered experimental and their
       functionality has disappeared. It's your own fault if you wrote
       production programs using these features after we explicitly told you
       not to (see perlpolicy).
