NAME
       gnutls_pcert_list_import_x509_raw - API function

SYNOPSIS
       #include <gnutls/abstract.h>

       int gnutls_pcert_list_import_x509_raw(gnutls_pcert_st * pcert_list, unsigned int * pcert_list_size, const gnutls_datum_t * data, gnutls_x509_crt_fmt_t format, unsigned int flags);

ARGUMENTS
       gnutls_pcert_st * pcert_list
                   The structures to store the certificates; must not contain initialized gnutls_pcert_st structures.

       unsigned int * pcert_list_size
                   Initially must hold the maximum number of certs. It will be updated with the number of certs available.

       const gnutls_datum_t * data
                   The certificates.

       gnutls_x509_crt_fmt_t format
                   One of DER or PEM.

       unsigned int flags
                   must be (0) or an OR'd sequence of gnutls_certificate_import_flags.

DESCRIPTION
       This  function  will  import  the  provided  DER  or  PEM  encoded  certificates  to  an already allocated set of gnutls_pcert_st structures. The structures must be deinitialized afterwards using
       gnutls_pcert_deinit().  pcert_list should contain space for at least  pcert_list_size elements.

       If the Certificate is PEM encoded it should have a header of "X509 CERTIFICATE", or "CERTIFICATE".

RETURNS
       On success, GNUTLS_E_SUCCESS (0) is returned, otherwise a negative error value; if the  pcert list doesn't have enough space GNUTLS_E_SHORT_MEMORY_BUFFER will be returned.

SINCE
       3.0
