NAME
       gnutls_certificate_set_x509_key_file - API function

SYNOPSIS
       #include <gnutls/gnutls.h>

       int gnutls_certificate_set_x509_key_file(gnutls_certificate_credentials_t res, const char * certfile, const char * keyfile, gnutls_x509_crt_fmt_t type);

ARGUMENTS
       gnutls_certificate_credentials_t res
                   is a gnutls_certificate_credentials_t type.

       const char * certfile
                   is a file that containing the certificate list (path) for the specified private key, in PKCS7 format, or a list of certificates

       const char * keyfile
                   is a file that contains the private key

       gnutls_x509_crt_fmt_t type
                   is PEM or DER

DESCRIPTION
       This  function  sets  a  certificate/private  key  pair in the gnutls_certificate_credentials_t type.  This function may be called more than once, in case multiple keys/certificates exist for the
       server.  For clients that need to send more than its own end entity certificate, e.g., also an intermediate CA cert, then the
        certfile must contain the ordered certificate chain.

       Note that the names in the certificate provided will be considered when selecting the appropriate certificate to use (in case of multiple certificate/key pairs).

       This function can also accept URLs at  keyfile and  certfile . In that case it will use the private key and certificate indicated by the URLs. Note that the supported URLs are the ones  indicated
       by gnutls_url_is_supported().

       In case the  certfile is provided as a PKCS 11 URL, then the certificate, and its present issuers in the token are imported (i.e., forming the required trust chain).

       If that function fails to load the  res structure is at an undefined state, it must not be reused to load other keys or certificates.

       Note that, this function by default returns zero on success and a negative value on error.  Since 3.5.6, when the flag GNUTLS_CERTIFICATE_API_V2 is set using gnutls_certificate_set_flags() it re‐
       turns an index (greater or equal to zero). That index can be used to other functions to refer to the added key-pair.

RETURNS
       On success this functions returns zero, and otherwise a negative value on error (see above for modifying that behavior).

       3.1.11
