NAME
       gnutls_hash_init - API function

SYNOPSIS
       #include <gnutls/crypto.h>

       int gnutls_hash_init(gnutls_hash_hd_t * dig, gnutls_digest_algorithm_t algorithm);

ARGUMENTS
       gnutls_hash_hd_t * dig
                   is a gnutls_hash_hd_t type

       gnutls_digest_algorithm_t algorithm
                   the hash algorithm to use

DESCRIPTION
       This function will initialize an context that can be used to produce a Message Digest of data.  This will effectively use the current crypto backend in use by gnutls or the cryptographic acceler‐
       ator in use.

RETURNS
       Zero or a negative error code on error.

SINCE
       2.10.0
