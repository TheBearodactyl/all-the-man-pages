NAME
       libinput-list-kernel-devices - list all kernel input devices

SYNOPSIS
       libinput list-kernel-devices [--help]

DESCRIPTION
       The libinput list-kernel-devices tool iterates through the list of available kernel devices and prints their device node and device name. By default this tool lists evdev event nodes.

OPTIONS
       --help  Print help

       --hid   List HID devices instead of evdev device nodes

NOTES
       A device may be available but not recognized by libinput. This may indicate a bug with the udev configuration. See the libinput list-devices tools for the devices recognized by libinput.
