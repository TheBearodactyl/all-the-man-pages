NAME
       gnutls_ocsp_status_request_enable_client - API function

SYNOPSIS
       #include <gnutls/gnutls.h>

       int gnutls_ocsp_status_request_enable_client(gnutls_session_t session, gnutls_datum_t * responder_id, size_t responder_id_size, gnutls_datum_t * extensions);

ARGUMENTS
       gnutls_session_t session
                   is a gnutls_session_t type.

       gnutls_datum_t * responder_id
                   ignored, must be NULL

       size_t responder_id_size
                   ignored, must be zero

       gnutls_datum_t * extensions
                   ignored, must be NULL

DESCRIPTION
       This function is to be used by clients to request OCSP response from the server, using the "status_request" TLS extension.  Only OCSP status type is supported.

       Previous versions of GnuTLS supported setting  responder_id and
        extensions fields, but due to the difficult semantics of the parameter usage, and other issues, this support was removed since 3.6.0 and these parameters must be set to NULL.

RETURNS
       On success, GNUTLS_E_SUCCESS (0) is returned, otherwise a negative error code is returned.

SINCE
       3.1.3
