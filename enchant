NAME
       Enchant - enchant ordering files and personal word lists

ORDERING FILE
       Enchant uses global and per-user ordering files named enchant.ordering to decide which spelling provider to use for particular languages.  The per-user file takes precedence.

       The  ordering  file takes the form language_tag:<comma-separated list of spelling providers>. The language tag is an IETF BCP 47 language tag, typically of the form COUNTRY_LANGUAGE.  To see what
       dictionaries are available, run enchant-lsmod-2. ‘*’ is used to mean “use this ordering for all languages, unless instructed otherwise.” For example:

              *:aspell,hunspell,nuspell
              en:aspell,hunspell,nuspell
              en_GB:hunspell,nuspell,aspell
              fr:hunspell,nuspell,aspell

PERSONAL WORD LISTS
       Personal word lists are simple plain text files with one word per line.  Lines starting with a hash sign ‘#’ are ignored.

   SHARING PERSONAL WORD LISTS BETWEEN SPELL-CHECKERS
       It is possible, and usually safe, to share Enchant’s personal word lists with other spelling checkers that use the same format (note that other spell-checkers  may  not  support  comments!).  The
       spell-checkers  known to be compatible are Hunspell, Nuspell and Ispell. (Although Enchant does not support Ispell as a back-end, it’s still fine to share word lists with it.)  Other spell-check‐
       ers supported by Enchant are either incompatible, or have no personal word list mechanism. There may well be yet other spell-checkers, unknown to Enchant, that use the same format.

       Some applications use Hunspell or Nuspell, but store the personal word list under another name or in another location. Firefox is one example. Firefox also seems to reorder its word list when up‐
       dating it; again, this is OK, as the result is still in the same format. Anonther example is Thunderbird.

       To  share  word  lists with Enchant, find the other spelling checker’s word list file, e.g. ~/.hunspell_fr_FR or ~/.config/nuspell/fr_FR, and merge it with the corresponding Enchant file, in this
       case ~/.config/enchant/fr_FR.dic. Use the following command, replacing ENCHANT-DICT and OTHER-DICT with the corresponding dictionary file names:

              cat ENCHANT-DICT OTHER-DICT | sort -u > merged.txt

       Take a look at merged.txt to check the merge has worked, then

              mv merged.txt ENCHANT-DICT
              rm OTHER-DICT
              ln -s OTHER-DICT ENCHANT-DICT

       to replace the other dictionary file with a link to the Enchant dictionary, again filling in the name of the dictionary files.

FILES AND DIRECTORIES
       Enchant looks in the following places for files, in decreasing order of precedence:

       ENCHANT_CONFIG_DIR
              (If the environment variable is set.)

       XDG_CONFIG_HOME/enchant (non-Windows systems)
              Default: ~/.config/enchant

       CSIDL_LOCAL_APPDATA\enchant (Windows systems)
              Default: C:\Documents and Settings\username\Local Settings\Application Data\enchant

       DATADIR/enchant
              (Or the equivalent location relative to the enchant library for a relocatable build.)

       Dictionaries are looked for in a subdirectory with the same name as the provider; for example, DATADIR/enchant/hunspell and ~/.config/enchant/hunspell.

       Some providers may also look in a standard system directory for their dictionaries; the hunspell provider can be configured to do so at build time.
