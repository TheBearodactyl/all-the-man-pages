NAME
       libssh2_banner_set - set the SSH protocol banner for the local client

SYNOPSIS
       #include <libssh2.h>

       int libssh2_banner_set(LIBSSH2_SESSION *session, const char *banner);

DESCRIPTION
       This function is DEPRECATED. Use libssh2_session_banner_set(3) instead!

       session - Session instance as returned by libssh2_session_init_ex(3)

       banner - A pointer to a user defined banner

       Set the banner that will be sent to the remote host when the SSH session is started with libssh2_session_handshake(3)
         This is optional; a banner corresponding to the protocol and libssh2 version will be sent by default.

RETURN VALUE
       Return 0 on success or negative on failure.  It returns LIBSSH2_ERROR_EAGAIN when it would otherwise block. While LIBSSH2_ERROR_EAGAIN is a negative number, it isn't really a failure per se.

AVAILABILITY
       Marked as deprecated since 1.4.0

ERRORS
       LIBSSH2_ERROR_ALLOC -  An internal memory allocation call failed.
