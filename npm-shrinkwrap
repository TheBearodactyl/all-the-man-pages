NAME
       npm-shrinkwrap - Lock down dependency versions for publication

   Synopsis
         npm shrinkwrap

       Note: This command is unaware of workspaces.

   Description
       This command repurposes package-lock.json into a publishable npm-shrinkwrap.json or simply creates a new one. The file created and updated by this command will then take precedence over any other
       existing or future package-lock.json files. For a detailed explanation of the design and purpose of package locks in npm, see npm help package-lock-json.
