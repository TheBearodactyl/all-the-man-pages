NAME
       gnutls_crypto_register_aead_cipher - API function

SYNOPSIS
       #include <gnutls/crypto.h>

       int  gnutls_crypto_register_aead_cipher(gnutls_cipher_algorithm_t algorithm, int priority, gnutls_cipher_init_func init, gnutls_cipher_setkey_func setkey, gnutls_cipher_aead_encrypt_func aead_en‐
       crypt, gnutls_cipher_aead_decrypt_func aead_decrypt, gnutls_cipher_deinit_func deinit);

ARGUMENTS
       gnutls_cipher_algorithm_t algorithm
                   is the gnutls AEAD cipher identifier

       int priority
                   is the priority of the algorithm

       gnutls_cipher_init_func init
                   A function which initializes the cipher

       gnutls_cipher_setkey_func setkey
                   A function which sets the key of the cipher

       gnutls_cipher_aead_encrypt_func aead_encrypt
                   Perform the AEAD encryption

       gnutls_cipher_aead_decrypt_func aead_decrypt
                   Perform the AEAD decryption

       gnutls_cipher_deinit_func deinit
                   A function which deinitializes the cipher

DESCRIPTION
       This function will register a cipher algorithm to be used by gnutls.  Any algorithm registered will override the included algorithms and by convention kernel implemented algorithms have  priority
       of 90 and CPU-assisted of 80.  The algorithm with the lowest priority will be used by gnutls.

       In the case the registered init or setkey functions return GNUTLS_E_NEED_FALLBACK, GnuTLS will attempt to use the next in priority registered cipher.

       The functions registered will be used with the new AEAD API introduced in GnuTLS 3.4.0. Internally GnuTLS uses the new AEAD API.

DEPRECATED
       since 3.7.0 it is no longer possible to override cipher implementation

RETURNS
       GNUTLS_E_SUCCESS on success, otherwise a negative error code.

SINCE
       3.4.0
