SSL_CTX_CTRL(3ssl)                  OpenSSL                 SSL_CTX_CTRL(3ssl)

NAME
       SSL_CTX_ctrl, SSL_CTX_callback_ctrl, SSL_ctrl, SSL_callback_ctrl -
       internal handling functions for SSL_CTX and SSL objects

SYNOPSIS
        #include <openssl/ssl.h>

        long SSL_CTX_ctrl(SSL_CTX *ctx, int cmd, long larg, void *parg);
        long SSL_CTX_callback_ctrl(SSL_CTX *, int cmd, void (*fp)());

        long SSL_ctrl(SSL *ssl, int cmd, long larg, void *parg);
        long SSL_callback_ctrl(SSL *, int cmd, void (*fp)());

DESCRIPTION
       The SSL_*_ctrl() family of functions is used to manipulate settings of
       the SSL_CTX and SSL objects. Depending on the command cmd the arguments
       larg, parg, or fp are evaluated. These functions should never be called
       directly. All functionalities needed are made available via other
       functions or macros.

RETURN VALUES
       The return values of the SSL*_ctrl() functions depend on the command
       supplied via the cmd parameter.
