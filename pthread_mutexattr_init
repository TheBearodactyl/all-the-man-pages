pthread_mutexattr_init(3)  Library Functions Manual  pthread_mutexattr_init(3)

NAME
       pthread_mutexattr_init,  pthread_mutexattr_destroy - initialize and de‐
       stroy a mutex attributes object

LIBRARY
       POSIX threads library (libpthread, -lpthread)

SYNOPSIS
       #include <pthread.h>

       int pthread_mutexattr_init(pthread_mutexattr_t *attr);
       int pthread_mutexattr_destroy(pthread_mutexattr_t *attr);

DESCRIPTION
       The pthread_mutexattr_init() function initializes the mutex  attributes
       object  pointed  to  by attr with default values for all attributes de‐
       fined by the implementation.

       The results of initializing an already initialized mutex attributes ob‐
       ject are undefined.

       The pthread_mutexattr_destroy() function destroys a mutex attribute ob‐
       ject (making it uninitialized).  Once a  mutex  attributes  object  has
       been destroyed, it can be reinitialized with pthread_mutexattr_init().

       The  results of destroying an uninitialized mutex attributes object are
       undefined.

RETURN VALUE
       On success, these functions return 0.  On error, they return a positive
       error number.

STANDARDS
       POSIX.1-2008.

HISTORY
       POSIX.1-2001.

NOTES
       Subsequent  changes  to  a  mutex attributes object do not affect mutex
       that have already been initialized using that object.
