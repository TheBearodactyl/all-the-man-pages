NAME
       gnutls_pubkey_import_tpm_url - API function

SYNOPSIS
       #include <gnutls/abstract.h>

       int gnutls_pubkey_import_tpm_url(gnutls_pubkey_t pkey, const char * url, const char * srk_password, unsigned int flags);

ARGUMENTS
       gnutls_pubkey_t pkey
                   The public key

       const char * url
                   The URL of the TPM key to be imported

       const char * srk_password
                   The password for the SRK key (optional)

       unsigned int flags
                   should be zero

DESCRIPTION
       This function will import the given private key to the abstract gnutls_privkey_t type.

       Note  that unless GNUTLS_PUBKEY_DISABLE_CALLBACKS is specified, if incorrect (or NULL) passwords are given the PKCS11 callback functions will be used to obtain the correct passwords. Otherwise if
       the SRK password is wrong GNUTLS_E_TPM_SRK_PASSWORD_ERROR is returned.
