NAME
       libssh2_agent_get_identity - get a public key off the collection of public keys managed by ssh-agent

SYNOPSIS
       #include <libssh2.h>

       int libssh2_agent_get_identity(LIBSSH2_AGENT *agent,
                                      struct libssh2_agent_publickey **store,
                                      struct libssh2_agent_publickey *prev);

DESCRIPTION
       libssh2_agent_get_identity(3) allows an application to iterate over all public keys in the collection managed by ssh-agent.

       store should point to a pointer that gets filled in to point to the public key data.

       prev is a pointer to a previous 'struct libssh2_agent_publickey' as returned by a previous invoke of this function, or NULL to get the first entry in the internal collection.

RETURN VALUE
       Returns 0 if everything is fine and information about a host was stored in the store struct.

       Returns 1 if it reached the end of public keys.

       Returns negative values for error
