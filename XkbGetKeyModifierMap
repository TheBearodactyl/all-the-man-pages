NAME
       XkbGetKeyModifierMap - Update the modifier map for one or more of the keys in a keyboard description

SYNOPSIS
       Status XkbGetKeyModifierMap (Display *dpy, unsigned int first, unsigned int num, XkbDescPtr xkb);

ARGUMENTS
       dpy    connection to X server

       first  keycode of first key to get

       num    number of keys for which information is desired

       xkb    keyboard description to update

DESCRIPTION
       The  modmap  entry of the client map is an array, indexed by keycode, specifying the real modifiers bound to a key. Each entry is a mask composed of a bitwise inclusive OR of the legal real modi‐
       fiers: ShiftMask, LockMask, ControlMask, Mod1Mask, Mod2Mask, Mod3Mask, Mod4Mask, and Mod5Mask. If a bit is set in a modmap entry, the corresponding key is bound to that modifier.

       Pressing or releasing the key bound to a modifier changes the modifier set and unset state. The particular manner in which the modifier set and unset state changes is determined by  the  behavior
       and actions assigned to the key.

       XkbGetKeyModifierMap  sends  a  request  to  the  server  for  the modifier mappings for num keys starting with the key whose keycode is first.  It waits for a reply and places the results in the
       xkb->map->modmap array. If successful, XkbGetKeyModifier returns Success.

       If the map component of the xkb parameter has not been allocated, XkbGetKeyModifierMap allocates and initializes it.

       If a compatible version of Xkb is not available in the server or the Xkb extension has not been properly initialized, XkbGetKeySyms returns BadAccess. If any allocation errors occur while obtain‐
       ing the modifier map, XkbGetKeyModifierMap returns BadAlloc.

DIAGNOSTICS
       BadAccess      The Xkb extension has not been properly initialized

       BadAlloc       Unable to allocate storage
