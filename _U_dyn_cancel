NAME
       _U_dyn_cancel -- cancel unwind-info for dynamically generated code

SYNOPSIS
       #include <libunwind.h>

       void _U_dyn_cancel(unw_dyn_info_t *di);

DESCRIPTION
       The _U_dyn_cancel() routine cancels the registration of the unwind-info for a dynamically generated procedure. Argument di is the pointer to the unw_dyn_info_t structure that describes the proce‚Äê
       dure's unwind-info.

       The _U_dyn_cancel() routine is guaranteed to execute in constant time (in the absence of contention from concurrent calls to _U_dyn_register() or _U_dyn_cancel()).

THREAD AND SIGNAL SAFETY
       _U_dyn_cancel() is thread-safe but not safe to use from a signal handler.
