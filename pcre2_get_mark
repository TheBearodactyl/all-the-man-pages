SYNOPSIS

       #include <pcre2.h>

       PCRE2_SPTR pcre2_get_mark(pcre2_match_data *match_data);

DESCRIPTION

       After  a  call of pcre2_match() that was passed the match block that is
       this function's argument, this function returns a pointer to  the  last
       (*MARK),  (*PRUNE),  or  (*THEN)  name  that was encountered during the
       matching process. The name is zero-terminated, and is within  the  com‚Äê
       piled pattern. The length of the name is in the preceding code unit. If
       no name is available, NULL is returned.

       After a successful match, the name that is returned is the last one  on
       the  matching  path.  After a failed match or a partial match, the last
       encountered name is returned.

       There is a complete description of the PCRE2 native API in the pcre2api
       page and a description of the POSIX API in the pcre2posix page.
