NAME
       rand, rand_r, srand - pseudo-random number generator

LIBRARY
       Standard C library (libc, -lc)

SYNOPSIS
       #include <stdlib.h>

       int rand(void);
       void srand(unsigned int seed);

       [[deprecated]] int rand_r(unsigned int *seedp);

   Feature Test Macro Requirements for glibc (see feature_test_macros(7)):

       rand_r():
           Since glibc 2.24:
               _POSIX_C_SOURCE >= 199506L
           glibc 2.23 and earlier
               _POSIX_C_SOURCE

DESCRIPTION
       The  rand()  function returns a pseudo-random integer in the range 0 to
       RAND_MAX inclusive (i.e., the mathematical range [0, RAND_MAX]).

       The srand() function sets its argument as the seed for a  new  sequence
       of  pseudo-random  integers  to be returned by rand().  These sequences
       are repeatable by calling srand() with the same seed value.

       If no seed value is provided,  the  rand()  function  is  automatically
       seeded with a value of 1.

       The  function  rand() is not reentrant, since it uses hidden state that
       is modified on each call.  This might just be the seed value to be used
       by the next call, or it might be something more elaborate.  In order to
       get reproducible behavior in a threaded application, this state must be
       made explicit; this can be done using the reentrant function rand_r().

       Like  rand(),  rand_r()  returns  a  pseudo-random integer in the range
       [0, RAND_MAX].  The seedp argument is a pointer to an unsigned int that
       is  used  to store state between calls.  If rand_r() is called with the
       same initial value for the integer pointed to by seedp, and that  value
       is  not  modified  between  calls, then the same pseudo-random sequence
       will result.

       The value pointed to by the seedp argument of rand_r() provides only  a
       very small amount of state, so this function will be a weak pseudo-ran‐
       dom generator.  Try drand48_r(3) instead.

RETURN VALUE
       The rand() and rand_r() functions return a value between 0 and RAND_MAX
       (inclusive).  The srand() function returns no value.

VERSIONS
       The versions of rand() and srand() in the Linux C Library use the  same
       random number generator as random(3) and srandom(3), so the lower-order
       bits should be as random as the higher-order bits.  However,  on  older
       rand()  implementations,  and  on  current implementations on different
       systems, the lower-order bits are much less random than the  higher-or‐
       der bits.  Do not use this function in applications intended to be por‐
       table when good randomness is needed.  (Use random(3) instead.)

EXAMPLES
       POSIX.1-2001 gives the following example of an implementation of rand()
       and  srand(),  possibly  useful when one needs the same sequence on two
       different machines.

           static unsigned long next = 1;

           /* RAND_MAX assumed to be 32767 */
           int myrand(void) {
               next = next * 1103515245 + 12345;
               return((unsigned)(next/65536) % 32768);
           }

           void mysrand(unsigned int seed) {
               next = seed;
           }

       The following program can be used to display the pseudo-random sequence
       produced  by rand() when given a particular seed.  When the seed is -1,
       the program uses a random seed.

           #include <stdio.h>
           #include <stdlib.h>

           int
           main(int argc, char *argv[])
           {
               int           r;
               unsigned int  seed, nloops;

               if (argc != 3) {
                   fprintf(stderr, "Usage: %s <seed> <nloops>\n", argv[0]);
                   exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
               }

               seed = atoi(argv[1]);
               nloops = atoi(argv[2]);

               if (seed == -1) {
                   seed = arc4random();
                   printf("seed: %u\n", seed);
               }

               srand(seed);
               for (unsigned int j = 0; j < nloops; j++) {
                   r =  rand();
                   printf("%d\n", r);
               }

               exit(EXIT_SUCCESS);
           }

NAME
       rand, rand_r, srand — pseudo-random number generator

SYNOPSIS
       #include <stdlib.h>

       int rand(void);
       int rand_r(unsigned *seed);
       void srand(unsigned seed);

DESCRIPTION
       For rand() and srand(): The functionality described on  this  reference
       page  is  aligned with the ISO C standard. Any conflict between the re‐
       quirements described here and the ISO C standard is unintentional. This
       volume of POSIX.1‐2017 defers to the ISO C standard.

       The  rand() function shall compute a sequence of pseudo-random integers
       in the range [0,{RAND_MAX}] with a period of at least 232.

       The rand() function need not be thread-safe.

       The rand_r() function shall compute a sequence of  pseudo-random  inte‐
       gers  in  the range [0,{RAND_MAX}].  (The value of the {RAND_MAX} macro
       shall be at least 32767.)

       If rand_r() is called with  the  same  initial  value  for  the  object
       pointed  to  by seed and that object is not modified between successive
       returns and calls to rand_r(), the same sequence shall be generated.

       The srand() function uses the argument as a seed for a new sequence  of
       pseudo-random numbers to be returned by subsequent calls to rand().  If
       srand() is then called with  the  same  seed  value,  the  sequence  of
       pseudo-random numbers shall be repeated. If rand() is called before any
       calls to srand() are made, the same sequence shall be generated as when
       srand() is first called with a seed value of 1.

       The  implementation shall behave as if no function defined in this vol‐
       ume of POSIX.1‐2017 calls rand() or srand().

RETURN VALUE
       The rand() function shall return the next pseudo-random number  in  the
       sequence.

       The rand_r() function shall return a pseudo-random integer.

       The srand() function shall not return a value.

ERRORS
       No errors are defined.

       The following sections are informative.

EXAMPLES
   Generating a Pseudo-Random Number Sequence
       The  following  example  demonstrates  how  to  generate  a sequence of
       pseudo-random numbers.

           #include <stdio.h>
           #include <stdlib.h>
           ...
               long count, i;
               char *keystr;
               int elementlen, len;
               char c;
           ...
           /* Initial random number generator. */
               srand(1);

               /* Create keys using only lowercase characters */
               len = 0;
               for (i=0; i<count; i++) {
                   while (len < elementlen) {
                       c = (char) (rand() % 128);
                       if (islower(c))
                           keystr[len++] = c;
                   }

                   keystr[len] = '\0';
                   printf("%s Element%0*ld\n", keystr, elementlen, i);
                   len = 0;
               }

   Generating the Same Sequence on Different Machines
       The following code defines a pair of functions that could  be  incorpo‐
       rated  into  applications  wishing  to ensure that the same sequence of
       numbers is generated across different machines.

           static unsigned long next = 1;
           int myrand(void)  /* RAND_MAX assumed to be 32767. */
           {
               next = next * 1103515245 + 12345;
               return((unsigned)(next/65536) % 32768);
           }

           void mysrand(unsigned seed)
           {
               next = seed;
           }

APPLICATION USAGE
       The drand48()  and  random()  functions  provide  much  more  elaborate
       pseudo-random number generators.

       The  limitations on the amount of state that can be carried between one
       function call and another mean the rand_r() function can never  be  im‐
       plemented in a way which satisfies all of the requirements on a pseudo-
       random number generator.

       These functions should be  avoided  whenever  non-trivial  requirements
       (including safety) have to be fulfilled.

RATIONALE
       The  ISO C  standard  rand()  and  srand()  functions allow per-process
       pseudo-random streams shared by all threads. Those two  functions  need
       not  change,  but there has to be mutual-exclusion that prevents inter‐
       ference between two threads concurrently accessing  the  random  number
       generator.

       With  regard  to  rand(), there are two different behaviors that may be
       wanted in a multi-threaded program:

        1. A single per-process sequence  of  pseudo-random  numbers  that  is
           shared by all threads that call rand()

        2. A  different sequence of pseudo-random numbers for each thread that
           calls rand()

       This is provided by the modified thread-safe function based on  whether
       the seed value is global to the entire process or local to each thread.

       This does not address the known deficiencies of the rand() function im‐
       plementations, which have been approached by maintaining more state. In
       effect, this specifies new thread-safe forms of a deficient function.

FUTURE DIRECTIONS
       The rand_r() function may be removed in a future version.
