NAME
       FcWeightFromOpenTypeDouble - Convert from OpenType weight values to fontconfig ones

SYNOPSIS
       #include <fontconfig/fontconfig.h>

       double FcWeightFromOpenTypeDouble (doubleot_weight);

DESCRIPTION
       FcWeightFromOpenTypeDouble  returns  an  double value to use with FC_WEIGHT, from an double in the 1..1000 range, resembling the numbers from OpenType specification's OS/2 usWeight numbers, which
       are also similar to CSS font-weight numbers.  If input is negative, zero, or greater than 1000, returns -1.  This function linearly interpolates between various FC_WEIGHT_* constants.   As  such,
       the returned value does not necessarily match any of the predefined constants.
