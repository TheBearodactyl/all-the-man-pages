DESCRIPTION
       ldns_pkt2buffer_str() Converts the data in the DNS packet to presentation format (as char *) and appends it to the given buffer

              output: pointer to the buffer to append the data to
              pkt: the pointer to the packet to convert
              Returns status

       ldns_pktheader2buffer_str() Converts the header of a packet to presentation format and appends it to the output buffer
              output: the buffer to append output to
              pkt: the packet to convert the header of
              Returns ldns_status

       ldns_rr2buffer_str() Converts the data in the resource record to presentation format (as char *) and appends it to the given buffer.  The presentation format of DNSKEY record is annotated with
              comments giving the id, type and size of the key.

              output: pointer to the buffer to append the data to
              rr: the pointer to the rr field to convert
              Returns status

       ldns_rr_list2buffer_str() Converts a rr_list to presentation format and appends it to the output buffer
              output: the buffer to append output to
              list: the ldns_rr_list to print
              Returns ldns_status

       ldns_rdf2buffer_str() Converts the data in the rdata field to presentation format (as char *) and appends it to the given buffer

              output: pointer to the buffer to append the data to
              rdf: the pointer to the rdafa field containing the data
              Returns status

       ldns_key2buffer_str() Converts the data in the DNS packet to presentation format (as char *) and appends it to the given buffer

              output: pointer to the buffer to append the data to
              k: the pointer to the private key to convert
              Returns status

       ldns_pkt2buffer_wire() Copies the packet data to the buffer in wire format
              *output: buffer to append the result to
              *pkt: packet to convert
              Returns ldns_status

       ldns_rr2buffer_wire() Copies the rr data to the buffer in wire format
              *output: buffer to append the result to
              *rr: resource record to convert
              section: the section in the packet this rr is supposed to be in (to determine whether to add rdata or not)
              Returns ldns_status

       ldns_rdf2buffer_wire() Copies the rdata data to the buffer in wire format
              *output: buffer to append the result to
              *rdf: rdata to convert
              Returns ldns_status

       ldns_rrsig2buffer_wire() Converts a rrsig to wireformat BUT EXCLUDE the rrsig rdata This is needed in DNSSEC verification
              output: buffer to append the result to
              sigrr: signature rr to operate on
              Returns ldns_status

       ldns_rr_rdata2buffer_wire() Converts an rr's rdata to wireformat, while excluding the ownername and all the stuff before the rdata.  This is needed in DNSSEC keytag calculation, the ds calcula‐
              tion from the key and maybe elsewhere.

              *output: buffer where to put the result
              *rr: rr to operate on
              Returns ldns_status
