NAME
       XkbGetGeometry - Loads a keyboard geometry if you already have the keyboard description

SYNOPSIS
       Status XkbGetGeometry (Display *dpy, XkbDescPtr xkb);

ARGUMENTS
       dpy    connection to the X server

       xkb    keyboard description that contains the ID for the keyboard and into which the geometry should be loaded

       You  can load a keyboard geometry as part of the keyboard description returned by XkbGetKeyboard.  However, if a keyboard description has been previously loaded, you can instead obtain the geome‚Äê
       try by calling the XkbGetGeometry.  In this case, the geometry returned is the one associated with the keyboard whose device ID is contained in the keyboard description.

       XkbGetGeometry can return BadValue, BadImplementation, BadName, BadAlloc, or BadLength errors or Success if it succeeds.

       BadAlloc       Unable to allocate storage

       BadImplementation
                      Invalid reply from server
