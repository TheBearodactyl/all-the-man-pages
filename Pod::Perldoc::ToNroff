Pod::Perldoc::ToNroff(3Perl)Programmers Reference Pod::Perldoc::ToNroff(3perl)

NAME
       Pod::Perldoc::ToNroff - let Perldoc convert Pod to nroff

SYNOPSIS
         perldoc -o nroff -d something.3 Some::Modulename

DESCRIPTION
       This is a "plug-in" class that allows Perldoc to use Pod::Man as a
       formatter class.

       The following options are supported:  center, date, fixed, fixedbold,
       fixeditalic, fixedbolditalic, quotes, release, section

       Those options are explained in Pod::Man.

       For example:

         perldoc -o nroff -w center:Pod -d something.3 Some::Modulename

CAVEAT
       This module may change to use a different pod-to-nroff formatter class
       in the future, and this may change what options are supported.
