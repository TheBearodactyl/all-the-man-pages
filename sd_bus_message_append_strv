SD_BUS_MESSAGE_APPEND_STRVsd_bus_message_append_sSD_BUS_MESSAGE_APPEND_STRV(3)

NAME
       sd_bus_message_append_strv - Attach an array of strings to a message

SYNOPSIS
       #include <systemd/sd-bus.h>

       int sd_bus_message_append_strv(sd_bus_message *m, char **l);

DESCRIPTION
       The sd_bus_message_append() function can be used to append an array of
       strings to message m. The parameter l shall point to a NULL-terminated
       array of pointers to NUL-terminated strings. Each string must satisfy
       the same constraints as described for the "s" type in
       sd_bus_message_append_basic(3).

       The memory pointed at by p and the contents of the strings themselves
       are copied into the memory area containing the message and may be
       changed after this call. Note that the signature of l parameter is to
       be treated as const char *const *, and the contents will not be
       modified.

RETURN VALUE
       On success, this call returns 0 or a positive integer. On failure, a
       negative errno-style error code is returned.

   Errors
       Returned errors may indicate the following problems:

       -EINVAL
           Specified parameter is invalid.

       -EPERM
           Message has been sealed.

       -ESTALE
           Message is in invalid state.

       -ENXIO
           Message cannot be appended to.

       -ENOMEM
           Memory allocation failed.

NOTES
       These APIs are implemented as a shared library, which can be compiled
       and linked to with the libsystemd pkg-config(1) file.
