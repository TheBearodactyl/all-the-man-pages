NAME
       Test2::EventFacet::Plan - Facet for setting the plan

DESCRIPTION
       Events use this facet when they need to set the plan.

FIELDS
       $string = $plan->{details}
       $string = $plan->details()
           Human readable explanation for the plan being set. This is normally not rendered by most formatters except when the "skip" field is also set.

       $positive_int = $plan->{count}
       $positive_int = $plan->count()
           Set the number of expected assertions. This should usually be set to 0 when "skip" or "none" are also set.

       $bool = $plan->{skip}
       $bool = $plan->skip()
           When true the entire test should be skipped. This is usually paired with an explanation in the "details" field, and a "control" facet that has "terminate" set to 0.

       $bool = $plan->{none}
       $bool = $plan->none()
           This is mainly used by legacy Test::Builder tests which set the plan to "no plan", a construct that predates the much better "done_testing()".

           If you are using this in non-legacy code you may need to reconsider the course of your life, maybe a hermitage would suite you?
