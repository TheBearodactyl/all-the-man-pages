PCRE2_JIT_COMPILE(3)       Library Functions Manual       PCRE2_JIT_COMPILE(3)

NAME
       PCRE2 - Perl-compatible regular expressions (revised API)

SYNOPSIS

       #include <pcre2.h>

       int pcre2_jit_compile(pcre2_code *code, uint32_t options);

DESCRIPTION

       This function requests JIT compilation, which, if the just-in-time com‐
       piler is available, further processes a compiled pattern  into  machine
       code  that  executes  much  faster  than the pcre2_match() interpretive
       matching function. Full details are given in  the  pcre2jit  documenta‐
       tion.

       The  first argument is a pointer that was returned by a successful call
       to pcre2_compile(), and the second must contain one or more of the fol‐
       lowing bits:

         PCRE2_JIT_COMPLETE      compile code for full matching
         PCRE2_JIT_PARTIAL_SOFT  compile code for soft partial matching
         PCRE2_JIT_PARTIAL_HARD  compile code for hard partial matching

       There  is  also  an obsolete option called PCRE2_JIT_INVALID_UTF, which
       has been  superseded  by  the  pcre2_compile()  option  PCRE2_MATCH_IN‐
       VALID_UTF.  The  old option is deprecated and may be removed in the fu‐
       ture.

       The yield of the function is 0 for success, or a  negative  error  code
       otherwise.  In particular, PCRE2_ERROR_JIT_BADOPTION is returned if JIT
       is not supported or if an unknown bit is set in options.  The  function
       can  also return PCRE2_ERROR_NOMEMORY if JIT is unable to allocate exe‐
       cutable memory for the compiler, even if it was because of a system se‐
       curity restriction.

       There is a complete description of the PCRE2 native API in the pcre2api
       page and a description of the POSIX API in the pcre2posix page.
