NAME
       tcgetpgrp, tcsetpgrp - get and set terminal foreground process group

LIBRARY
       Standard C library (libc, -lc)

SYNOPSIS
       #include <unistd.h>

       pid_t tcgetpgrp(int fd);
       int tcsetpgrp(int fd, pid_t pgrp);

DESCRIPTION
       The function tcgetpgrp() returns the process group ID of the foreground process group on the terminal associated to fd, which must be the controlling terminal of the calling process.

       The  function  tcsetpgrp()  makes the process group with process group ID pgrp the foreground process group on the terminal associated to fd, which must be the controlling terminal of the calling
       process, and still be associated with its session.  Moreover, pgrp must be a (nonempty) process group belonging to the same session as the calling process.

       If tcsetpgrp() is called by a member of a background process group in its session, and the calling process is not blocking or ignoring SIGTTOU, a SIGTTOU signal is sent to  all  members  of  this
       background process group.

RETURN VALUE
       When  fd  refers  to  the controlling terminal of the calling process, the function tcgetpgrp() will return the foreground process group ID of that terminal if there is one, and some value larger
       than 1 that is not presently a process group ID otherwise.  When fd does not refer to the controlling terminal of the calling process, -1 is returned, and errno is set to indicate the error.

       When successful, tcsetpgrp() returns 0.  Otherwise, it returns -1, and errno is set to indicate the error.

ERRORS
       EBADF  fd is not a valid file descriptor.

       EINVAL pgrp has an unsupported value.

       ENOTTY The calling process does not have a controlling terminal, or it has one but it is not described by fd, or, for tcsetpgrp(), this controlling terminal is no longer associated with the  ses‐
              sion of the calling process.

       EPERM  pgrp has a supported value, but is not the process group ID of a process in the same session as the calling process.

PROLOG

       the interface may not be implemented on Linux.

NAME
       tcsetpgrp — set the foreground process group ID

SYNOPSIS
       #include <unistd.h>

       int tcsetpgrp(int fildes, pid_t pgid_id);

DESCRIPTION
       If the process has a controlling terminal, tcsetpgrp() shall set the foreground process group ID associated with the terminal to pgid_id.  The application shall ensure that  the  file  associated
       with  fildes is the controlling terminal of the calling process and the controlling terminal is currently associated with the session of the calling process. The application shall ensure that the
       value of pgid_id matches a process group ID of a process in the same session as the calling process.

       Attempts to use tcsetpgrp() from a process which is a member of a background process group on a fildes associated with its controlling terminal shall cause the process group to be sent a  SIGTTOU
       signal. If the calling thread is blocking SIGTTOU signals or the process is ignoring SIGTTOU signals, the process shall be allowed to perform the operation, and no signal is sent.

RETURN VALUE
       Upon successful completion, 0 shall be returned. Otherwise, -1 shall be returned and errno set to indicate the error.

ERRORS
       The tcsetpgrp() function shall fail if:

       EBADF  The fildes argument is not a valid file descriptor.

       EINVAL This implementation does not support the value in the pgid_id argument.

       EIO    The process group of the writing process is orphaned, the calling thread is not blocking SIGTTOU, and the process is not ignoring SIGTTOU.

       ENOTTY The  calling  process does not have a controlling terminal, or the file is not the controlling terminal, or the controlling terminal is no longer associated with the session of the calling
              process.

       EPERM  The value of pgid_id is a value supported by the implementation, but does not match the process group ID of a process in the same session as the calling process.
