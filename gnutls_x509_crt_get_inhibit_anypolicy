NAME
       gnutls_x509_crt_get_inhibit_anypolicy - API function

SYNOPSIS
       #include <gnutls/x509.h>

       int gnutls_x509_crt_get_inhibit_anypolicy(gnutls_x509_crt_t cert, unsigned int * skipcerts, unsigned int * critical);

ARGUMENTS
       gnutls_x509_crt_t cert
                   should contain a gnutls_x509_crt_t type

       unsigned int * skipcerts
                   will hold the number of certificates after which anypolicy is no longer acceptable.

       unsigned int * critical
                   will be non-zero if the extension is marked as critical

DESCRIPTION
       This function will return certificate's value of the SkipCerts, i.e., the Inhibit anyPolicy X.509 extension (2.5.29.54).

       The returned value is the number of additional certificates that may appear in the path before the anyPolicy is no longer acceptable.

RETURNS
       zero on success, or a negative error code in case of parsing error.  If the certificate does not contain the Inhibit anyPolicy extension GNUTLS_E_REQUESTED_DATA_NOT_AVAILABLE will be returned.

SINCE
       3.6.0
