PAL2RGB(1)                          LibTIFF                         PAL2RGB(1)

NAME
       pal2rgb - convert a palette color TIFF image to a full color image

SYNOPSIS
       pal2rgb [ options ] input.tif output.tif

DESCRIPTION
       pal2rgb  converts a palette color image to a full color image by apply‐
       ing the colormap of the palette image to each sample to generate a full
       color RGB image.

OPTIONS
       Options that affect the interpretation of input data are:

       -C numentries
              This  option overrides the default behavior of pal2rgb in deter‐
              mining whether or not colormap entries contain 16-bit  or  8-bit
              values.  By default the colormap is inspected and if no colormap
              entry greater than 255 is found, the colormap is assumed to have
              only  8-bit  values; otherwise 16-bit values (as required by the
              TIFF specification) are assumed.  The -C option can be  used  to
              explicitly specify the number of bits for colormap entries: -C 8
              for 8-bit values, -C 16 for 16-bit values.

       Options that affect the output file format are:

       -p planarconfig
              Explicitly select the planar configuration  used  in  organizing
              data  samples  in the output image: -p contig for samples packed
              contiguously, and -p separate for samples stored separately.  By
              default samples are packed.

       -c compress
              Use the specified compression algorithm to encoded image data in
              the output file: -c packbits for Macintosh Packbits, -c lzw  for
              Lempel-Ziv  & Welch, -c zip for Deflate, -c none for no compres‐
              sion.  If no compression-related option is specified, the  input
              file’s compression algorithm is used.

       -r striprows
              Explicitly  specify the number of rows in each strip of the out‐
              put file. If the -r option is not specified,  a  number  is  se‐
              lected such that each output strip has approximately 8 kilobytes
              of data in it.

BUGS
       Only 8-bit images are handled.
