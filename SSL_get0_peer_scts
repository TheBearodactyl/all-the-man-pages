SSL_GET0_PEER_SCTS(3ssl)            OpenSSL           SSL_GET0_PEER_SCTS(3ssl)

NAME
       SSL_get0_peer_scts - get SCTs received

SYNOPSIS
        #include <openssl/ssl.h>

        const STACK_OF(SCT) *SSL_get0_peer_scts(SSL *s);

DESCRIPTION
       SSL_get0_peer_scts() returns the signed certificate timestamps (SCTs)
       that have been received. If this is the first time that this function
       has been called for a given SSL instance, it will examine the TLS
       extensions, OCSP response and the peer's certificate for SCTs. Future
       calls will return the same SCTs.

RESTRICTIONS
       If no Certificate Transparency validation callback has been set (using
       SSL_CTX_set_ct_validation_callback or SSL_set_ct_validation_callback),
       this function is not guaranteed to return all of the SCTs that the peer
       is capable of sending.

RETURN VALUES
       SSL_get0_peer_scts() returns a list of SCTs found, or NULL if an error
       occurs.
