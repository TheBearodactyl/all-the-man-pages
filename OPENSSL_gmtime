OPENSSL_GMTIME(3ssl)                OpenSSL               OPENSSL_GMTIME(3ssl)

NAME
       OPENSSL_gmtime, OPENSSL_gmtime_adj, OPENSSL_gmtime_diff -
       platform-agnostic OpenSSL time routines

SYNOPSIS
        #include <openssl/crypto.h>

        struct tm *OPENSSL_gmtime(const time_t *timer, struct tm *result);
        int OPENSSL_gmtime_adj(struct tm *tm, int offset_day, long offset_sec);
        int OPENSSL_gmtime_diff(int *pday, int *psec,
                               const struct tm *from, const struct tm *to);

DESCRIPTION
       OPENSSL_gmtime() returns the UTC time specified by timer into the
       provided result argument.

       OPENSSL_gmtime_adj() adds the offsets in offset_day and offset_sec to
       tm.

       OPENSSL_gmtime_diff() calculates the difference between from and to.

NOTES
       It is an error to call OPENSSL_gmtime() with result equal to NULL. The
       contents of the time_t given by timer are stored into the result.
       Calling with timer equal to NULL means use the current time.

       OPENSSL_gmtime_adj() converts tm into a days and seconds value, adds
       the offsets, then converts back into a struct tm specified by tm. Leap
       seconds are not considered.

       OPENSSL_gmtime_diff() calculates the difference between the two struct
       tm structures from and to. The difference in days is placed into *pday,
       the remaining seconds are placed to *psec. The value in *psec will be
       less than the number of seconds per day (3600). Leap seconds are not
       considered.

RETURN VALUES
       OPENSSL_gmtime() returns NULL on error, or result on success.

       OPENSSL_gmtime_adj() and OPENSSL_gmtime_diff() return 0 on error, and 1
       on success.

HISTORY
       OPENSSL_gmtime(), OPENSSL_gmtime_adj() and OPENSSL_gmtime_diff() have
       been in OpenSSL since 1.0.0.
