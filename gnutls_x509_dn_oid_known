NAME
       gnutls_x509_dn_oid_known - API function

SYNOPSIS
       #include <gnutls/x509.h>

       int gnutls_x509_dn_oid_known(const char * oid);

ARGUMENTS
       const char * oid
                   holds an Object Identifier in a null terminated string

DESCRIPTION
       This function will inform about known DN OIDs. This is useful since functions like gnutls_x509_crt_set_dn_by_oid() use the information on known OIDs to properly encode their input. Object Identi‐
       fiers that are not known are not encoded by these functions, and their input is stored directly into the ASN.1 structure. In that case of unknown OIDs, you have the responsibility of DER encoding
       your data.

RETURNS
       1 on known OIDs and 0 otherwise.
