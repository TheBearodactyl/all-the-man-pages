NAME
       ExtUtils::MM_Win95 - method to customize MakeMaker for Win9X

SYNOPSIS
         You should not be using this module directly.

DESCRIPTION
       This is a subclass of ExtUtils::MM_Win32 containing changes necessary to get MakeMaker playing nice with command.com and other Win9Xisms.

   Overridden methods
       Most of these make up for limitations in the Win9x/nmake command shell.

       max_exec_len
           Win98 chokes on things like Encode if we set the max length to nmake's max of 2K.  So we go for a more conservative value of 1K.

       os_flavor
           Win95 and Win98 and WinME are collectively Win9x and Win32
