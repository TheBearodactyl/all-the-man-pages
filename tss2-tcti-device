NAME
       tcti-device - device driver TCTI library

SYNOPSIS
       A TPM Command Transmission Interface (TCTI) module for interaction with the TPM device driver.

DESCRIPTION
       tcti-device  is  a library that abstracts the details of direct communication with the device node exposed by the Linux kernel driver (typically /dev/tpm0).  The interface exposed by this library
       is defined in the “TSS System Level API and TPM Command Transmission Interface Specification” specification.
