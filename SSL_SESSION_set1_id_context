SSL_SESSION_GET0_ID_CONTEXT(3ssl)   OpenSSL  SSL_SESSION_GET0_ID_CONTEXT(3ssl)

NAME
       SSL_SESSION_get0_id_context, SSL_SESSION_set1_id_context - get and set
       the SSL ID context associated with a session

SYNOPSIS
        #include <openssl/ssl.h>

        const unsigned char *SSL_SESSION_get0_id_context(const SSL_SESSION *s,
                                                         unsigned int *len);
        int SSL_SESSION_set1_id_context(SSL_SESSION *s, const unsigned char *sid_ctx,
                                       unsigned int sid_ctx_len);

DESCRIPTION
       See SSL_CTX_set_session_id_context(3) for further details on session ID
       contexts.

       SSL_SESSION_get0_id_context() returns the ID context associated with
       the SSL/TLS session s. The length of the ID context is written to *len
       if len is not NULL.

       The value returned is a pointer to an object maintained within s and
       should not be released.

       SSL_SESSION_set1_id_context() takes a copy of the provided ID context
       given in sid_ctx and associates it with the session s. The length of
       the ID context is given by sid_ctx_len which must not exceed
       SSL_MAX_SID_CTX_LENGTH bytes.

RETURN VALUES
       SSL_SESSION_set1_id_context() returns 1 on success or 0 on error.
