NAME
       gnutls_record_recv_early_data - API function

SYNOPSIS
       #include <gnutls/gnutls.h>

       ssize_t gnutls_record_recv_early_data(gnutls_session_t session, void * data, size_t data_size);

ARGUMENTS
       gnutls_session_t session
                   is a gnutls_session_t type.

       void * data the buffer that the data will be read into

       size_t data_size
                   the number of requested bytes

DESCRIPTION
       This  function  can  be used by a server to retrieve data sent early in the handshake processes when resuming a session.  This is used to implement a zero-roundtrip (0-RTT) mode.  It has the same
       semantics as gnutls_record_recv().

       This function can be called either in a handshake hook, or after the handshake is complete.

RETURNS
       The number of bytes received and zero when early data reading is complete.  A negative error code is returned in case of an error.  If no early data is received during the handshake,  this  func‐
       tion returns GNUTLS_E_REQUESTED_DATA_NOT_AVAILABLE.  The number of bytes received might be less than the requested
        data_size .

SINCE
       3.6.5
