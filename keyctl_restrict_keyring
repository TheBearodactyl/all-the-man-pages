NAME
       keyctl_restrict_keyring - restrict keys that may be linked to a keyring

SYNOPSIS
       #include <keyutils.h>

       long keyctl_restrict_keyring(key_serial_t keyring,
       const char *type, const char *restriction);

DESCRIPTION
       keyctl_restrict_keyring()  limits  the  linkage  of keys to the given keyring using a provided key type and restriction scheme. The available options vary depending on the key type, and typically
       contain a restriction name possibly followed by key ids or other data relevant to the restriction. If the type and restriction are both NULL, the keyring will reject all links.

RETURN VALUE
       On success keyctl_restrict_keyring() returns 0.  On error, the value -1 will be returned and errno will have been set to an appropriate error.

ERRORS
       EDEADLK
              A restriction cycle was avoided. Two keyrings cannot restrict each other.

       EEXIST The keyring is already restricted.

       EINVAL The restriction string is invalid or too large.

       ENOKEY The key type in the restriction is invalid or not available.

       ENOTDIR
              The provided key id references an item that is not a keyring.

       ENOENT The key type exists but does not support restrictions.

LINKING
       This is a library function that can be found in libkeyutils.  When linking, -lkeyutils should be specified to the linker.
