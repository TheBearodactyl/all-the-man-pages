BIO_S_SOCKET(3ssl)                  OpenSSL                 BIO_S_SOCKET(3ssl)

NAME
       BIO_s_socket, BIO_new_socket - socket BIO

SYNOPSIS
        #include <openssl/bio.h>

        const BIO_METHOD *BIO_s_socket(void);

        BIO *BIO_new_socket(int sock, int close_flag);

DESCRIPTION
       BIO_s_socket() returns the socket BIO method. This is a wrapper round
       the platform's socket routines.

       BIO_read_ex() and BIO_write_ex() read or write the underlying socket.
       BIO_puts() is supported but BIO_gets() is not.

       If the close flag is set then the socket is shut down and closed when
       the BIO is freed.

       BIO_new_socket() returns a socket BIO using sock and close_flag.

NOTES
       Socket BIOs also support any relevant functionality of file descriptor
       BIOs.

       The reason for having separate file descriptor and socket BIOs is that
       on some platforms sockets are not file descriptors and use distinct I/O
       routines, Windows is one such platform. Any code mixing the two will
       not work on all platforms.

RETURN VALUES
       BIO_s_socket() returns the socket BIO method.

       BIO_new_socket() returns the newly allocated BIO or NULL is an error
       occurred.
