NAME
       XSetSelectionOwner, XGetSelectionOwner, XConvertSelection - manipulate window selection

SYNTAX
       int XSetSelectionOwner(Display *display, Atom selection, Window owner, Time time);

       Window XGetSelectionOwner(Display *display, Atom selection);

       int XConvertSelection(Display *display, Atom selection, Atom target, Atom property, Window requestor, Time time);

ARGUMENTS
       display   Specifies the connection to the X server.

       owner     Specifies the owner of the specified selection atom.  You can pass a window or None.

       property  Specifies the property name.  You also can pass None.

       requestor Specifies the requestor.

       selection Specifies the selection atom.

       target    Specifies the target atom.

       time      Specifies the time.  You can pass either a timestamp or CurrentTime.

DESCRIPTION
       The  XSetSelectionOwner  function  changes  the  owner and last-change time for the specified selection and has no effect if the specified time is earlier than the current last-change time of the
       specified selection or is later than the current X server time.  Otherwise, the last-change time is set to the specified time, with CurrentTime replaced by the current server time.  If the  owner
       window is specified as None, then the owner of the selection becomes None (that is, no owner).  Otherwise, the owner of the selection becomes the client executing the request.

       If  the  new  owner  (whether  a client or None) is not the same as the current owner of the selection and the current owner is not None, the current owner is sent a SelectionClear event.  If the
       client that is the owner of a selection is later terminated (that is, its connection is closed) or if the owner window it has specified in the request is later destroyed, the owner of the  selec‐
       tion automatically reverts to None, but the last-change time is not affected.  The selection atom is uninterpreted by the X server.  XGetSelectionOwner returns the owner window, which is reported
       in SelectionRequest and SelectionClear events.  Selections are global to the X server.

       XSetSelectionOwner can generate BadAtom and BadWindow errors.

       The XGetSelectionOwner function returns the window ID associated with the window that currently owns the specified selection.  If no selection was specified, the  function  returns  the  constant
       None.  If None is returned, there is no owner for the selection.

       XGetSelectionOwner can generate a BadAtom error.

       XConvertSelection requests that the specified selection be converted to the specified target type:

       •    If the specified selection has an owner, the X server sends a SelectionRequest event to that owner.

       •    If no owner for the specified selection exists, the X server generates a SelectionNotify event to the requestor with property None.

       The arguments are passed on unchanged in either of the events.  There are two predefined selection atoms: PRIMARY and SECONDARY.

       XConvertSelection can generate BadAtom and BadWindow errors.

DIAGNOSTICS
       BadAtom   A value for an Atom argument does not name a defined Atom.

       BadWindow A value for a Window argument does not name a defined Window.
