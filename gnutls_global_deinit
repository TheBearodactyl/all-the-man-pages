NAME
       gnutls_global_deinit - API function

SYNOPSIS
       #include <gnutls/gnutls.h>

       void gnutls_global_deinit( void);

ARGUMENTS
        void

DESCRIPTION
       This function deinitializes the global data, that were initialized using gnutls_global_init().

       Since  GnuTLS 3.3.0 this function is no longer necessary to be explicitly called. GnuTLS will automatically deinitialize on library destructor. See gnutls_global_init() for disabling the implicit
       initialization/deinitialization.
