NAME
       gnutls_store_pubkey - API function

SYNOPSIS
       #include <gnutls/gnutls.h>

       int  gnutls_store_pubkey(const  char * db_name, gnutls_tdb_t tdb, const char * host, const char * service, gnutls_certificate_type_t cert_type, const gnutls_datum_t * cert, time_t expiration, un‐
       signed int flags);

ARGUMENTS
       const char * db_name
                   A file specifying the stored keys (use NULL for the default)

       gnutls_tdb_t tdb
                   A storage structure or NULL to use the default

       const char * host
                   The peer's name

       const char * service
                   non-NULL if this key is specific to a service (e.g. http)

       gnutls_certificate_type_t cert_type
                   The type of the certificate

       const gnutls_datum_t * cert
                   The data of the certificate

       time_t expiration
                   The expiration time (use 0 to disable expiration)

       unsigned int flags
                   should be 0.

DESCRIPTION
       This function will store a raw public-key or a public-key provided via a raw (DER-encoded) certificate to the list of stored public keys. The key will be considered valid until the provided expi‐
       ration time.

       The  tdb variable if non-null specifies a custom backend for the storage of entries. If it is NULL then the default file backend will be used.

       Unless  an alternative  tdb is provided, the storage format is a textual format consisting of a line for each host with fields separated by '|'. The contents of the fields are a format-identifier
       which is set to 'g0', the hostname that the rest of the data applies to, the numeric port or host name, the expiration time in seconds since the epoch (0 for no expiration), and a base64 encoding
       of the raw (DER) public key information (SPKI) of the peer.

       As of GnuTLS 3.6.6 this function also accepts raw public keys.

RETURNS
       On success, GNUTLS_E_SUCCESS (0) is returned, otherwise a negative error value.

SINCE
       3.0.13
