RAND_CLEANUP(3ssl)                  OpenSSL                 RAND_CLEANUP(3ssl)

NAME
       RAND_cleanup - erase the PRNG state

SYNOPSIS
        #include <openssl/rand.h>

       The following function has been deprecated since OpenSSL 1.1.0, and can
       be hidden entirely by defining OPENSSL_API_COMPAT with a suitable
       version value, see openssl_user_macros(7):

        void RAND_cleanup(void);

DESCRIPTION
       Prior to OpenSSL 1.1.0, RAND_cleanup() released all resources used by
       the PRNG.  As of version 1.1.0, it does nothing and should not be
       called, since no explicit initialisation or de-initialisation is
       necessary. See OPENSSL_init_crypto(3).

RETURN VALUES
       RAND_cleanup() returns no value.

SEE ALSO
       RAND(7)

HISTORY
       RAND_cleanup() was deprecated in OpenSSL 1.1.0; do not use it.  See
       OPENSSL_init_crypto(3)
