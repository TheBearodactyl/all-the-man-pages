POSIX_TRACE_GET_FILTER(3P) POSIX Programmer's ManualPOSIX_TRACE_GET_FILTER(3P)

PROLOG
       This  manual  page is part of the POSIX Programmer's Manual.  The Linux
       implementation of this interface may differ (consult the  corresponding
       Linux  manual page for details of Linux behavior), or the interface may
       not be implemented on Linux.

NAME
       posix_trace_get_filter, posix_trace_set_filter — retrieve and  set  the
       filter of an initialized trace stream (TRACING)

SYNOPSIS
       #include <trace.h>

       int posix_trace_get_filter(trace_id_t trid, trace_event_set_t *set);
       int posix_trace_set_filter(trace_id_t trid,
           const trace_event_set_t *set, int how);

DESCRIPTION
       The posix_trace_get_filter() function shall retrieve, into the argument
       pointed to by set, the actual trace event filter from the trace  stream
       specified by trid.

       The  posix_trace_set_filter() function shall change the set of filtered
       trace event types after a trace stream identified by the trid  argument
       is  created.  This  function  may be called prior to starting the trace
       stream, or while the trace stream is active. By default, if no call  is
       made  to  posix_trace_set_filter(),  all trace events shall be recorded
       (that is, none of the trace event types are filtered out).

       If this function is called while the trace is in  progress,  a  special
       system  trace event, POSIX_TRACE_FILTER, shall be recorded in the trace
       indicating both the old and the new sets of filtered trace event  types
       (see  Table  2-4,  Trace  and  Trace Event Filter Options: System Trace
       Events and Table 2-6, Trace, Trace Log, and Trace Event Filter Options:
       System Trace Events).

       If the posix_trace_set_filter() function is interrupted by a signal, an
       error shall be returned and the filter shall not be  changed.  In  this
       case, the state of the trace stream shall not be changed.

       The  value of the argument how indicates the manner in which the set is
       to be changed and shall have one of the following values, as defined in
       the <trace.h> header:

       POSIX_TRACE_SET_EVENTSET
             The  resulting  set  of trace event types to be filtered shall be
             the trace event type set pointed to by the argument set.

       POSIX_TRACE_ADD_EVENTSET
             The resulting set of trace event types to be  filtered  shall  be
             the union of the current set and the trace event type set pointed
             to by the argument set.

       POSIX_TRACE_SUB_EVENTSET
             The resulting set of trace event types to be  filtered  shall  be
             all  trace event types in the current set that are not in the set
             pointed to by the argument set; that is, remove each  element  of
             the specified set from the current filter.

RETURN VALUE
       Upon  successful  completion,  these  functions shall return a value of
       zero. Otherwise, they shall return the corresponding error number.

       The posix_trace_get_filter() function stores the set of filtered  trace
       event types in set, if successful.

ERRORS
       These functions shall fail if:

       EINVAL The  value of the trid argument does not correspond to an active
              trace stream or the value of the argument pointed to by  set  is
              invalid.

       EINTR  The operation was interrupted by a signal.

APPLICATION USAGE

RATIONALE
       None.

FUTURE DIRECTIONS
       The posix_trace_get_filter() and posix_trace_set_filter() functions may
       be removed in a future version.
