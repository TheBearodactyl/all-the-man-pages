NAME
       gnutls_dh_get_prime_bits - API function

SYNOPSIS
       #include <gnutls/gnutls.h>

       int gnutls_dh_get_prime_bits(gnutls_session_t session);

ARGUMENTS
       gnutls_session_t session
                   is a gnutls session

DESCRIPTION
       This  function  will  return the bits of the prime used in the last Diffie-Hellman key exchange with the peer.  Should be used for both anonymous and ephemeral Diffie-Hellman.  Note that some ci‐
       phers, like RSA and DSA without DHE, do not use a Diffie-Hellman key exchange, and then this function will return 0.

RETURNS
       The Diffie-Hellman bit strength is returned, or 0 if no Diffie-Hellman key exchange was done, or a negative error code on failure.
