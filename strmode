strmode(3bsd)                        LOCAL                       strmode(3bsd)

NAME
     strmode — convert inode status information into a symbolic string

LIBRARY
     Utility functions from BSD systems (libbsd, -lbsd)

SYNOPSIS
     #include <string.h>
     (See libbsd(7) for include usage.)

     void
     strmode(mode_t mode, char *bp);

DESCRIPTION
     The strmode() function converts a file mode (the type and permission in‐
     formation associated with an inode, see stat(2)) into a symbolic string
     which is stored in the location referenced by bp.  This stored string is
     eleven characters in length plus a trailing NUL.

     The first character is the inode type, and will be one of the following:

           -     regular file
           b     block special
           c     character special
           d     directory
           l     symbolic link
           p     fifo
           s     socket
           w     whiteout
           ?     unknown inode type

     The next nine characters encode three sets of permissions, in three char‐
     acters each.  The first three characters are the permissions for the
     owner of the file, the second three for the group the file belongs to,
     and the third for the ``other'', or default, set of users.

     Permission checking is done as specifically as possible.  If read permis‐
     sion is denied to the owner of a file in the first set of permissions,
     the owner of the file will not be able to read the file.  This is true
     even if the owner is in the file's group and the group permissions allow
     reading or the ``other'' permissions allow reading.

     If the first character of the three character set is an ``r'', the file
     is readable for that set of users; if a dash ``-'', it is not readable.

     If the second character of the three character set is a ``w'', the file
     is writable for that set of users; if a dash ``-'', it is not writable.

     The third character is the first of the following characters that apply:

     S     If the character is part of the owner permissions and the file is
           not executable or the directory is not searchable by the owner, and
           the set-user-id bit is set.

     S     If the character is part of the group permissions and the file is
           not executable or the directory is not searchable by the group, and
           the set-group-id bit is set.

     T     If the character is part of the other permissions and the file is
           not executable or the directory is not searchable by others, and
           the ``sticky'' (S_ISVTX) bit is set.

     s     If the character is part of the owner permissions and the file is
           executable or the directory searchable by the owner, and the set-
           user-id bit is set.

     s     If the character is part of the group permissions and the file is
           executable or the directory searchable by the group, and the set-
           group-id bit is set.

     t     If the character is part of the other permissions and the file is
           executable or the directory searchable by others, and the
           ``sticky'' (S_ISVTX) bit is set.

     x     The file is executable or the directory is searchable.

     -     None of the above apply.

     The last character is a plus sign ``+'' if any there are any alternate or
     additional access control methods associated with the inode, otherwise it
     will be a space.
