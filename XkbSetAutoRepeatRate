NAME
       XkbSetAutoRepeatRate - Sets the attributes of the RepeatKeys control for a keyboard device

SYNOPSIS
       Bool XkbSetAutoRepeatRate (Display *display, unsigned int device_spec, unsigned int timeout, unsigned int interval);

ARGUMENTS
       display
              connection to X server

       device_spec
              device to configure, or XkbUseCoreKbd

       timeout
              initial delay, ms

       interval
              delay between repeats, ms

DESCRIPTION
       The core protocol allows only control over whether or not the entire keyboard or individual keys should auto-repeat when held down. RepeatKeys is a boolean control that extends this capability by
       adding control over the delay until a key begins to repeat and the rate at which it repeats. RepeatKeys is coupled with the core auto-repeat control: when RepeatKeys is enabled or  disabled,  the
       core auto-repeat is enabled or disabled and vice versa.

       Auto-repeating keys are controlled by two attributes. The first, timeout, is the delay after the initial press of an auto-repeating key and the first generated repeat event. The second, interval,
       is the delay between all subsequent generated repeat events. As with all boolean controls, configuring the attributes that determine how the control operates does  not  automatically  enable  the
       control as a whole.

       XkbSetAutoRepeatRate sends a request to the X server to configure the AutoRepeat control attributes to the values specified in timeout and interval.

       XkbSetAutoRepeatRate does not wait for a reply; it normally returns True. Specifying a zero value for either timeout or interval causes the server to generate a BadValue protocol error. If a com‚Äê
       patible version of the Xkb extension is not available in the server, XkbSetAutoRepeatRate returns False.

RETURN VALUES
       True           The XkbSetAutoRepeatRate function returns True normally.

       False          The XkbSetAutoRepeatRate function returns False if a compatible version of the Xkb extension is not available in the server.

DIAGNOSTICS
       BadValue       An argument is out of range
