NAME
       capng_have_capabilities, capng_have_permitted_capabilities - check for capabilities

SYNOPSIS
       #include <cap-ng.h>

       capng_results_t capng_have_capabilities(capng_select_t set); capng_results_t capng_have_permitted_capabilities(void);

DESCRIPTION
       capng_have_capabilities  will  check  the  selected  internal  capabilities  sets  to  see what the status is. The capabilities sets must be previously setup with calls to capng_get_caps_process,
       capng_get_caps_fd, or in some other way setup. The options are CAPNG_SELECT_CAPS for the traditional capabilities, CAPNG_SELECT_BOUNDS for the bounding set, CAPNG_SELECT_BOTH if checking both are
       desired,  CAPNG_SELECT_AMBIENT if only checking the ambient capabilities, or CAPNG_SELECT_ALL if testing all sets is desired. When capabilities are checked, it will only look at the effective ca‐
       pabilities.

       If, however, the source of capabilities comes from a file, then you may need to additionally check the permitted capabilities. It's for this reason that capng_have_permitted_capabilities was cre‐
       ated. It takes no arguments because it simply checks the permitted set.

RETURN VALUE
       This funtion will return one of the following four self explanatory values: CAPNG_FAIL, CAPNG_NONE, CAPNG_PARTIAL, CAPNG_FULL.
