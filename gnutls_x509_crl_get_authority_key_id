NAME
       gnutls_x509_crl_get_authority_key_id - API function

SYNOPSIS
       #include <gnutls/x509.h>

       int gnutls_x509_crl_get_authority_key_id(gnutls_x509_crl_t crl, void * id, size_t * id_size, unsigned int * critical);

ARGUMENTS
       gnutls_x509_crl_t crl
                   should contain a gnutls_x509_crl_t type

       void * id   The place where the identifier will be copied

       size_t * id_size
                   Holds the size of the result field.

       unsigned int * critical
                   will be non-zero if the extension is marked as critical (may be null)

DESCRIPTION
       This  function will return the CRL authority's key identifier.  This is obtained by the X.509 Authority Key identifier extension field (2.5.29.35).  Note that this function only returns the keyI‐
       dentifier field of the extension and GNUTLS_E_X509_UNSUPPORTED_EXTENSION, if the extension contains the name and serial  number  of  the  certificate.  In  that  case  gnutls_x509_crl_get_author‐
       ity_key_gn_serial() may be used.

RETURNS
       On success, GNUTLS_E_SUCCESS (0) is returned, otherwise a negative error code in case of an error.

SINCE
       2.8.0
