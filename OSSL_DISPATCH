OSSL_DISPATCH(3ssl)                 OpenSSL                OSSL_DISPATCH(3ssl)

NAME
       OSSL_DISPATCH - OpenSSL Core type to define a dispatchable function
       table

SYNOPSIS
        #include <openssl/core.h>

        typedef struct ossl_dispatch_st OSSL_DISPATCH;
        struct ossl_dispatch_st {
            int function_id;
            void (*function)(void);
        };

DESCRIPTION
       This type is a tuple of function identity and function pointer.  Arrays
       of this type are passed between the OpenSSL libraries and the providers
       to describe what functionality one side provides to the other.

       Arrays of this type must be terminated with a tuple having function
       identity zero and function pointer NULL.

   OSSL_DISPATCH fields
       function_id
           OpenSSL defined function identity of the implemented function.

       function
           Pointer to the implemented function itself.  Despite the generic
           definition of this field, the implemented function it points to
           must have a function signature that corresponds to the function_id

       Available function identities and corresponding function signatures are
       defined in openssl-core_dispatch.h(7).  Furthermore, the chosen
       function identities and associated function signature must be chosen
       specifically for the operation that it's intended for, as determined by
       the intended OSSL_ALGORITHM(3) array.

       Any function identity not recognised by the recipient of this type will
       be ignored.  This ensures that providers built with one OpenSSL version
       in mind will work together with any other OpenSSL version that supports
       this mechanism.
