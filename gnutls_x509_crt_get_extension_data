NAME
       gnutls_x509_crt_get_extension_data - API function

SYNOPSIS
       #include <gnutls/x509.h>

       int gnutls_x509_crt_get_extension_data(gnutls_x509_crt_t cert, unsigned indx, void * data, size_t * sizeof_data);

ARGUMENTS
       gnutls_x509_crt_t cert
                   should contain a gnutls_x509_crt_t type

       unsigned indx
                   Specifies which extension OID to send. Use (0) to get the first one.

       void * data a pointer to a structure to hold the data (may be null)

       size_t * sizeof_data
                   initially holds the size of  data

DESCRIPTION
       This function will return the requested extension data in the certificate.  The extension data will be stored in the provided buffer.

       Use  gnutls_x509_crt_get_extension_info()  to  extract  the OID and critical flag.  Use gnutls_x509_crt_get_extension_by_oid() instead, if you want to get data indexed by the extension OID rather
       than sequence.

RETURNS
       On success, GNUTLS_E_SUCCESS (0) is returned, otherwise a negative error code is returned.  If you have reached the last extension  available  GNUTLS_E_REQUESTED_DATA_NOT_AVAILABLE  will  be  re‐
       turned.
