NAME
       ldns_rr_compare, ldns_rr_compare_ds - compare a ldns_rr

SYNOPSIS
       #include <stdint.h>
       #include <stdbool.h>

       #include <ldns/ldns.h>

       int ldns_rr_compare(const ldns_rr *rr1, const ldns_rr *rr2);

       bool ldns_rr_compare_ds(const ldns_rr *rr1, const ldns_rr *rr2);

DESCRIPTION
       ldns_rr_compare() compares two rrs. The TTL is not looked at.
              rr1: the first one
              rr2: the second one
              Returns 0 if equal -1 if rr1 comes before rr2 +1 if rr2 comes before rr1

       ldns_rr_compare_ds() returns true of the given rr's are equal.  Also returns true if one record is a DS that represents the same DNSKEY record as the other record
              rr1: the first rr
              rr2: the second rr
              Returns true if equal otherwise false
