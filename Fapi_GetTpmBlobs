Detailed Description
       FAPI functions to invoke GetTPMBlobs either as one-call or in an asynchronous manner.

Function Documentation
   Fapi_GetTpmBlobs (FAPI_CONTEXT * context, char const * path, uint8_t ** tpm2bPublic, size_t * tpm2bPublicSize, uint8_t ** tpm2bPrivate, size_t * tpm2bPrivateSize, char ** policy)
       One-Call function for Fapi_GetTpmBlobs

       Get the public and private blobs of a TPM object. They can be loaded with a lower-level API such as the SAPI or the ESAPI.

       Parameters
           context The FAPI_CONTEXT
           path The path to the key for which the blobs will be returned
           tpm2bPublic The returned public area of the object. May be NULL
           tpm2bPublicSize The size of tpm2bPublic in bytes. May be NULL
           tpm2bPrivate The returned private area of the object. May be NULL
           tpm2bPrivateSize The size of tpm2bPrivate in bytes. May be NULL
           policy The policy that is associated with the object encoded in JSON. May be NULL

       Return values
           TSS2_RC_SUCCESS if the function call was a success.
           TSS2_FAPI_RC_BAD_REFERENCE if context or path is NULL.
           TSS2_FAPI_RC_BAD_CONTEXT if context corruption is detected.
           TSS2_FAPI_RC_BAD_PATH if path does not map to a FAPI entity.
           TSS2_FAPI_RC_BAD_SEQUENCE if the context has an asynchronous operation already pending.
           TSS2_FAPI_RC_IO_ERROR if the data cannot be saved.
           TSS2_FAPI_RC_MEMORY if the FAPI cannot allocate enough memory for internal operations or return parameters.
           TSS2_FAPI_RC_PATH_NOT_FOUND if a FAPI object path was not found during authorization.
           TSS2_FAPI_RC_KEY_NOT_FOUND if a key was not found.
           TSS2_FAPI_RC_BAD_VALUE if an invalid value was passed into the function.
           TSS2_FAPI_RC_TRY_AGAIN if an I/O operation is not finished yet and this function needs to be called again.
           TSS2_FAPI_RC_GENERAL_FAILURE if an internal error occurred.
           TSS2_FAPI_RC_NOT_PROVISIONED FAPI was not provisioned.

   Fapi_GetTpmBlobs_Async (FAPI_CONTEXT * context, char const * path)
       Asynchronous function for Fapi_GetTpmBlobs

       Get the public and private blobs of a TPM object. They can be loaded with a lower-level API such as the SAPI or the ESAPI.

       Call Fapi_GetTpmBlobs_Finish to finish the execution of this command.

       Parameters
           context The FAPI_CONTEXT
           path The path to the key for which the blobs will be returned

       Return values
           TSS2_RC_SUCCESS if the function call was a success.
           TSS2_FAPI_RC_BAD_REFERENCE if context or path is NULL.
           TSS2_FAPI_RC_BAD_CONTEXT if context corruption is detected.
           TSS2_FAPI_RC_BAD_PATH if path does not map to a FAPI entity.
           TSS2_FAPI_RC_BAD_SEQUENCE if the context has an asynchronous operation already pending.
           TSS2_FAPI_RC_IO_ERROR if the data cannot be saved.
           TSS2_FAPI_RC_MEMORY if the FAPI cannot allocate enough memory for internal operations or return parameters.
           TSS2_FAPI_RC_PATH_NOT_FOUND if a FAPI object path was not found during authorization.
           TSS2_FAPI_RC_KEY_NOT_FOUND if a key was not found.
           TSS2_FAPI_RC_BAD_VALUE if an invalid value was passed into the function.
           TSS2_FAPI_RC_NOT_PROVISIONED FAPI was not provisioned.

   Fapi_GetTpmBlobs_Finish (FAPI_CONTEXT * context, uint8_t ** tpm2bPublic, size_t * tpm2bPublicSize, uint8_t ** tpm2bPrivate, size_t * tpm2bPrivateSize, char ** policy)
       Asynchronous finish function for Fapi_GetTpmBlobs

       This function should be called after a previous Fapi_GetTpmBlobs_Async.

       Parameters
           context The FAPI_CONTEXT
           tpm2bPublic The returned public area of the object. May be NULL
           tpm2bPublicSize The size of tpm2bPublic in bytes. May be NULL
           tpm2bPrivate The returned private area of the object. May be NULL
           tpm2bPrivateSize The size of tpm2bPrivate in bytes. May be NULL
           policy The policy that is associated with the object encoded in JSON. May be NULL

       Return values
           TSS2_RC_SUCCESS if the function call was a success.
           TSS2_FAPI_RC_BAD_REFERENCE if context is NULL.
           TSS2_FAPI_RC_BAD_CONTEXT if context corruption is detected.
           TSS2_FAPI_RC_BAD_SEQUENCE if the context has an asynchronous operation already pending.
           TSS2_FAPI_RC_IO_ERROR if the data cannot be saved.
           TSS2_FAPI_RC_MEMORY if the FAPI cannot allocate enough memory for internal operations or return parameters.
           TSS2_FAPI_RC_TRY_AGAIN if the asynchronous operation is not yet complete. Call this function again later.
           TSS2_FAPI_RC_BAD_PATH if a path is used in inappropriate context or contains illegal characters.
           TSS2_FAPI_RC_GENERAL_FAILURE if an internal error occurred.
           TSS2_FAPI_RC_BAD_VALUE if an invalid value was passed into the function.
