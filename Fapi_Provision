NAME
       Fapi_Provision - Fapi_Provision

SYNOPSIS
   Functions
       TSS2_RC Fapi_Provision (FAPI_CONTEXT *context, char const *authValueEh, char const *authValueSh, char const *authValueLockout)
       TSS2_RC Fapi_Provision_Async (FAPI_CONTEXT *context, char const *authValueEh, char const *authValueSh, char const *authValueLockout)
       TSS2_RC Fapi_Provision_Finish (FAPI_CONTEXT *context)

Detailed Description
       FAPI functions to invoke Provision either as one-call or in an asynchronous manner.

Function Documentation
   Fapi_Provision (FAPI_CONTEXT * context, char const * authValueEh, char const * authValueSh, char const * authValueLockout)
       One-Call function for the initial FAPI provisioning.

       Provisions a TSS with its TPM. This includes the setting of important passwords and policy settings as well as the readout of the EK and its certificate and the initialization of the system-wide
       keystore.

       Parameters
           context The FAPI_CONTEXT.
           authValueEh The authorization value for the endorsement hierarchy. May be NULL
           authValueSh The authorization value for the storage hierarchy. Should be NULL
           authValueLockout The authorization value for lockout.

       Return values
           TSS2_RC_SUCCESS if the function call was a success.
           TSS2_FAPI_RC_BAD_REFERENCE if context is NULL.
           TSS2_FAPI_RC_BAD_CONTEXT if context corruption is detected.
           TSS2_FAPI_RC_BAD_SEQUENCE if the context has an asynchronous operation already pending.
           TSS2_FAPI_RC_NO_CERT if no certificate was found for the computed EK.
           TSS2_FAPI_RC_BAD_KEY if public key of the EK does not match the configured certificate or the configured fingerprint does not match the computed EK.
           TSS2_FAPI_RC_IO_ERROR if the data cannot be saved.
           TSS2_FAPI_RC_MEMORY if the FAPI cannot allocate enough memory for internal operations or return parameters.
           TSS2_FAPI_RC_NO_TPM if FAPI was initialized in no-TPM-mode via its config file.
           TSS2_FAPI_RC_TRY_AGAIN if an I/O operation is not finished yet and this function needs to be called again.
           TSS2_FAPI_RC_BAD_VALUE if an invalid value was passed into the function.
           TSS2_FAPI_RC_AUTHORIZATION_UNKNOWN if a required authorization callback is not set.
           TSS2_FAPI_RC_AUTHORIZATION_FAILED if the authorization attempt fails.
           TSS2_FAPI_RC_GENERAL_FAILURE if an internal error occurred.
           TSS2_FAPI_RC_POLICY_UNKNOWN if policy search for a certain policy digest was not successful.
           TSS2_FAPI_RC_PATH_NOT_FOUND if a FAPI object path was not found during authorization.
           TSS2_FAPI_RC_KEY_NOT_FOUND if a key was not found.
           TSS2_ESYS_RC_* possible error codes of ESAPI.
           TSS2_FAPI_RC_BAD_PATH if the path is used in inappropriate context or contains illegal characters.
           TSS2_FAPI_RC_NOT_PROVISIONED FAPI was not provisioned.
           TSS2_FAPI_RC_PATH_ALREADY_EXISTS if the object already exists in object store.

   Fapi_Provision_Async (FAPI_CONTEXT * context, char const * authValueEh, char const * authValueSh, char const * authValueLockout)
       Asynchronous function for the initial FAPI provisioning.

       Provisions a TSS with its TPM. This includes the setting of important passwords and policy settings as well as the readout of the EK and its certificate and the initialization of the system-wide
       keystore.

       Call Fapi_Provision_Finish to finish the execution of this command.

       Parameters
           context The FAPI_CONTEXT.
           authValueEh The authorization value for the endorsement hierarchy. May be NULL
           authValueSh The authorization value for the storage hierarchy. Should be NULL
           authValueLockout The authorization value for lockout.

       Return values
           TSS2_RC_SUCCESS if the function call was a success.
           TSS2_FAPI_RC_BAD_REFERENCE if context is NULL.
           TSS2_FAPI_RC_BAD_CONTEXT if context corruption is detected.
           TSS2_FAPI_RC_BAD_SEQUENCE if the context has an asynchronous operation already pending.
           TSS2_FAPI_RC_IO_ERROR if the data cannot be saved.
           TSS2_FAPI_RC_MEMORY if the FAPI cannot allocate enough memory for internal operations or return parameters.
           TSS2_FAPI_RC_NO_TPM if FAPI was initialized in no-TPM-mode via its config file.
           TSS2_FAPI_RC_BAD_VALUE if an invalid value was passed into the function.
           TSS2_FAPI_RC_BAD_PATH if the path is used in inappropriate context or contains illegal characters.
           TSS2_FAPI_RC_PATH_NOT_FOUND if a FAPI object path was not found during authorization.

   Fapi_Provision_Finish (FAPI_CONTEXT * context)
       Asynchronous finish function for Fapi_Provision

       This function should be called after a previous Fapi_Provision_Async.

           TSS2_FAPI_RC_IO_ERROR if the data cannot be saved.
           TSS2_FAPI_RC_MEMORY if the FAPI cannot allocate enough memory for internal operations or return parameters.
