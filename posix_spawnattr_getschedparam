PROLOG
       This  manual  page is part of the POSIX Programmer's Manual.  The Linux
       implementation of this interface may differ (consult the  corresponding
       Linux  manual page for details of Linux behavior), or the interface may
       not be implemented on Linux.

NAME
       posix_spawnattr_getschedparam, posix_spawnattr_setschedparam — get  and
       set  the  spawn-schedparam  attribute of a spawn attributes object (AD‐
       VANCED REALTIME)

SYNOPSIS
       #include <spawn.h>
       #include <sched.h>

       int posix_spawnattr_getschedparam(const posix_spawnattr_t
           *restrict attr, struct sched_param *restrict schedparam);
       int posix_spawnattr_setschedparam(posix_spawnattr_t *restrict attr,
           const struct sched_param *restrict schedparam);

DESCRIPTION
       The posix_spawnattr_getschedparam() function shall obtain the value  of
       the spawn-schedparam attribute from the attributes object referenced by
       attr.

       The posix_spawnattr_setschedparam() function shall set the spawn-sched‐
       param attribute in an initialized attributes object referenced by attr.

       The  spawn-schedparam attribute represents the scheduling parameters to
       be assigned  to  the  new  process  image  in  a  spawn  operation  (if
       POSIX_SPAWN_SETSCHEDULER  or  POSIX_SPAWN_SETSCHEDPARAM  is  set in the
       spawn-flags attribute). The default value of this attribute is unspeci‐
       fied.

RETURN VALUE
       Upon  successful  completion, posix_spawnattr_getschedparam() shall re‐
       turn zero and store the value of the spawn-schedparam attribute of attr
       into  the  object referenced by the schedparam parameter; otherwise, an
       error number shall be returned to indicate the error.

       Upon successful completion, posix_spawnattr_setschedparam()  shall  re‐
       turn zero; otherwise, an error number shall be returned to indicate the
       error.

ERRORS
       These functions may fail if:

       EINVAL The value specified by attr is invalid.

       The posix_spawnattr_setschedparam() function may fail if:

       EINVAL The value of the attribute being set is not valid.

       The following sections are informative.

EXAMPLES
       None.

APPLICATION USAGE
       These functions are part of the Spawn and  Process  Scheduling  options
       and need not be provided on all implementations.

RATIONALE
       None.

FUTURE DIRECTIONS
       None.
