NAME
       XkbResizeDeviceButtonActions - Allocate additional space for button actions in an XkbDeviceInfoRec structure

SYNOPSIS
       Status XkbResizeDeviceButtonActions (XkbDeviceInfoPtr device_info, unsigned int new_total);

ARGUMENTS
       device_info
              structure in which to allocate button actions

       new_total
              new total number of button actions needed

DESCRIPTION
       XkbResizeDeviceButtonActions  reallocates  space,  if necessary, to make sure there is room for a total of new_total button actions in the device_info structure. Any new entries allocated are ze‐
       roed. If successful, XkbResizeDeviceButtonActions returns Success. If new_total is zero, all button actions are deleted, device_info->num_btns is set to zero, and device_info->btn_acts is set  to
       NULL. If device_info is invalid or new_total is greater than 255, BadValue is returned. If a memory allocation failure occurs, a BadAlloc is returned.

STRUCTURES
       Information about X Input Extension devices is transferred between a client program and the Xkb extension in an XkbDeviceInfoRec structure:

           typedef struct {
               char *               name;          /* name for device */
               Atom                 type;          /* name for class of devices */
               unsigned short       device_spec;   /* device of interest */
               Bool                 has_own_state; /* True=>this device has its own state */
               unsigned short       supported;     /* bits indicating supported capabilities */
               unsigned short       unsupported;   /* bits indicating unsupported capabilities */
               unsigned short       num_btns;      /* number of entries in btn_acts */
               XkbAction *          btn_acts;      /* button actions */
               unsigned short       sz_leds;       /* total number of entries in LEDs vector */
               unsigned short       num_leds;      /* number of valid entries in LEDs vector */
               unsigned short       dflt_kbd_fb;   /* input extension ID of default (core kbd) indicator */
               unsigned short       dflt_led_fb;   /* input extension ID of default indicator feedback */
               XkbDeviceLedInfoPtr  leds;          /* LED descriptions */
           } XkbDeviceInfoRec, *XkbDeviceInfoPtr;
