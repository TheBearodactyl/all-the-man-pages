NAME
       kbuildsycoca5 - Rebuilds the KService desktop file system configuration cache

SYNOPSIS

                     kbuildsycoca5
                      [OPTIONS...]

DESCRIPTION
       kbuildsycoca5 builds binary cache of the data stored in .desktop and MIME type .xml files that the KService framework uses to find plugins, applications and other services.

       The KService library uses this database to efficiently provide the information requested of it.

       Users do not normally need to run this application directly; KService will run it if necessary, when any of the files whose data is cached are changed.

OPTIONS
       --global

           Ignores any user-set files (in XDG_DATA_HOME). This is currently only supported on UNIX® systems.

       --noincremental

           Rather than using the existing cache and only updating the information that has changed or been added, start with an empty cache. Ignored if --global is set.

       --nosignal

           Ordinarily, kbuildsycoca5 sends a signal over D-Bus once the cache is updated to all the applications that use KService so that they are always working with the latest information. This
           option suppresses that behaviour.

       --menutest

           Test the generation of the application menu database. Does not actually build the cache.

       --testmode

           Use the QStandardPaths "test mode" to avoid interfering with user data. This is intended for use with unit tests.

       --track menu-id

           Track a menu ID for debugging.

       --author

           Show author information.

       --license

           Show license information.

       -h, --help

           Show a brief help text.

       -v , --version

           Show version information.

FILES
       cachedir/ksycoca5_[lang]_[sha1-of-dirs]

           The KService cache generated by kbuildsycoca5. On UNIX® systems, cachedir is typically XDG_CACHE_HOME.
