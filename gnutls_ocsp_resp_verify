NAME
       gnutls_ocsp_resp_verify - API function

SYNOPSIS
       #include <gnutls/ocsp.h>

       int gnutls_ocsp_resp_verify(gnutls_ocsp_resp_const_t resp, gnutls_x509_trust_list_t trustlist, unsigned int * verify, unsigned int flags);

ARGUMENTS
       gnutls_ocsp_resp_const_t resp
                   should contain a gnutls_ocsp_resp_t type

       gnutls_x509_trust_list_t trustlist
                   trust anchors as a gnutls_x509_trust_list_t type

       unsigned int * verify
                   output variable with verification status, an gnutls_ocsp_verify_reason_t

       unsigned int flags
                   verification flags from gnutls_certificate_verify_flags

DESCRIPTION
       Verify  signature  of the Basic OCSP Response against the public key in the certificate of a trusted signer.  The  trustlist should be populated with trust anchors.  The function will extract the
       signer certificate from the Basic OCSP Response and will verify it against the  trustlist .  A trusted signer is a certificate that is either in  trustlist , or it is signed directly  by  a  cer‐
       tificate in
        trustlist and has the id-ad-ocspSigning Extended Key Usage bit set.

       The  output   verify  variable will hold verification status codes (e.g., GNUTLS_OCSP_VERIFY_SIGNER_NOT_FOUND, GNUTLS_OCSP_VERIFY_INSECURE_ALGORITHM) which are only valid if the function returned
       GNUTLS_E_SUCCESS.

       Note that the function returns GNUTLS_E_SUCCESS even when verification failed.  The caller must always inspect the  verify variable to find out the verification status.

       The  flags variable should be 0 for now.

RETURNS
       On success, GNUTLS_E_SUCCESS (0) is returned, otherwise a negative error value.
