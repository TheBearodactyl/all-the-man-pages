XSetTextProperty(3)                                                                           XLIB FUNCTIONS                                                                           XSetTextProperty(3)

NAME
       XSetTextProperty, XGetTextProperty - set and read text properties

SYNTAX
       void XSetTextProperty(Display *display, Window w, XTextProperty *text_prop, Atom property);

       Status XGetTextProperty(Display *display, Window w, XTextProperty *text_prop_return, Atom property);

ARGUMENTS
       display   Specifies the connection to the X server.

       property  Specifies the property name.

       text_prop Specifies the XTextProperty structure to be used.

       text_prop_return
                 Returns the XTextProperty structure.

DESCRIPTION
       The XSetTextProperty function replaces the existing specified property for the named window with the data, type, format, and number of items determined by the value field, the encoding field, the
       format field, and the nitems field, respectively, of the specified XTextProperty structure.  If the property does not already exist, XSetTextProperty sets it for the specified window.

       XSetTextProperty can generate BadAlloc, BadAtom, BadValue, and BadWindow errors.

       The XGetTextProperty function reads the specified property from the window and stores the data in the returned XTextProperty structure.  It stores the data in the value field,  the  type  of  the
       data  in  the  encoding field, the format of the data in the format field, and the number of items of data in the nitems field.  An extra byte containing null (which is not included in the nitems
       member) is stored at the end of the value field of text_prop_return.  The particular interpretation of the property's encoding and data as text is left to the calling application.  If the  speci‐
       fied property does not exist on the window, XGetTextProperty sets the value field to NULL, the encoding field to None, the format field to zero, and the nitems field to zero.

       If it was able to read and store the data in the XTextProperty structure, XGetTextProperty returns a nonzero status; otherwise, it returns a zero status.

       XGetTextProperty can generate BadAtom and BadWindow errors.

PROPERTIES
       WM_CLIENT_MACHINE
                 The string name of the machine on which the client application is running.

       WM_COMMAND
                 The command and arguments, null-separated, used to invoke the application.

       WM_ICON_NAME
                 The name to be used in an icon.

       WM_NAME   The name of the application.

DIAGNOSTICS
       BadAlloc  The server failed to allocate the requested resource or server memory.

       BadAtom   A value for an Atom argument does not name a defined Atom.

       BadValue  Some numeric value falls outside the range of values accepted by the request.  Unless a specific range is specified for an argument, the full range defined by the argument's type is ac‐
                 cepted.  Any argument defined as a set of alternatives can generate this error.

       BadWindow A value for a Window argument does not name a defined Window.
