NAME
       ldns_key_buf2dsa, ldns_key_buf2rsa - convert buffer to openssl key

SYNOPSIS
       #include <stdint.h>
       #include <stdbool.h>

       #include <ldns/ldns.h>

       DSA* ldns_key_buf2dsa(const ldns_buffer *key);

       RSA* ldns_key_buf2rsa(const ldns_buffer *key);

DESCRIPTION
       ldns_key_buf2dsa() converts a buffer holding key material to a DSA key in openssl.

              key: the key to convert
              Returns a DSA * structure with the key material

       ldns_key_buf2rsa() converts a buffer holding key material to a RSA key in openssl.

              key: the key to convert
              Returns a RSA * structure with the key material
