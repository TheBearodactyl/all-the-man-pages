NAME
       gnutls_x509_crt_get_key_id - API function

SYNOPSIS
       #include <gnutls/x509.h>

       int gnutls_x509_crt_get_key_id(gnutls_x509_crt_t crt, unsigned int flags, unsigned char * output_data, size_t * output_data_size);

ARGUMENTS
       gnutls_x509_crt_t crt
                   Holds the certificate

       unsigned int flags
                   should be one of the flags from gnutls_keyid_flags_t

       unsigned char * output_data
                   will contain the key ID

       size_t * output_data_size
                   holds the size of output_data (and will be replaced by the actual size of parameters)

DESCRIPTION
       This function will return a unique ID that depends on the public key parameters. This ID can be used in checking whether a certificate corresponds to the given private key.

       If  the  buffer provided is not long enough to hold the output, then *output_data_size is updated and GNUTLS_E_SHORT_MEMORY_BUFFER will be returned.  The output will normally be a SHA-1 hash out‐
       put, which is 20 bytes.

RETURNS
       In case of failure a negative error code will be returned, and 0 on success.
