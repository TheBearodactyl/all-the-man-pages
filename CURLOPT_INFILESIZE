NAME
       CURLOPT_INFILESIZE - size of the input file to send off

SYNOPSIS
       #include <curl/curl.h>

       CURLcode curl_easy_setopt(CURL *handle, CURLOPT_INFILESIZE, long filesize);

DESCRIPTION
       When  uploading  a  file  to  a  remote  site,  filesize  should be used to tell libcurl what the expected size of the input file is. This value must be passed as a long. See also CURLOPT_INFILE‚Äê
       SIZE_LARGE(3) for sending files larger than 2GB.

       For uploading using SCP, this option or CURLOPT_INFILESIZE_LARGE(3) is mandatory.

       To unset this value again, set it to -1.

       When sending emails using SMTP, this command can be used to specify the optional SIZE parameter for the MAIL FROM command.

       This option does not limit how much data libcurl will actually send, as that is controlled entirely by what the read callback returns, but telling one value and sending  a  different  amount  may
       lead to errors.

DEFAULT
       Unset

PROTOCOLS
       Many

EXAMPLE
       CURL *curl = curl_easy_init();
       if(curl) {
         long uploadsize = FILE_SIZE;

         curl_easy_setopt(curl, CURLOPT_URL, "ftp://example.com/destination.tar.gz");

         curl_easy_setopt(curl, CURLOPT_UPLOAD, 1L);

         curl_easy_setopt(curl, CURLOPT_INFILESIZE, uploadsize);

         curl_easy_perform(curl);
       }

AVAILABILITY
       SMTP support added in 7.23.0

RETURN VALUE
       Returns CURLE_OK if the option is supported, and CURLE_UNKNOWN_OPTION if not.
