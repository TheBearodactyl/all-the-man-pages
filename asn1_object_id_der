NAME
       asn1_object_id_der - API function

SYNOPSIS
       #include <libtasn1.h>

       int asn1_object_id_der(const char * str, unsigned char * der, int * der_len, unsigned flags);

ARGUMENTS
       const char * str
                   An object identifier in numeric, dot format.

       unsigned char * der
                   buffer to hold the returned encoding (may be NULL).

       int * der_len
                   initially the size of  der ; will hold the final size.

       unsigned flags
                   must be zero

DESCRIPTION
       Creates the DER encoding of the provided object identifier.

RETURNS
       ASN1_SUCCESS if DER encoding was OK, ASN1_VALUE_NOT_VALID if  str is not a valid OID, ASN1_MEM_ERROR if the  der vector isn't big enough and in this case  der_len will contain the length needed.
