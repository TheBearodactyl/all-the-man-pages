NAME
       CURLMOPT_CHUNK_LENGTH_PENALTY_SIZE - chunk length threshold for pipelining

SYNOPSIS
       #include <curl/curl.h>

       CURLMcode curl_multi_setopt(CURLM *handle, CURLMOPT_CHUNK_LENGTH_PENALTY_SIZE,
                                   long size);

DESCRIPTION
       No function since pipelining was removed in 7.62.0.

       Pass  a  long  with  a  size  in  bytes.  If  a  transfer  in  a  pipeline  is  currently  processing  a chunked (Transfer-encoding: chunked) request with a current chunk length larger than CURL‚Äê
       MOPT_CHUNK_LENGTH_PENALTY_SIZE(3), that pipeline will not be considered for additional requests, even if it is shorter than CURLMOPT_MAX_PIPELINE_LENGTH(3).

DEFAULT
       The default value is 0, which means that the penalization is inactive.

PROTOCOLS
       HTTP(S)

EXAMPLE
       CURLM *m = curl_multi_init();
       long maxchunk = 10000;
       curl_multi_setopt(m, CURLMOPT_CHUNK_LENGTH_PENALTY_SIZE, maxchunk);

AVAILABILITY
       Added in 7.30.0

RETURN VALUE
       Returns CURLM_OK if the option is supported, and CURLM_UNKNOWN_OPTION if not.
