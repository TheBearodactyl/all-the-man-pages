NAME
       EVP_sha1 - SHA-1 For EVP

SYNOPSIS
        #include <openssl/evp.h>

        const EVP_MD *EVP_sha1(void);

DESCRIPTION
       SHA-1 (Secure Hash Algorithm 1) is a cryptographic hash function standardized in NIST FIPS 180-4. The algorithm was designed by the United States National Security Agency and initially published
       in 1995.

       EVP_sha1()
           The SHA-1 algorithm which produces a 160-bit output from a given input.

RETURN VALUES
       These functions return a EVP_MD structure that contains the implementation of the message digest. See EVP_MD_meth_new(3) for details of the EVP_MD structure.

CONFORMING TO
       NIST FIPS 180-4.
