NAME
       TIFFCustomTagList - returns information about the custom tag list

SYNOPSIS
          #include <tiffio.h>

       int TIFFGetTagListCount(TIFF *tif)

       uint32_t TIFFGetTagListEntry(TIFF *tif, int tag_index)

DESCRIPTION
       TIFFGetTagListCount() returns the number of entries in the custom tag list.

       TIFFGetTagListEntry()  returns  the  tag  number  of  the  (n.th  -  1)  entry within the custom tag list.  If the tag_index is larger or equal to the number of entries in the tag list 0xFFFFFFFF
       (=(uint32_t(-1)) is returned.

NOTE
       The known tags to libtiff are define as ‘named’ tags and a lot of them as custom tags. The custom tag definitions are handled in an internal custom tag list. This list can  also  be  extended  by
       adding tag definitions to that list, so that libtiff is aware of those tags.  See Defining Application Tags

DIAGNOSTICS
       none
