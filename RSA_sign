RSA_SIGN(3ssl)                      OpenSSL                     RSA_SIGN(3ssl)

NAME
       RSA_sign, RSA_verify - RSA signatures

SYNOPSIS
        #include <openssl/rsa.h>

       The following functions have been deprecated since OpenSSL 3.0, and can
       be hidden entirely by defining OPENSSL_API_COMPAT with a suitable
       version value, see openssl_user_macros(7):

        int RSA_sign(int type, const unsigned char *m, unsigned int m_len,
                     unsigned char *sigret, unsigned int *siglen, RSA *rsa);

        int RSA_verify(int type, const unsigned char *m, unsigned int m_len,
                       unsigned char *sigbuf, unsigned int siglen, RSA *rsa);

DESCRIPTION
       All of the functions described on this page are deprecated.
       Applications should instead use EVP_PKEY_sign_init(3),
       EVP_PKEY_sign(3), EVP_PKEY_verify_init(3) and EVP_PKEY_verify(3).

       RSA_sign() signs the message digest m of size m_len using the private
       key rsa using RSASSA-PKCS1-v1_5 as specified in RFC 3447. It stores the
       signature in sigret and the signature size in siglen.  sigret must
       point to RSA_size(rsa) bytes of memory.  Note that PKCS #1 adds meta-
       data, placing limits on the size of the key that can be used.  See
       RSA_private_encrypt(3) for lower-level operations.

       type denotes the message digest algorithm that was used to generate m.
       If type is NID_md5_sha1, an SSL signature (MD5 and SHA1 message digests
       with PKCS #1 padding and no algorithm identifier) is created.

       RSA_verify() verifies that the signature sigbuf of size siglen matches
       a given message digest m of size m_len. type denotes the message digest
       algorithm that was used to generate the signature.  rsa is the signer's
       public key.

RETURN VALUES
       RSA_sign() returns 1 on success and 0 for failure.  RSA_verify()
       returns 1 on successful verification and 0 for failure.

       The error codes can be obtained by ERR_get_error(3).

CONFORMING TO
       SSL, PKCS #1 v2.0

HISTORY
       All of these functions were deprecated in OpenSSL 3.0.
