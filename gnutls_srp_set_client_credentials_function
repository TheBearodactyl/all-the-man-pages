NAME
       gnutls_srp_set_client_credentials_function - API function

SYNOPSIS
       #include <gnutls/gnutls.h>

       void gnutls_srp_set_client_credentials_function(gnutls_srp_client_credentials_t         cred, gnutls_srp_client_credentials_function         * func);

ARGUMENTS
       gnutls_srp_client_credentials_t         cred
                   is a gnutls_srp_server_credentials_t type.

       gnutls_srp_client_credentials_function         * func
                   is the callback function

DESCRIPTION
       This function can be used to set a callback to retrieve the username and password for client SRP authentication.  The callback's function form is:

       int (*callback)(gnutls_session_t, char** username, char**password);

       The  username and  password must be allocated using gnutls_malloc().

       The   username  should  be  an ASCII string or UTF-8 string. In case of a UTF-8 string it is recommended to be following the PRECIS framework for usernames (rfc8265). The password can be in ASCII
       format, or normalized using gnutls_utf8_password_normalize().

       The callback function will be called once per handshake before the initial hello message is sent.

       The callback should not return a negative error code the second time called, since the handshake procedure will be aborted.

       The callback function should return 0 on success.  -1 indicates an error.
