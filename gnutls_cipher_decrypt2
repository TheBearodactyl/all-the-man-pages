NAME
       gnutls_cipher_decrypt2 - API function

SYNOPSIS
       #include <gnutls/crypto.h>

       int gnutls_cipher_decrypt2(gnutls_cipher_hd_t handle, const void * ctext, size_t ctext_len, void * ptext, size_t ptext_len);

ARGUMENTS
       gnutls_cipher_hd_t handle
                   is a gnutls_cipher_hd_t type

       const void * ctext
                   the data to decrypt

       size_t ctext_len
                   the length of data to decrypt

       void * ptext
                   the decrypted data

       size_t ptext_len
                   the available length for decrypted data

DESCRIPTION
       This function will decrypt the given data using the algorithm specified by the context. For block ciphers the  ctext_len must be a multiple of the block size. For the supported ciphers the plain‐
       text data length will equal the ciphertext size.

       Note that in AEAD ciphers, this will not check the tag. You will need to compare the tag sent with the value returned from gnutls_cipher_tag().

RETURNS
       Zero or a negative error code on error.

SINCE
       2.12.0
