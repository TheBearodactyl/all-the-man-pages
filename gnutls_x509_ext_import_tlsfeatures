NAME
       gnutls_x509_ext_import_tlsfeatures - API function

SYNOPSIS
       #include <gnutls/x509-ext.h>

       int gnutls_x509_ext_import_tlsfeatures(const gnutls_datum_t * ext, gnutls_x509_tlsfeatures_t f, unsigned int flags);

ARGUMENTS
       const gnutls_datum_t * ext
                   The DER-encoded extension data

       gnutls_x509_tlsfeatures_t f
                   The features structure

       unsigned int flags
                   zero or GNUTLS_EXT_FLAG_APPEND

DESCRIPTION
       This function will export the features in the provided DER-encoded TLS Features PKIX extension, to a gnutls_x509_tlsfeatures_t type.  f must be initialized.

       When the  flags is set to GNUTLS_EXT_FLAG_APPEND, then if the  features structure is empty this function will behave identically as if the flag was not set. Otherwise if there are elements in the
       features structure then they will be merged with.

RETURNS
       On success, GNUTLS_E_SUCCESS (0) is returned, otherwise a negative error value.

SINCE
       3.5.1
