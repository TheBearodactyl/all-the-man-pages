PCAP_IS_SWAPPED(3PCAP)                                  PCAP_IS_SWAPPED(3PCAP)

NAME
       pcap_is_swapped - find out whether a savefile has the native byte order

SYNOPSIS
       #include <pcap/pcap.h>

       int pcap_is_swapped(pcap_t *p);

DESCRIPTION
       pcap_is_swapped()  returns  true (1) if p refers to a ``savefile'' that
       uses a different byte order than the current system.  For a  live  cap‐
       ture, it always returns false (0).

       It   must   not   be   called   on   a   pcap   descriptor  created  by
       pcap_create(3PCAP)   that   has   not    yet    been    activated    by
       pcap_activate(3PCAP).

RETURN VALUE
       pcap_is_swapped() returns true (1) or false (0) on success and PCAP_ER‐
       ROR_NOT_ACTIVATED if called on a capture handle that has  been  created
       but not activated.
