NAME
       CURLINFO_LOCAL_IP - get local IP address of last connection

SYNOPSIS
       #include <curl/curl.h>

       CURLcode curl_easy_getinfo(CURL *handle, CURLINFO_LOCAL_IP, char **ip);

DESCRIPTION
       Pass  a  pointer to a char pointer to receive the pointer to a null-terminated string holding the IP address of the local end of most recent connection done with this curl handle. This string may
       be IPv6 when that is enabled. Note that you get a pointer to a memory area that will be re-used at next request so you need to copy the string if you want to keep the information.

       The ip pointer will be NULL or pointing to private memory you MUST NOT free - it gets freed when you call curl_easy_cleanup(3) on the corresponding CURL handle.

PROTOCOLS
       All

EXAMPLE
       {
         char *ip;

         curl_easy_setopt(curl, CURLOPT_URL, "https://example.com");

         /* Perform the request, res will get the return code */
         res = curl_easy_perform(curl);
         /* Check for errors */
         if((res == CURLE_OK) &&
            !curl_easy_getinfo(curl, CURLINFO_LOCAL_IP, &ip) && ip) {
           printf("Local IP: %s\n", ip);
         }

         /* always cleanup */
         curl_easy_cleanup(curl);
       }

AVAILABILITY
       Added in 7.21.0

RETURN VALUE
       Returns CURLE_OK if the option is supported, and CURLE_UNKNOWN_OPTION if not.
