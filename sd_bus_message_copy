NAME
       sd_bus_message_copy - Copy the contents of one message to another

SYNOPSIS
       #include <systemd/sd-bus.h>

       int sd_bus_message_copy(sd_bus_message *m, sd_bus_message *source,
                               int all);

DESCRIPTION
       sd_bus_message_copy() copies the contents from message source to m. If
       all is false, a single complete type is copied (basic or container). If
       all is true, the contents are copied until the end of the currently
       open container or the end of source.

RETURN VALUE
       On success, this call returns true if anything was copied, and false if
       there was nothing to copy. On failure, it returns a negative
       errno-style error code.

   Errors
       Returned errors may indicate the following problems:

       -EINVAL
           source or m are NULL.

       -EPERM
           Message m has been sealed or source has not been sealed.

       -ESTALE
           Destination message is in invalid state.

       -ENXIO
           Destination message cannot be appended to.

       -ENOMEM
           Memory allocation failed.

NOTES
       These APIs are implemented as a shared library, which can be compiled
       and linked to with the libsystemd pkg-config(1) file.
