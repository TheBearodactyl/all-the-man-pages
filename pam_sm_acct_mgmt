PAM_SM_ACCT_MGMT(3)            Linux-PAM Manual            PAM_SM_ACCT_MGMT(3)

NAME
       pam_sm_acct_mgmt - PAM service function for account management

SYNOPSIS
       #include <security/pam_modules.h>

       int pam_sm_acct_mgmt(pam_handle_t *pamh, int flags, int argc,
                            const char **argv);

DESCRIPTION
       The pam_sm_acct_mgmt function is the service module's implementation of
       the pam_acct_mgmt(3) interface.

       This function performs the task of establishing whether the user is
       permitted to gain access at this time. It should be understood that the
       user has previously been validated by an authentication module. This
       function checks for other things. Such things might be: the time of day
       or the date, the terminal line, remote hostname, etc. This function may
       also determine things like the expiration on passwords, and respond
       that the user change it before continuing.

       Valid flags, which may be logically OR'd with PAM_SILENT, are:

       PAM_SILENT
           Do not emit any messages.

       PAM_DISALLOW_NULL_AUTHTOK
           Return PAM_AUTH_ERR if the database of authentication tokens for
           this authentication mechanism has a NULL entry for the user.

RETURN VALUES
       PAM_ACCT_EXPIRED
           User account has expired.

       PAM_AUTH_ERR
           Authentication failure.

       PAM_NEW_AUTHTOK_REQD
           The user's authentication token has expired. Before calling this
           function again the application will arrange for a new one to be
           given. This will likely result in a call to pam_sm_chauthtok().

       PAM_PERM_DENIED
           Permission denied.

       PAM_SUCCESS
           The authentication token was successfully updated.

       PAM_USER_UNKNOWN
           User unknown to password service.
