NAME
       MPI_Comm_delete_attr - Deletes attribute value associated with a key.

SYNTAX
C Syntax
       #include <mpi.h>
       int MPI_Comm_delete_attr(MPI_Comm comm, int comm_keyval)

Fortran Syntax
       USE MPI
       ! or the older form: INCLUDE 'mpif.h'
       MPI_COMM_DELETE_ATTR(COMM, COMM_KEYVAL, IERROR)
            INTEGER   COMM, COMM_KEYVAL, IERROR

Fortran 2008 Syntax
       USE mpi_f08
       MPI_Comm_delete_attr(comm, comm_keyval, ierror)
            TYPE(MPI_Comm), INTENT(IN) :: comm
            INTEGER, INTENT(IN) :: comm_keyval
            INTEGER, OPTIONAL, INTENT(OUT) :: ierror

C++ Syntax
       #include <mpi.h>
       void MPI::Comm::Delete_attr(int comm_keyval)

INPUT/OUTPUT PARAMETER
       comm      Communicator from which the attribute is deleted (handle).

INPUT PARAMETER
       comm_keyval
                 Key value (integer).

OUTPUT PARAMETER
       IERROR    Fortran only: Error status (integer).

DESCRIPTION
       MPI_Comm_delete_attr  deletes  an  attribute from cache by key. This function invokes the attribute delete function delete_fn specified when the comm_keyval was created. The call will fail if the
       delete_fn function returns an error code other than MPI_SUCCESS.

       Whenever a communicator is replicated using the function MPI_Comm_dup, all callback copy functions for attributes that are currently set are invoked (in arbitrary order). Whenever a  communicator
       is deleted using the function MPI_Comm_free, all callback delete functions for attributes that are currently set are invoked.

       This function is the same as MPI_Attr_delete but is needed to match the communicator-specific functions introduced in the MPI-2 standard. The use of MPI_Attr_delete is deprecated.

NOTES
       Note  that  it  is not defined by the MPI standard what happens if the delete_fn callback invokes other MPI functions.  In Open MPI, it is not valid for delete_fn callbacks (or any of their chil‚Äê
       dren) to add or delete attributes on the same object on which the delete_fn callback is being invoked.

ERRORS
       Almost all MPI routines return an error value; C routines as the value of the function and Fortran routines in the last argument. C++ functions do not return errors. If the default error  handler
       is set to MPI::ERRORS_THROW_EXCEPTIONS, then on error the C++ exception mechanism will be used to throw an MPI::Exception object.

       Before  the  error  value is returned, the current MPI error handler is called. By default, this error handler aborts the MPI job, except for I/O function errors. The error handler may be changed
       with MPI_Comm_set_errhandler; the predefined error handler MPI_ERRORS_RETURN may be used to cause error values to be returned. Note that MPI does not guarantee that an MPI  program  can  continue
       past an error.
