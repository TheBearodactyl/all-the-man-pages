NAME
     acl_delete_def_file — delete a default ACL by filename

LIBRARY
     Linux Access Control Lists library (libacl, -lacl).

SYNOPSIS
     #include <sys/types.h>
     #include <sys/acl.h>

     int
     acl_delete_def_file(const char *path_p);

DESCRIPTION
     The acl_delete_def_file() function deletes a default ACL from the directory whose pathname is pointed to by the argument path_p.

     The effective user ID of the process must match the owner of the file or directory or the process must have the CAP_FOWNER capability for the request to succeed.

     If the argument path_p is not a directory, then the function fails. It is no error if the directory whose pathname is pointed to by the argument path_p does not have a default ACL.

RETURN VALUE
     The acl_delete_def_file() function returns the value 0 if successful; otherwise the value -1 is returned and the global variable errno is set to indicate the error.

ERRORS
     If any of the following conditions occur, the acl_delete_def_file() function returns the value -1 and and sets errno to the corresponding value:

     [EINVAL]           The file referred to by path_p is not a directory.

     [ENOTSUP]          The file system on which the file identified by path_p is located does not support ACLs, or ACLs are disabled.

     [EPERM]            The process does not have appropriate privilege to perform the operation to delete the default ACL.

     [EROFS]            This function requires modification of a file system which is currently read-only.

STANDARDS
     IEEE Std 1003.1e draft 17 (“POSIX.1e”, abandoned)
