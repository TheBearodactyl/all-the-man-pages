NAME
       gnutls_kx_get - API function

SYNOPSIS
       #include <gnutls/gnutls.h>

       gnutls_kx_algorithm_t gnutls_kx_get(gnutls_session_t session);

ARGUMENTS
       gnutls_session_t session
                   is a gnutls_session_t type.

DESCRIPTION
       Get the currently used key exchange algorithm.

       This  function  will  return  GNUTLS_KX_ECDHE_RSA,  or GNUTLS_KX_DHE_RSA under TLS 1.3, to indicate an elliptic curve DH key exchange or a finite field one. The precise group used is available by
       calling gnutls_group_get() instead.

RETURNS
       the key exchange algorithm used in the last handshake, a gnutls_kx_algorithm_t value.
