NAME
       TIFFWriteRawTile - write a tile of raw data to an open TIFF file

SYNOPSIS
          #include <tiffio.h>

       tsize_t TIFFWriteRawTile(TIFF *tif, ttile_t tile, tdata_t buf, tsize_tsize)

DESCRIPTION
       Append size bytes of raw data to the specified tile.

RETURN VALUES
       -1 is returned if an error occurred. Otherwise, the value of size is returned.

DIAGNOSTICS
       All error messages are directed to the TIFFErrorExtR() routine.

       %s: File not open for writing:
          The file was opened for reading, not writing.

       Can not write tiles to a stripped image:
          The image is assumed to be organized in strips because neither of the TileWidth or TileLength tags have been set with TIFFSetField().

       %s: Must set "ImageWidth" before writing data:
          The imageâ€™s width has not be set before the first write.  See TIFFSetField() for information on how to do this.

       %s: Must set "PlanarConfiguration" before writing data:
          The organization of data has not be defined before the first write.  See TIFFSetField() for information on how to do this.

       %s: No space for tile arrays:
          There was not enough space for the arrays that hold tile offsets and byte counts.

       %s: Specified tile %d out of range, max %d:
          The specified tile is not valid according to the currently specified image dimensions.
