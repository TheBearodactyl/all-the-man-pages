NAME
       Test2::EventFacet::Assert - Facet representing an assertion.

DESCRIPTION
       The assertion facet is provided by any event representing an assertion that was made.

FIELDS
       $string = $assert->{details}
       $string = $assert->details()
           Human readable description of the assertion.

       $bool = $assert->{pass}
       $bool = $assert->pass()
           True if the assertion passed.

       $bool = $assert->{no_debug}
       $bool = $assert->no_debug()
           Set this to true if you have provided custom diagnostics and do not want the defaults to be displayed.

       $int = $assert->{number}
       $int = $assert->number()
           (Optional) assertion number. This may be omitted or ignored. This is usually only useful when parsing/processing TAP.

           Note: This is not set by the Test2 system, assertion number is not known until AFTER the assertion has been processed. This attribute is part of the spec only for harnesses.
