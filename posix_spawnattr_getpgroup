PROLOG
       This  manual  page is part of the POSIX Programmer's Manual.  The Linux
       implementation of this interface may differ (consult the  corresponding
       Linux  manual page for details of Linux behavior), or the interface may
       not be implemented on Linux.

NAME
       posix_spawnattr_getpgroup, posix_spawnattr_setpgroup — get and set  the
       spawn-pgroup attribute of a spawn attributes object (ADVANCED REALTIME)

SYNOPSIS
       #include <spawn.h>

       int posix_spawnattr_getpgroup(const posix_spawnattr_t *restrict attr,
           pid_t *restrict pgroup);
       int posix_spawnattr_setpgroup(posix_spawnattr_t *attr, pid_t pgroup);

DESCRIPTION
       The  posix_spawnattr_getpgroup() function shall obtain the value of the
       spawn-pgroup attribute from the attributes object referenced by attr.

       The posix_spawnattr_setpgroup() function shall set the spawn-pgroup at‐
       tribute in an initialized attributes object referenced by attr.

       The spawn-pgroup attribute represents the process group to be joined by
       the new process image in a spawn operation (if POSIX_SPAWN_SETPGROUP is
       set  in the spawn-flags attribute). The default value of this attribute
       shall be zero.

RETURN VALUE
       Upon successful completion,  posix_spawnattr_getpgroup()  shall  return
       zero and store the value of the spawn-pgroup attribute of attr into the
       object referenced by the pgroup parameter; otherwise, an  error  number
       shall be returned to indicate the error.

       Upon  successful  completion,  posix_spawnattr_setpgroup() shall return
       zero; otherwise, an error number shall be returned to indicate the  er‐
       ror.

ERRORS
       These functions may fail if:

       EINVAL The value specified by attr is invalid.

       The posix_spawnattr_setpgroup() function may fail if:

       EINVAL The value of the attribute being set is not valid.

       The following sections are informative.

EXAMPLES
       None.

APPLICATION USAGE
       These  functions  are part of the Spawn option and need not be provided
       on all implementations.

RATIONALE
       None.

FUTURE DIRECTIONS
       None.
