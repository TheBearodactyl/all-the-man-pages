NAME
       gnutls_certificate_set_x509_trust_file - API function

SYNOPSIS
       #include <gnutls/gnutls.h>

       int gnutls_certificate_set_x509_trust_file(gnutls_certificate_credentials_t            cred, const char * cafile, gnutls_x509_crt_fmt_t type);

ARGUMENTS
       gnutls_certificate_credentials_t            cred
                   is a gnutls_certificate_credentials_t type.

       const char * cafile
                   is a file containing the list of trusted CAs (DER or PEM list)

       gnutls_x509_crt_fmt_t type
                   is PEM or DER

DESCRIPTION
       This  function  adds the trusted CAs in order to verify client or server certificates. In case of a client this is not required to be called if the certificates are not verified using gnutls_cer‐
       tificate_verify_peers2().  This function may be called multiple times.

       In case of a server the names of the CAs set here will be sent to the client if a certificate request is sent. This can be disabled using gnutls_certificate_send_x509_rdn_sequence().

       This function can also accept URLs. In that case it will import all certificates that are marked as trusted. Note that the supported URLs are the ones indicated by gnutls_url_is_supported().

RETURNS
       the number of certificates processed
