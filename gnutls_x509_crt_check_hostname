NAME
       gnutls_x509_crt_check_hostname - API function

SYNOPSIS
       #include <gnutls/x509.h>

       unsigned gnutls_x509_crt_check_hostname(gnutls_x509_crt_t cert, const char * hostname);

ARGUMENTS
       gnutls_x509_crt_t cert
                   should contain an gnutls_x509_crt_t type

       const char * hostname
                   A null terminated string that contains a DNS name

DESCRIPTION
       This function will check if the given certificate's subject matches the given hostname.  This is a basic implementation of the matching described in RFC6125, and takes into account wildcards, and
       the DNSName/IPAddress subject alternative name PKIX extension.

       For details see also gnutls_x509_crt_check_hostname2().

RETURNS
       non-zero for a successful match, and zero on failure.
