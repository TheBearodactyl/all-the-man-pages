NAME
       audit_log_acct_message - log a user account message

SYNOPSIS
       #include <libaudit.h>

       int audit_log_acct_message(int audit_fd, int type, const char *pgname, const char *op, const char *name, unsigned int id, const char *host, const char *addr, const char *tty, int result)

DESCRIPTION
       This function will log a message to the audit system using a predefined message format. It should be used for all account manipulation operations. The function parameters are as follows:

              audit_fd - The fd returned by audit_open

              type - type of message: AUDIT_USER_CHAUTHTOK for changing any account attributes.

              pgname - program's name, if NULL will attempt to figure out

              op  -  operation. Ex: "adding-user", "changing-finger-info", "deleting-group". This value should have a dash or underscore between the words so that report parsers group them together.

              name - user's account or group name. If not available use NULL.

              id  -  uid or gid that the operation is being performed on. If the user is unknown, pass a -1 and fill in the name parameter. This is used only when user is NULL.

              host - The hostname if known. If not available pass a NULL.

              addr - The network address of the user. If not available pass a NULL.

              tty  - The tty of the user, if NULL will attempt to figure out

              result - 1 is "success" and 0 is "failed"

RETURN VALUE
       It returns the sequence number which is > 0 on success or <= 0 on error.

ERRORS
       This function returns -1 on failure. Examine errno for more info.
