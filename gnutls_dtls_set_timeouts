NAME
       gnutls_dtls_set_timeouts - API function

SYNOPSIS
       #include <gnutls/dtls.h>

       void gnutls_dtls_set_timeouts(gnutls_session_t session, unsigned int retrans_timeout, unsigned int total_timeout);

ARGUMENTS
       gnutls_session_t session
                   is a gnutls_session_t type.

       unsigned int retrans_timeout
                   The time at which a retransmission will occur in milliseconds

       unsigned int total_timeout
                   The time at which the connection will be aborted, in milliseconds.

DESCRIPTION
       This  function  will  set  the timeouts required for the DTLS handshake protocol. The retransmission timeout is the time after which a message from the peer is not received, the previous messages
       will be retransmitted. The total timeout is the time after which the handshake will be aborted with GNUTLS_E_TIMEDOUT.

       The DTLS protocol recommends the values of 1 sec and 60 seconds respectively, and these are the default values.

       To disable retransmissions set a  retrans_timeout larger than the  total_timeout .

SINCE
       3.0
