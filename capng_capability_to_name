NAME
       capng_capability_to_name - convert capability integer to text

SYNOPSIS
       #include <cap-ng.h>

       const char *capng_capability_to_name(unsigned int capability);

DESCRIPTION
       capng_capability_to_name  will  take  the  integer  being  passed and look it up to see what its text string representation would be. The integer being input must be in the valid range defined in
       linux/capabiliy.h. The string that is output is the same as the define text from linux/capabiliy.h with the CAP_ prefix removed and lower case. This is useful for  taking  integer  representation
       and converting it to something more user friendly for display.

RETURN VALUE
       This returns a NULL pointer on failure and the correct string otherwise.
