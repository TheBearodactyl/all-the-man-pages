NAME
       gnutls_x509_crt_get_crl_dist_points - API function

SYNOPSIS
       #include <gnutls/x509.h>

       int gnutls_x509_crt_get_crl_dist_points(gnutls_x509_crt_t cert, unsigned int seq, void * san, size_t * san_size, unsigned int * reason_flags, unsigned int * critical);

ARGUMENTS
       gnutls_x509_crt_t cert
                   should contain a gnutls_x509_crt_t type

       unsigned int seq
                   specifies the sequence number of the distribution point (0 for the first one, 1 for the second etc.)

       void * san  is the place where the distribution point will be copied to

       size_t * san_size
                   holds the size of ret.

       unsigned int * reason_flags
                   Revocation reasons. An ORed sequence of flags from gnutls_x509_crl_reason_flags_t.

       unsigned int * critical
                   will be non-zero if the extension is marked as critical (may be null)

DESCRIPTION
       This function retrieves the CRL distribution points (2.5.29.31), contained in the given certificate in the X509v3 Certificate Extensions.

RETURNS
       GNUTLS_E_SHORT_MEMORY_BUFFER and updates  ret_size if
        ret_size  is not enough to hold the distribution point, or the type of the distribution point if everything was ok. The type is one of the enumerated gnutls_x509_subject_alt_name_t.  If the cer‐
       tificate does not have an Alternative name with the specified sequence number then GNUTLS_E_REQUESTED_DATA_NOT_AVAILABLE is returned.
