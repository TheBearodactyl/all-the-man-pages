POSIX_TRACE_ATTR_DESTROY(3PPOSIX Programmer's ManuPOSIX_TRACE_ATTR_DESTROY(3P)

PROLOG
       This  manual  page is part of the POSIX Programmer's Manual.  The Linux
       implementation of this interface may differ (consult the  corresponding
       Linux  manual page for details of Linux behavior), or the interface may
       not be implemented on Linux.

NAME
       posix_trace_attr_destroy, posix_trace_attr_init — destroy and  initial‐
       ize the trace stream attributes object (TRACING)

SYNOPSIS
       #include <trace.h>

       int posix_trace_attr_destroy(trace_attr_t *attr);
       int posix_trace_attr_init(trace_attr_t *attr);

DESCRIPTION
       The  posix_trace_attr_destroy()  function  shall destroy an initialized
       trace attributes object.  A destroyed attr  attributes  object  can  be
       reinitialized  using  posix_trace_attr_init(); the results of otherwise
       referencing the object after it has been destroyed are undefined.

       The posix_trace_attr_init()  function  shall  initialize  a  trace  at‐
       tributes  object  attr with the default value for all of the individual
       attributes used by a given implementation.  The  read-only  generation-
       version  and clock-resolution attributes of the newly initialized trace
       attributes object shall be set to their appropriate values (see Section
       2.11.1.2, posix_trace_status_info Structure).

       Results  are  undefined if posix_trace_attr_init() is called specifying
       an already initialized attr attributes object.

       Implementations may add  extensions  to  the  trace  attributes  object
       structure  as permitted in the Base Definitions volume of POSIX.1‐2017,
       Chapter 2, Conformance.

       The resulting attributes object (possibly modified by setting  individ‐
       ual  attributes values), when used by posix_trace_create(), defines the
       attributes of the trace stream created. A single attributes object  can
       be  used  in multiple calls to posix_trace_create().  After one or more
       trace streams have been created using an attributes object,  any  func‐
       tion affecting that attributes object, including destruction, shall not
       affect any trace stream previously created. An  initialized  attributes
       object  also  serves  to  receive  the  attributes of an existing trace
       stream or trace log when calling the posix_trace_get_attr() function.

RETURN VALUE
       Upon successful completion, these functions shall  return  a  value  of
       zero. Otherwise, they shall return the corresponding error number.

ERRORS
       The posix_trace_attr_destroy() function may fail if:

       EINVAL The value of attr is invalid.

       The posix_trace_attr_init() function shall fail if:

       ENOMEM Insufficient  memory  exists  to initialize the trace attributes
              object.

RATIONALE

FUTURE DIRECTIONS
       The posix_trace_attr_destroy()  and  posix_trace_attr_init()  functions
       may be removed in a future version.
