NAME
       gnutls_x509_crl_get_crt_serial - API function

SYNOPSIS
       #include <gnutls/x509.h>

       int gnutls_x509_crl_get_crt_serial(gnutls_x509_crl_t crl, unsigned indx, unsigned char * serial, size_t * serial_size, time_t * t);

ARGUMENTS
       gnutls_x509_crl_t crl
                   should contain a gnutls_x509_crl_t type

       unsigned indx
                   the index of the certificate to extract (starting from 0)

       unsigned char * serial
                   where the serial number will be copied

       size_t * serial_size
                   initially holds the size of serial

       time_t * t  if non null, will hold the time this certificate was revoked

DESCRIPTION
       This function will retrieve the serial number of the specified, by the index, revoked certificate.

       Note that this function will have performance issues in large sequences of revoked certificates. In that case use gnutls_x509_crl_iter_crt_serial().

RETURNS
       On success, GNUTLS_E_SUCCESS (0) is returned, otherwise a negative error value.
