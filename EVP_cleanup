OPENSSL_ADD_ALL_ALGORITHMS(3ssl)                                                                  OpenSSL                                                                 OPENSSL_ADD_ALL_ALGORITHMS(3ssl)

NAME
       OpenSSL_add_all_algorithms, OpenSSL_add_all_ciphers, OpenSSL_add_all_digests, EVP_cleanup - add algorithms to internal table

SYNOPSIS
        #include <openssl/evp.h>

       The following functions have been deprecated since OpenSSL 1.1.0, and can be hidden entirely by defining OPENSSL_API_COMPAT with a suitable version value, see openssl_user_macros(7):

        void OpenSSL_add_all_algorithms(void);
        void OpenSSL_add_all_ciphers(void);
        void OpenSSL_add_all_digests(void);

        void EVP_cleanup(void);

DESCRIPTION
       OpenSSL keeps an internal table of digest algorithms and ciphers. It uses this table to lookup ciphers via functions such as EVP_get_cipher_byname().

       OpenSSL_add_all_digests() adds all digest algorithms to the table.

       OpenSSL_add_all_algorithms() adds all algorithms to the table (digests and ciphers).

       OpenSSL_add_all_ciphers() adds all encryption algorithms to the table including password based encryption algorithms.

       In versions prior to 1.1.0 EVP_cleanup() removed all ciphers and digests from the table. It no longer has any effect in OpenSSL 1.1.0.

RETURN VALUES
       None of the functions return a value.

SEE ALSO

HISTORY
       The OpenSSL_add_all_algorithms(), OpenSSL_add_all_ciphers(), OpenSSL_add_all_digests(), and EVP_cleanup(), functions were deprecated in OpenSSL 1.1.0 by OPENSSL_init_crypto() and should not be
       used.
