EVENT FIELDS
       response_type
                 The type of this event, in this case XCB_CONFIGURE_NOTIFY. This field is also present in the xcb_generic_event_t and can be used to tell events apart from each other.

       sequence  The sequence number of the last request processed by the X11 server.

       event     The reconfigured window or its parent, depending on whether StructureNotify or SubstructureNotify was selected.

       window    The window whose size, position, border, and/or stacking order was changed.

       above_sibling
                 If XCB_NONE, the window is on the bottom of the stack with respect to sibling windows. However, if set to a sibling window, the window is placed on top of this sibling window.

       x         The X coordinate of the upper-left outside corner of window, relative to the parent window's origin.

       y         The Y coordinate of the upper-left outside corner of window, relative to the parent window's origin.

       width     The inside width of window, not including the border.

       height    The inside height of window, not including the border.

       border_width
                 The border width of window.

       override_redirect
                 Window managers should ignore this window if override_redirect is 1.
