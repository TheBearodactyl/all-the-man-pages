TAP::Parser::Result::Unknown(3perl)                                                  Perl Programmers Reference Guide                                                  TAP::Parser::Result::Unknown(3perl)

NAME
       TAP::Parser::Result::Unknown - Unknown result token.

VERSION
       Version 3.44

DESCRIPTION
       This is a subclass of TAP::Parser::Result.  A token of this class will be returned if the parser does not recognize the token line.  For example:

        1..5
        VERSION 7
        ok 1 - woo hooo!
        ... woo hooo! is cool!

       In the above "TAP", the second and fourth lines will generate "Unknown" tokens.

OVERRIDDEN METHODS
