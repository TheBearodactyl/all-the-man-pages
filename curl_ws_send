NAME
       curl_ws_send - send WebSocket data

SYNOPSIS
       #include <curl/easy.h>

       CURLcode curl_ws_send(CURL *curl, const void *buffer, size_t buflen,
                             size_t *sent, curl_off_t fragsize,
                             unsigned int flags);

DESCRIPTION
       This function call is EXPERIMENTAL.

       Send the specific message fragment over an established WebSocket connection. The buffer holds the data to send and it is buflen number of payload bytes in that memory area.

       sent is returned as the number of payload bytes actually sent.

       To  send  a  (huge)  fragment using multiple calls with partial content per invoke, set the CURLWS_OFFSET bit and the fragsize argument as the total expected size for the first part, then set the
       CURLWS_OFFSET with a zero fragsize for the following parts.

       If not sending a partial fragment or if this is raw mode, fragsize should be set to zero.

       If CURLWS_RAW_MODE is enabled in CURLOPT_WS_OPTIONS(3), the flags argument should be set to 0.

       To send a message consisting of multiple frames, set the CURLWS_CONT bit in all frames except the final one.

FLAGS
       CURLWS_TEXT
              The buffer contains text data. Note that this makes a difference to WebSocket but libcurl itself will not make any verification of the content or precautions that you actually  send  valid
              UTF-8 content.

       CURLWS_BINARY
              This is binary data.

       CURLWS_CONT
              This is not the final fragment of the message, which implies that there will be another fragment coming as part of the same message where this bit is not set.

       CURLWS_CLOSE
              Close this transfer.

       CURLWS_PING
              This is a ping.

       CURLWS_PONG
              This is a pong.

       CURLWS_OFFSET
              The  provided  data  is only a partial fragment and there will be more in a following call to curl_ws_send(). When sending only a piece of the fragment like this, the fragsize must be pro‚Äê
              vided with the total expected fragment size in the first call and it needs to be zero in subsequent calls.
