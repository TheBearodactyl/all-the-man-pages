NAME
       MPI_Status_f2c, MPI_Status_c2f  - Translates a C status into a Fortran status, or vice versa.

SYNTAX
C Syntax
       #include <mpi.h>
       int MPI_Status_f2c(const MPI_Fint *f_status, MPI_Status *c_status)
       int MPI_Status_c2f(const MPI_Status *c_status, MPI_Fint *f_status)

DESCRIPTION
       These  two procedures are provided in C to convert from a Fortran status (which is an array of integers) to a C status (which is a structure), and vice versa. The conversion occurs on all the in‚Äê
       formation in status, including that which is hidden. That is, no status information is lost in the conversion.

       When using MPI_Status_f2c, if f_status is a valid Fortran status, but not the Fortran value of MPI_STATUS_IGNORE or MPI_STATUSES_IGNORE, then MPI_Status_f2c returns in c_status a valid  C  status
       with the same content. If f_status is the Fortran value of MPI_STATUS_IGNORE or MPI_STATUSES_IGNORE, or if f_status is not a valid Fortran status, then the call is erroneous.

       When using MPI_Status_c2f, the opposite conversion is applied. If c_status is MPI_STATUS_IGNORE or MPI_STATUSES_IGNORE, or if c_status is not a valid C status, then the call is erroneous.

       The  C status has the same source, tag and error code values as the Fortran status, and returns the same answers when queried for count, elements, and cancellation. The conversion function may be
       called with a Fortran status argument that has an undefined error field, in which case the value of the error field in the C status argument is undefined.
