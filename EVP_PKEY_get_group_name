NAME
       EVP_PKEY_get_group_name - get group name of a key

SYNOPSIS
        #include <openssl/evp.h>

        int EVP_PKEY_get_group_name(EVP_PKEY *pkey, char *gname, size_t gname_sz,
                                    size_t *gname_len);

DESCRIPTION
       EVP_PKEY_get_group_name() fills in the group name of the pkey into gname, up to at most gname_sz bytes including the ending NUL byte and assigns *gname_len the actual length of the name not
       including the NUL byte, if pkey's key type supports it.  gname as well as gname_len may individually be NULL, and won't be filled in or assigned in that case.

NOTES
       Among the standard OpenSSL key types, this is only supported for DH, EC and SM2 keys.  Other providers may support this for additional key types.

RETURN VALUES
       EVP_PKEY_get_group_name() returns 1 if the group name could be filled in, otherwise 0.
