NAME
       gnutls_x509_trust_list_get_issuer - API function

SYNOPSIS
       #include <gnutls/x509.h>

       int gnutls_x509_trust_list_get_issuer(gnutls_x509_trust_list_t list, gnutls_x509_crt_t cert, gnutls_x509_crt_t * issuer, unsigned int flags);

ARGUMENTS
       gnutls_x509_trust_list_t list
                   The list

       gnutls_x509_crt_t cert
                   is the certificate to find issuer for

       gnutls_x509_crt_t * issuer
                   Will hold the issuer if any. Should be treated as constant unless GNUTLS_TL_GET_COPY is set in  flags .

       unsigned int flags
                   flags from gnutls_trust_list_flags_t (GNUTLS_TL_GET_COPY is applicable)

DESCRIPTION
       This function will find the issuer of the given certificate.  If the flag GNUTLS_TL_GET_COPY is specified a copy of the issuer will be returned which must be freed using gnutls_x509_crt_deinit().
       In that case the provided  issuer must not be initialized.

       Note that the flag GNUTLS_TL_GET_COPY is required for this function to work with PKCS11 trust lists in a thread-safe way.

RETURNS
       On success, GNUTLS_E_SUCCESS (0) is returned, otherwise a negative error value.

SINCE
       3.0
