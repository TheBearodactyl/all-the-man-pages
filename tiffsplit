NAME
       tiffsplit - split a multi-image TIFF into single-image TIFF files

SYNOPSIS
       tiffsplit src.tif [ prefix ]

DESCRIPTION
       tiffsplit takes a multi-directory (page) TIFF file and creates one or more single-directory (page) TIFF files from it.  The output files are given names created by concatenating a prefix, a lexi‐
       cally ordered suffix in the range [aaa–zzz], the suffix .tif (e.g. xaaa.tif, xaab.tif, …, xzzz.tif).  If a prefix is not specified on the command line, the default prefix of x is used.

OPTIONS
       None.

EXIT STATUS
       tiffsplit exits with one of the following values:

       0:
          Success

       1:
          An error occurred either reading the input or writing results.

BUGS
       Only a select set of “known tags” are copied when splitting.
