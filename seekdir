seekdir(3)                 Library Functions Manual                 seekdir(3)

NAME
       seekdir  - set the position of the next readdir() call in the directory
       stream.

LIBRARY
       Standard C library (libc, -lc)

SYNOPSIS
       #include <dirent.h>

       void seekdir(DIR *dirp, long loc);

   Feature Test Macro Requirements for glibc (see feature_test_macros(7)):

       seekdir():
           _XOPEN_SOURCE
               || /* glibc >= 2.19: */ _DEFAULT_SOURCE
               || /* glibc <= 2.19: */ _BSD_SOURCE || _SVID_SOURCE

DESCRIPTION
       The seekdir() function sets the location in the directory  stream  from
       which  the next readdir(2) call will start.  The loc argument should be
       a value returned by a previous call to telldir(3).

RETURN VALUE
       The seekdir() function returns no value.

STANDARDS
       POSIX.1-2008.

HISTORY
       POSIX.1-2001, 4.3BSD.

CAVEATS
       Up   to   glibc  2.1.1,  the  type  of  the  loc  argument  was  off_t.
       POSIX.1-2001 specifies long, and this is  the  type  used  since  glibc
       2.1.2.   See telldir(3) for information on why you should be careful in
       making any assumptions about the value in this argument.

PROLOG
       This  manual  page is part of the POSIX Programmer's Manual.  The Linux
       implementation of this interface may differ (consult the  corresponding
       Linux  manual page for details of Linux behavior), or the interface may
       not be implemented on Linux.

NAME
       seekdir — set the position of a directory stream

SYNOPSIS
       #include <dirent.h>

       void seekdir(DIR *dirp, long loc);

DESCRIPTION
       The seekdir() function shall set the position of the next readdir() op‐
       eration on the directory stream specified by dirp to the position spec‐
       ified by loc.  The value of loc should have been returned from an  ear‐
       lier  call  to telldir() using the same directory stream. The new posi‐
       tion reverts to the one  associated  with  the  directory  stream  when
       telldir() was performed.

       If the value of loc was not obtained from an earlier call to telldir(),
       or if a call to rewinddir() occurred between the call to telldir()  and
       the call to seekdir(), the results of subsequent calls to readdir() are
       unspecified.

RETURN VALUE
       The seekdir() function shall not return a value.

ERRORS
       No errors are defined.

       The following sections are informative.

EXAMPLES
       None.

APPLICATION USAGE
       None.

RATIONALE
       The original standard developers perceived that there were restrictions
       on  the  use of the seekdir() and telldir() functions related to imple‐
       mentation details, and for that reason these functions need not be sup‐
       ported  on all POSIX-conforming systems. They are required on implemen‐
       tations supporting the XSI option.

       One of the perceived problems of implementation is that returning to  a
       given  point in a directory is quite difficult to describe formally, in
       spite of its intuitive appeal, when systems that use  B-trees,  hashing
       functions,  or  other similar mechanisms to order their directories are
       considered. The definition of seekdir() and telldir() does not  specify
       whether,  when  using these interfaces, a given directory entry will be
       seen at all, or more than once.

       On systems not supporting these functions, their capability  can  some‐
       times be accomplished by saving a filename found by readdir() and later
       using rewinddir() and a loop on readdir() to relocate the position from
       which the filename was saved.

FUTURE DIRECTIONS
       None.
