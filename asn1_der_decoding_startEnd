asn1_der_decoding_startEnd(3)                                                                    libtasn1                                                                    asn1_der_decoding_startEnd(3)

NAME
       asn1_der_decoding_startEnd - API function

SYNOPSIS
       #include <libtasn1.h>

       int asn1_der_decoding_startEnd(asn1_node element, const void * ider, int ider_len, const char * name_element, int * start, int * end);

ARGUMENTS
       asn1_node element
                   pointer to an ASN1 element

       const void * ider
                   vector that contains the DER encoding.

       int ider_len
                   number of bytes of * ider :  ider [0].. ider [len-1]

       const char * name_element
                   an element of NAME structure.

       int * start the position of the first byte of NAME_ELEMENT decoding ( ider [*start])

       int * end   the position of the last byte of NAME_ELEMENT decoding ( ider [*end])

DESCRIPTION
       Find  the start and end point of an element in a DER encoding string. I mean that if you have a der encoding and you have already used the function asn1_der_decoding() to fill a structure, it may
       happen that you want to find the piece of string concerning an element of the structure.

       One example is the sequence "tbsCertificate" inside an X509 certificate.

       Note that since libtasn1 3.7 the  ider and  ider_len parameters can be omitted, if the element is already decoded using asn1_der_decoding().

RETURNS
       ASN1_SUCCESS if DER encoding OK, ASN1_ELEMENT_NOT_FOUND if ELEMENT is asn1_node EMPTY or  name_element is not a valid element, ASN1_TAG_ERROR or ASN1_DER_ERROR if the der encoding  doesn't  match
       the structure ELEMENT.
