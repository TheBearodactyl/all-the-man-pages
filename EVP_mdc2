NAME
       EVP_mdc2 - MDC-2 For EVP

SYNOPSIS
        #include <openssl/evp.h>

        const EVP_MD *EVP_mdc2(void);

DESCRIPTION
       MDC-2 (Modification Detection Code 2 or Meyer-Schilling) is a cryptographic hash function based on a block cipher. This implementation is only available with the legacy provider.

       EVP_mdc2()
           The MDC-2DES algorithm of using MDC-2 with the DES block cipher. It produces a 128-bit output from a given input.

RETURN VALUES
       These functions return a EVP_MD structure that contains the implementation of the message digest. See EVP_MD_meth_new(3) for details of the EVP_MD structure.

CONFORMING TO
       ISO/IEC 10118-2:2000 Hash-Function 2, with DES as the underlying block cipher.
