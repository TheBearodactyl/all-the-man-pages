NAME
       XkbGetCompatMap - Fetch any combination of the current compatibility map components from the server

SYNOPSIS
       Status XkbGetCompatMap (Display *display, unsigned int which, XkbDescRec *xkb);

ARGUMENTS
       display
              connection to server

       which  mask of compatibility map components to fetch

       xkb    keyboard description where results placed

DESCRIPTION
       When  another client modifies the compatibility map, you are notified if you have selected for XkbCompatMapNotify events.  XkbGetCompatMap is particularly useful when you receive an event of this
       type, as it allows you to update your program's version of the compatibility map to match the modified version now in the server. If your program is dealing with multiple  servers  and  needs  to
       configure them all in a similar manner, the updated compatibility map may be used to reconfigure other servers.

       XkbGetCompatMap  fetches  the  components of the compatibility map specified in which from the server specified by display and places them in the compat structure of the keyboard description xkb.
       Valid values for which are an inclusive OR of the values shown in Table 1.

       ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
       Mask                 Value    Affecting
       ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
       XkbSymInterpMask     (1<<0)   Symbol interpretations
       XkbGroupCompatMask   (1<<1)   Group maps
       XkbAllCompatMask     (0x3)    All compatibility map components

       If no compatibility map structure is allocated in xkb upon entry, XkbGetCompatMap allocates one. If one already exists, its contents are overwritten with the returned results.

       XkbGetCompatMap fetches compatibility map information for the device specified by the device_spec field of xkb.  Unless you have specifically modified this field, it is the default  keyboard  de‐
       vice.   XkbGetCompatMap  returns Success if successful, BadAlloc if it is unable to obtain necessary storage for either the return values or work space, BadMatch if the dpy field of the xkb argu‐
       ment is non-NULL and does not match the display argument, and BadLength under certain conditions caused by server or Xkb implementation errors.

DIAGNOSTICS
       BadAlloc       Unable to allocate storage

       BadLength      The length of a request is shorter or longer than that required to minimally contain the arguments

       BadMatch       A compatible version of Xkb was not available in the server or an argument has correct type and range, but is otherwise invalid
