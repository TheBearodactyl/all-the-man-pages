PKCS12_PARSE(3ssl)                  OpenSSL                 PKCS12_PARSE(3ssl)

NAME
       PKCS12_parse - parse a PKCS#12 structure

SYNOPSIS
        #include <openssl/pkcs12.h>

        int PKCS12_parse(PKCS12 *p12, const char *pass, EVP_PKEY **pkey, X509 **cert,
                         STACK_OF(X509) **ca);

DESCRIPTION
       PKCS12_parse() parses a PKCS12 structure.

       p12 is the PKCS12 structure to parse. pass is the passphrase to use.
       If successful the private key will be written to *pkey, the
       corresponding certificate to *cert and any additional certificates to
       *ca.

NOTES
       Each of the parameters pkey, cert, and ca can be NULL in which case the
       private key, the corresponding certificate, or the additional
       certificates, respectively, will be discarded.  If any of pkey and cert
       is non-NULL the variable it points to is initialized.  If ca is non-
       NULL and *ca is NULL a new STACK will be allocated.  If ca is non-NULL
       and *ca is a valid STACK then additional certificates are appended in
       the given order to *ca.

       The friendlyName and localKeyID attributes (if present) on each
       certificate will be stored in the alias and keyid attributes of the
       X509 structure.

       The parameter pass is interpreted as a string in the UTF-8 encoding. If
       it is not valid UTF-8, then it is assumed to be ISO8859-1 instead.

       In particular, this means that passwords in the locale character set
       (or code page on Windows) must potentially be converted to UTF-8 before
       use. This may include passwords from local text files, or input from
       the terminal or command line. Refer to the documentation of
       UI_OpenSSL(3), for example.

RETURN VALUES
       PKCS12_parse() returns 1 for success and zero if an error occurred.

       The error can be obtained from ERR_get_error(3)

BUGS
       Only a single private key and corresponding certificate is returned by
       this function. More complex PKCS#12 files with multiple private keys
       will only return the first match.

       Only friendlyName and localKeyID attributes are currently stored in
       certificates. Other attributes are discarded.

       Attributes currently cannot be stored in the private key EVP_PKEY
       structure.
