NAME
       XtAppCreateShell, XtVaAppCreateShell - create top-level widget instance

SYNTAX
       #include <X11/Intrinsic.h>

       Widget XtAppCreateShell(const char *application_name, const char *application_class, WidgetClass widget_class, Display *display, ArgList args, Cardinal num_args);

       Widget XtVaAppCreateShell(const char * application_name, const char * application_class, WidgetClass widget_class, Display *display, ...);

ARGUMENTS
       application_name
                 Specifies the name of the application instance.

       application_class
                 Specifies the class name of this application, which usually is the generic name for all instances of this application.

       widget_class
                 Specifies the widget class that the application top-level widget should be.

       display   Specifies the display from which to get the resources.

       args      Specifies the argument list from which to get the resources.

       num_args  Specifies the number of arguments in the argument list.

       ...       Specifies the variable argument list from which to get the resources.

DESCRIPTION
       The XtAppCreateShell function saves the specified application name and application class for qualifying all widget resource specifiers.  The application name and application class are used as the
       left-most components in all widget resource names for this application.  XtAppCreateShell should be used to create a new logical application within a program or to create a shell on another dis‚Äê
       play.  In the first case, it allows the specification of a new root in the resource hierarchy.  In the second case, it uses the resource database associated with the other display.

       Note that the widget returned by XtAppCreateShell has the WM_COMMAND property set for session managers (see Chapter 4).
