NAME
       libssh2_channel_free - free all resources associated with a channel

SYNOPSIS
       #include <libssh2.h>

       int libssh2_channel_free(LIBSSH2_CHANNEL *channel);

DESCRIPTION
       channel - Channel stream to free.

       Release all resources associated with a channel stream. If the channel has not yet been closed with libssh2_channel_close(3) , it will be called automatically so that the remote end may know that
       it can safely free its own resources.

RETURN VALUE
       Return 0 on success or negative on failure.  It returns LIBSSH2_ERROR_EAGAIN when it would otherwise block. While LIBSSH2_ERROR_EAGAIN is a negative number, it isn't really a failure per se.
