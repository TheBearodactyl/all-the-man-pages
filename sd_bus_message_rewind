NAME
       sd_bus_message_rewind - Return to beginning of message or current
       container

SYNOPSIS
       #include <systemd/sd-bus.h>

       int sd_bus_message_rewind(sd_bus_message *m, int complete);

DESCRIPTION
       sd_bus_message_rewind() moves the "read pointer" in the message m to
       either the beginning of the message (if complete is true) or to the
       beginning of the currently open container. If no container is open,
       complete has no effect.

RETURN VALUE
       On success, this function returns 0 or a positive integer. The value is
       zero if the current container or whole message in case no container is
       open is empty, and positive otherwise. On failure, it returns a
       negative errno-style error code.

   Errors
       Returned errors may indicate the following problems:

       -EINVAL
           The m parameter is NULL.

       -EPERM
           The message m has not been sealed.

NOTES
       These APIs are implemented as a shared library, which can be compiled
       and linked to with the libsystemd pkg-config(1) file.
