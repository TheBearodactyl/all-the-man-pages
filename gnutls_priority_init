NAME
       gnutls_priority_init - API function

SYNOPSIS
       #include <gnutls/gnutls.h>

       int gnutls_priority_init(gnutls_priority_t * priority_cache, const char * priorities, const char ** err_pos);

ARGUMENTS
       gnutls_priority_t * priority_cache
                   is a gnutls_priority_t type.

       const char * priorities
                   is a string describing priorities (may be NULL)

       const char ** err_pos
                   In case of an error this will have the position in the string the error occurred

DESCRIPTION
       For  applications  that  do  not  modify their crypto settings per release, consider using gnutls_priority_init2() with GNUTLS_PRIORITY_INIT_DEF_APPEND flag instead. We suggest to use centralized
       crypto settings handled by the GnuTLS library, and applications modifying the default settings to their needs.

       This function is identical to gnutls_priority_init2() with zero flags.

       A NULL  priorities string indicates the default priorities to be used (this is available since GnuTLS 3.3.0).

RETURNS
       On syntax error GNUTLS_E_INVALID_REQUEST is returned, GNUTLS_E_SUCCESS on success, or an error code.
