NAME
       asn1_der_decoding - API function

SYNOPSIS
       #include <libtasn1.h>

       int asn1_der_decoding(asn1_node * element, const void * ider, int ider_len, char * errorDescription);

ARGUMENTS
       asn1_node * element
                   pointer to an ASN1 structure.

       const void * ider
                   vector that contains the DER encoding.

       int ider_len
                   number of bytes of * ider :  ider [0].. ider [len-1].

       char * errorDescription
                   null-terminated string contains details when an error occurred.

DESCRIPTION
       Fill the structure * element with values of a DER encoding string. The structure must just be created with function asn1_create_element().

       Note that the * element variable is provided as a pointer for historical reasons.

RETURNS
       ASN1_SUCCESS if DER encoding OK, ASN1_ELEMENT_NOT_FOUND if  ELEMENT is NULL, and ASN1_TAG_ERROR or ASN1_DER_ERROR if the der encoding doesn't match the structure name (* ELEMENT deleted).
