RPC_GSS_SET_CALLBACK(3)  BSD Library Functions Manual  RPC_GSS_SET_CALLBACK(3)

NAME
     rpc_gss_set_callback — Register a security context creation callback

SYNOPSIS
     #include <rpc/rpcsec_gss.h>

     bool_t
     (*callback)(struct svc_req *req, gss_cred_id_t deleg,
         gss_ctx_id_t gss_context, rpc_gss_lock_t *lock, void **cookie);

     bool_t
     rpc_gss_set_callback(rpc_gss_callback_t *cb);

DESCRIPTION
     Register a function which will be called when new security contexts are
     created on a server.  This function will be called on the first RPC re‐
     quest which uses that context and has the opportunity of rejecting the
     request (for instance after matching the request credentials to an access
     control list).  To accept the new security context, the callback should
     return TRUE, otherwise FALSE.  If the callback accepts a context, it be‐
     comes responsible for the lifetime of the delegated client credentials
     (if any).

     It is also possible to 'lock' the values of service and quality of pro‐
     tection used by the context.  If a context is locked, any subsequent re‐
     quests which use different values for service and quality of protection
     will be rejected.

PARAMETERS
     cb           A structure containing the RPC program and version for this
                  callback and a function which will be called when new con‐
                  texts are created for the given RPC program and version

     req          The RPC request using the new context

     deleg        GSS-API delegated credentials (if any)

     gss_context  The GSS-API context

     lock         A structure used to enforce a particular QOP and service.
                  Set lock->locked to TRUE to lock the service and QOP values

     cookie       The callback function may set *cookie to any pointer sized
                  value.  This value can be accessed during the lifetime of
                  the context via rpc_gss_getcred().

RETURN VALUES
     Returns TRUE if the callback was registered successfully or FALSE other‐
     wise

AVAILABILITY
     The rpc_gss_set_callback() function is part of libtirpc.

BUGS
     There is no mechanism for informing a server when a security context has
     been deleted.  This makes it difficult to allocate resources (e.g. to re‐
     turn via the callback's cookie argument).
