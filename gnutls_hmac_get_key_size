NAME
       gnutls_hmac_get_key_size - API function

SYNOPSIS
       #include <gnutls/crypto.h>

       unsigned gnutls_hmac_get_key_size(gnutls_mac_algorithm_t algorithm);

ARGUMENTS
       gnutls_mac_algorithm_t algorithm
                   the mac algorithm to use

DESCRIPTION
       This  function will return the size of the key to be used with this algorithm. On the algorithms which may accept arbitrary key sizes, the returned size is the MAC key size used in the TLS proto‐
       col.

RETURNS
       The key size or zero on error.

SINCE
       3.6.12
