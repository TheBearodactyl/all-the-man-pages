NAME
       gnutls_x509_crl_verify - API function

SYNOPSIS
       #include <gnutls/x509.h>

       int gnutls_x509_crl_verify(gnutls_x509_crl_t crl, const gnutls_x509_crt_t * trusted_cas, unsigned tcas_size, unsigned int flags, unsigned int * verify);

ARGUMENTS
       gnutls_x509_crl_t crl
                   is the crl to be verified

       const gnutls_x509_crt_t * trusted_cas
                   is a certificate list that is considered to be trusted one

       unsigned tcas_size
                   holds the number of CA certificates in CA_list

       unsigned int flags
                   Flags that may be used to change the verification algorithm. Use OR of the gnutls_certificate_verify_flags enumerations.

       unsigned int * verify
                   will hold the crl verification output.

DESCRIPTION
       This  function  will  try  to verify the given crl and return its verification status.  See gnutls_x509_crt_list_verify() for a detailed description of return values. Note that since GnuTLS 3.1.4
       this function includes the time checks.

       Note that value in  verify is set only when the return value of this function is success (i.e, failure to trust a CRL a certificate does not imply a negative return value).

       Before GnuTLS 3.5.7 this function would return zero or a positive number on success.

RETURNS
       On success, GNUTLS_E_SUCCESS (0), otherwise a negative error value.
