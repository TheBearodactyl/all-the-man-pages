NAME
       XkbGetAutoRepeatRate - Gets the current attributes of the RepeatKeys control for a keyboard device

SYNOPSIS
       Bool XkbGetAutoRepeatRate (Display *display, unsigned int device_spec, unsigned int *timeout_rtrn, unsigned int *interval_rtrn);

ARGUMENTS
       display
              connection to X server

       device_spec
              desired device ID, or XkbUseCoreKbd

       timeout_rtrn
              backfilled with initial repeat delay, ms

       interval_rtrn
              backfilled with subsequent repeat delay, ms

DESCRIPTION
       The core protocol allows only control over whether or not the entire keyboard or individual keys should auto-repeat when held down. RepeatKeys is a boolean control that extends this capability by
       adding control over the delay until a key begins to repeat and the rate at which it repeats. RepeatKeys is coupled with the core auto-repeat control: when RepeatKeys is enabled or  disabled,  the
       core auto-repeat is enabled or disabled and vice versa.

       Auto-repeating keys are controlled by two attributes. The first, timeout, is the delay after the initial press of an auto-repeating key and the first generated repeat event. The second, interval,
       is the delay between all subsequent generated repeat events. As with all boolean controls, configuring the attributes that determine how the control operates does  not  automatically  enable  the
       control as a whole.

       XkbGetAutoRepeatRate queries the server for the current values of the RepeatControls control attributes, backfills timeout_rtrn and interval_rtrn with them, and returns True. If a compatible ver‚Äê
       sion of the Xkb extension is not available in the server XkbGetAutoRepeatRate returns False.

RETURN VALUES
       True           The XkbGetAutoRepeatRate function returns True if a compatible version of the Xkb extension is available in the server.

       False          The XkbGetAutoRepeatRate function returns False if a compatible version of the Xkb extension is not available in the server.
