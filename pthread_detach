pthread_detach(3)          Library Functions Manual          pthread_detach(3)

NAME
       pthread_detach - detach a thread

LIBRARY
       POSIX threads library (libpthread, -lpthread)

SYNOPSIS
       #include <pthread.h>

       int pthread_detach(pthread_t thread);

DESCRIPTION
       The  pthread_detach() function marks the thread identified by thread as
       detached.  When a detached thread terminates, its resources  are  auto‐
       matically  released  back  to  the  system without the need for another
       thread to join with the terminated thread.

       Attempting to detach an already detached thread results in  unspecified
       behavior.

RETURN VALUE
       On  success,  pthread_detach() returns 0; on error, it returns an error
       number.

ERRORS
       EINVAL thread is not a joinable thread.

       ESRCH  No thread with the ID thread could be found.

STANDARDS
       POSIX.1-2008.

HISTORY
       POSIX.1-2001.

NOTES
       Once   a   thread   has   been   detached,  it  can't  be  joined  with
       pthread_join(3) or be made joinable again.

       A new thread can be created in a detached state using pthread_attr_set‐
       detachstate(3)  to  set  the detached attribute of the attr argument of
       pthread_create(3).

       The detached attribute merely determines the  behavior  of  the  system
       when  the  thread terminates; it does not prevent the thread from being
       terminated if the process terminates using exit(3) (or equivalently, if
       the main thread returns).

       Either  pthread_join(3)  or  pthread_detach() should be called for each
       thread that an application creates, so that system  resources  for  the
       thread  can  be  released.  (But note that the resources of any threads
       for which one of these actions has not been done will be freed when the
       process terminates.)

EXAMPLES
       The following statement detaches the calling thread:

           pthread_detach(pthread_self());

NAME
       pthread_detach — detach a thread

SYNOPSIS
       #include <pthread.h>

       int pthread_detach(pthread_t thread);

DESCRIPTION
       The pthread_detach() function shall indicate to the implementation that
       storage  for the thread thread can be reclaimed when that thread termi‐
       nates. If thread has not terminated, pthread_detach() shall  not  cause
       it to terminate.

       The behavior is undefined if the value specified by the thread argument
       to pthread_detach() does not refer to a joinable thread.

RETURN VALUE
       If the call succeeds, pthread_detach() shall return  0;  otherwise,  an
       error number shall be returned to indicate the error.

ERRORS
       The  pthread_detach()  function  shall  not  return  an  error  code of
       [EINTR].

       The following sections are informative.

EXAMPLES
       None.

APPLICATION USAGE
       None.

RATIONALE
       The pthread_join() or pthread_detach() functions should  eventually  be
       called for every thread that is created so that storage associated with
       the thread may be reclaimed.

       It has been suggested that a ``detach'' function is not necessary;  the
       detachstate  thread  creation  attribute  is sufficient, since a thread
       need never be dynamically detached. However, need arises  in  at  least
       two cases:

        1. In  a cancellation handler for a pthread_join() it is nearly essen‐
           tial to have a pthread_detach() function in  order  to  detach  the
           thread on which pthread_join() was waiting. Without it, it would be
           necessary to have the handler do another pthread_join() to  attempt
           to  detach the thread, which would both delay the cancellation pro‐
           cessing for an  unbounded  period  and  introduce  a  new  call  to
           pthread_join(),  which  might itself need a cancellation handler. A
           dynamic detach is nearly essential in this case.

        2. In order to detach the ``initial thread'' (as may be  desirable  in
           processes that set up server threads).

       If an implementation detects that the value specified by the thread ar‐
       gument to pthread_detach() does not refer to a joinable thread,  it  is
       recommended that the function should fail and report an [EINVAL] error.

       If  an  implementation  detects use of a thread ID after the end of its
       lifetime, it is recommended that the function should fail and report an
       [ESRCH] error.

FUTURE DIRECTIONS
       None.
