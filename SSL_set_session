SSL_SET_SESSION(3ssl)               OpenSSL              SSL_SET_SESSION(3ssl)

NAME
       SSL_set_session - set a TLS/SSL session to be used during TLS/SSL
       connect

SYNOPSIS
        #include <openssl/ssl.h>

        int SSL_set_session(SSL *ssl, SSL_SESSION *session);

DESCRIPTION
       SSL_set_session() sets session to be used when the TLS/SSL connection
       is to be established. SSL_set_session() is only useful for TLS/SSL
       clients.  When the session is set, the reference count of session is
       incremented by 1. If the session is not reused, the reference count is
       decremented again during SSL_connect(). Whether the session was reused
       can be queried with the SSL_session_reused(3) call.

       If there is already a session set inside ssl (because it was set with
       SSL_set_session() before or because the same ssl was already used for a
       connection), SSL_SESSION_free() will be called for that session.  This
       is also the case when session is a NULL pointer. If that old session is
       still open, it is considered bad and will be removed from the session
       cache (if used). A session is considered open, if SSL_shutdown(3) was
       not called for the connection (or at least SSL_set_shutdown(3) was used
       to set the SSL_SENT_SHUTDOWN state).

NOTES
       SSL_SESSION objects keep internal link information about the session
       cache list, when being inserted into one SSL_CTX object's session
       cache.  One SSL_SESSION object, regardless of its reference count, must
       therefore only be used with one SSL_CTX object (and the SSL objects
       created from this SSL_CTX object).

RETURN VALUES
       The following return values can occur:

       0   The operation failed; check the error stack to find out the reason.

       1   The operation succeeded.
