NAME
       mmroff - cross-reference preprocessor for GNU roff mm macro package

SYNOPSIS
       mmroff [-x] groff-arguments

DESCRIPTION
       mmroff is a simple preprocessor for groff, used for expanding cross references in mm; see groff_mm(7).  groff is executed twice, first with -z and -rRef=1 to collect all cross references and then
       to do the real processing when the cross-reference file is up to date.

OPTIONS
       -x     Just create the cross-reference file.  This can be used to refresh the cross-reference file; it isn't always needed to have accurate cross references and by using this  option  groff  will
              only be run once.

AUTHORS
       mmroff was written by Jörgen Hägg ⟨jh@axis.se⟩ of Lund, Sweden.
