Unicode::Collate::CJK::GB2312(3perl)                                                 Perl Programmers Reference Guide                                                 Unicode::Collate::CJK::GB2312(3perl)

NAME
       Unicode::Collate::CJK::GB2312 - weighting CJK Unified Ideographs for Unicode::Collate

SYNOPSIS
           use Unicode::Collate;
           use Unicode::Collate::CJK::GB2312;

           my $collator = Unicode::Collate->new(
               overrideCJK => \&Unicode::Collate::CJK::GB2312::weightGB2312
           );

DESCRIPTION
       "Unicode::Collate::CJK::GB2312" provides "weightGB2312()", that is adequate for "overrideCJK" of "Unicode::Collate" and makes tailoring of CJK Unified Ideographs in the order of CLDR's gb2312han
       ordering.

CAVEAT
       The gb2312han ordering includes 5 code points in private use area (E2D8..E2DC), that can't utilize "weightGB2312()" for collation.  For them, use "entry" instead.
