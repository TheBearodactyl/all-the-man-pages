DESCRIPTION
       TIFFDefaultTileSize()  returns  the  pixel width and height of a reasonable-sized tile; suitable for setting up the TileWidth and TileLength tags.  If the tw and th values passed in are non-zero,
       then they are adjusted to reflect any compression-specific requirements. The returned width and height are constrained to be a multiple of 16 pixels to conform with the TIFF specification.

       TIFFTileSize() returns the equivalent size for a tile of data as it would be returned in a call to TIFFReadTile() or as it would be expected in a call to  TIFFWriteTile().   TIFFTileSize64()  re‐
       turns a uint64_t number.  If an error occurs, 0 is returned.

       TIFFVTileSize() returns the number of bytes in a row-aligned tile with nrows of data.  TIFFVTileSize64() returns a uint64_t number.  If an error occurs, 0 is returned.

       TIFFTileRowSize() returns the number of bytes of a row of data in a tile.  TIFFTileRowSize64() returns a uint64_t number.  If an error occurs, 0 is returned.

       TIFFComputeTile() returns the tile that contains the specified coordinates. A valid tile is always returned; out-of-range coordinate values are clamped to the bounds of the image. The x and y pa‐
       rameters are always used in calculating a tile. The z parameter is used if the image is deeper than 1 slice (ImageDepth > 1).  The sample parameter is used only if data are organized in  separate
       planes (PlanarConfiguration = 2).

       TIFFCheckTile()  returns  a  non-zero  value if the supplied coordinates are within the bounds of the image and zero otherwise. The x parameter is checked against the value of the ImageWidth tag.
       The y parameter is checked against the value of the ImageLength tag. The z parameter is checked against the value of the ImageDepth tag (if defined). The sample parameter is checked  against  the
       value of the SamplesPerPixel parameter if the data are organized in separate planes.

       TIFFNumberOfTiles() returns the number of tiles in the image.

DIAGNOSTICS
       None.
