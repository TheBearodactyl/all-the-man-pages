NAME
       gnutls_ocsp_resp_get_certs - API function

SYNOPSIS
       #include <gnutls/ocsp.h>

       int gnutls_ocsp_resp_get_certs(gnutls_ocsp_resp_const_t resp, gnutls_x509_crt_t ** certs, size_t * ncerts);

ARGUMENTS
       gnutls_ocsp_resp_const_t resp
                   should contain a gnutls_ocsp_resp_t type

       gnutls_x509_crt_t ** certs
                   newly allocated array with gnutls_x509_crt_t certificates

       size_t * ncerts
                   output variable with number of allocated certs.

DESCRIPTION
       This function will extract the X.509 certificates found in the Basic OCSP Response.  The  certs output variable will hold a newly allocated zero-terminated array with X.509 certificates.

       Every certificate in the array needs to be de-allocated with gnutls_x509_crt_deinit() and the array itself must be freed using gnutls_free().

       Both  the  certs and  ncerts variables may be NULL.  Then the function will work as normal but will not return the NULL:d information.  This can be used to get the number of certificates only, or
       to just get the certificate array without its size.

RETURNS
       On success, GNUTLS_E_SUCCESS (0) is returned, otherwise a negative error value.
