NAME
       grantpt - grant access to the slave pseudoterminal

LIBRARY
       Standard C library (libc, -lc)

SYNOPSIS
       #include <stdlib.h>

       int grantpt(int fd);

   Feature Test Macro Requirements for glibc (see feature_test_macros(7)):

       grantpt():
           Since glibc 2.24:
               _XOPEN_SOURCE >= 500
           glibc 2.23 and earlier:
               _XOPEN_SOURCE

DESCRIPTION
       The grantpt() function changes the mode and owner of the slave pseudoterminal device corresponding to the master pseudoterminal referred to by the file descriptor fd.  The user ID of the slave is
       set to the real UID of the calling process.  The group ID is set to an unspecified value (e.g., tty).  The mode of the slave is set to 0620 (crw--w----).

       The behavior of grantpt() is unspecified if a signal handler is installed to catch SIGCHLD signals.

RETURN VALUE
       When successful, grantpt() returns 0.  Otherwise, it returns -1 and sets errno to indicate the error.

ERRORS
       EACCES The corresponding slave pseudoterminal could not be accessed.

       EBADF  The fd argument is not a valid open file descriptor.

       EINVAL The fd argument is valid but not associated with a master pseudoterminal.

VERSIONS
       Many systems implement this function via a set-user-ID helper binary called "pt_chown".  On Linux systems with a devpts filesystem (present since Linux 2.2), the kernel normally sets the  correct
       ownership and permissions for the pseudoterminal slave when the master is opened (posix_openpt(3)), so that nothing must be done by grantpt().  Thus, no such helper binary is required (and indeed
       it is configured to be absent during the glibc build that is typical on many systems).

NAME
       grantpt — grant access to the slave pseudo-terminal device

SYNOPSIS
       #include <stdlib.h>

       int grantpt(int fildes);

DESCRIPTION
       The grantpt() function shall change the mode and ownership of the slave pseudo-terminal device associated with its master pseudo-terminal counterpart. The fildes argument  is  a  file  descriptor
       that  refers to a master pseudo-terminal device. The user ID of the slave shall be set to the real UID of the calling process and the group ID shall be set to an unspecified group ID. The permis‐
       sion mode of the slave pseudo-terminal shall be set to readable and writable by the owner, and writable by the group.

       The behavior of the grantpt() function is unspecified if the application has installed a signal handler to catch SIGCHLD signals.

RETURN VALUE
       Upon successful completion, grantpt() shall return 0; otherwise, it shall return -1 and set errno to indicate the error.

ERRORS
       The grantpt() function may fail if:

       EACCES The corresponding slave pseudo-terminal device could not be accessed.

       EBADF  The fildes argument is not a valid open file descriptor.

       EINVAL The fildes argument is not associated with a master pseudo-terminal device.
