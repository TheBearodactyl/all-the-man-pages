PTHREAD_RWLOCKATTR_DESTROY(POSIX Programmer's MaPTHREAD_RWLOCKATTR_DESTROY(3P)

PROLOG
       This  manual  page is part of the POSIX Programmer's Manual.  The Linux
       implementation of this interface may differ (consult the  corresponding
       Linux  manual page for details of Linux behavior), or the interface may
       not be implemented on Linux.

NAME
       pthread_rwlockattr_destroy, pthread_rwlockattr_init — destroy and  ini‐
       tialize the read-write lock attributes object

SYNOPSIS
       #include <pthread.h>

       int pthread_rwlockattr_destroy(pthread_rwlockattr_t *attr);
       int pthread_rwlockattr_init(pthread_rwlockattr_t *attr);

DESCRIPTION
       The  pthread_rwlockattr_destroy()  function  shall destroy a read-write
       lock attributes object. A  destroyed  attr  attributes  object  can  be
       reinitialized using pthread_rwlockattr_init(); the results of otherwise
       referencing the object after it has been destroyed  are  undefined.  An
       implementation may cause pthread_rwlockattr_destroy() to set the object
       referenced by attr to an invalid value.

       The pthread_rwlockattr_init() function shall  initialize  a  read-write
       lock  attributes  object attr with the default value for all of the at‐
       tributes defined by the implementation.

       Results are undefined if pthread_rwlockattr_init() is called specifying
       an already initialized attr attributes object.

       After  a  read-write lock attributes object has been used to initialize
       one or more read-write locks, any function affecting the attributes ob‐
       ject  (including  destruction) shall not affect any previously initial‐
       ized read-write locks.

       The behavior is undefined if the value specified by the  attr  argument
       to  pthread_rwlockattr_destroy() does not refer to an initialized read-
       write lock attributes object.

RETURN VALUE
       If successful,  the  pthread_rwlockattr_destroy()  and  pthread_rwlock‐
       attr_init()  functions  shall  return  zero; otherwise, an error number
       shall be returned to indicate the error.

ERRORS
       The pthread_rwlockattr_init() function shall fail if:

       ENOMEM Insufficient memory exists to initialize the read-write lock at‐
              tributes object.

       These functions shall not return an error code of [EINTR].

       The following sections are informative.

EXAMPLES
       None.

APPLICATION USAGE
       None.

RATIONALE
       If an implementation detects that the value specified by the attr argu‐
       ment to pthread_rwlockattr_destroy() does not refer to  an  initialized
       read-write  lock attributes object, it is recommended that the function
       should fail and report an [EINVAL] error.

FUTURE DIRECTIONS
       None.
