   Reply function
       xcb_query_text_extents_reply_t *xcb_query_text_extents_reply(xcb_connection_t *conn, xcb_query_text_extents_cookie_t cookie, xcb_generic_error_t **e);

REQUEST ARGUMENTS
       conn      The XCB connection to X11.

       font      The font to calculate text extents in. You can also pass a graphics context.

       string_len
                 The number of characters in string.

       string    The text to get text extents for.

REPLY FIELDS
       response_type
                 The type of this reply, in this case XCB_QUERY_TEXT_EXTENTS. This field is also present in the xcb_generic_reply_t and can be used to tell replies apart from each other.

       sequence  The sequence number of the last request processed by the X11 server.

       length    The length of the reply, in words (a word is 4 bytes).

       draw_direction
                 One of the following values:

                 XCB_FONT_DRAW_LEFT_TO_RIGHT
                           TODO: NOT YET DOCUMENTED.

                 XCB_FONT_DRAW_RIGHT_TO_LEFT
                           TODO: NOT YET DOCUMENTED.
                 TODO: NOT YET DOCUMENTED.

       font_ascent
                 TODO: NOT YET DOCUMENTED.

       font_descent
                 TODO: NOT YET DOCUMENTED.

       overall_ascent
                 TODO: NOT YET DOCUMENTED.

       overall_descent
                 TODO: NOT YET DOCUMENTED.

       overall_width
                 TODO: NOT YET DOCUMENTED.

       overall_left
                 TODO: NOT YET DOCUMENTED.

       overall_right
                 TODO: NOT YET DOCUMENTED.

DESCRIPTION
       Query text extents from the X11 server. This request returns the bounding box of the specified 16-bit character string in the specified font or the font contained in the specified graphics con‐
       text.

       font_ascent is set to the maximum of the ascent metrics of all characters in the string. font_descent is set to the maximum of the descent metrics.  overall_width is set to the sum of the charac‐
       ter-width metrics of all characters in the string. For each character in the string, let W be the sum of the character-width metrics of all characters preceding it in the string. Let L be the
       left-side-bearing metric of the character plus W. Let R be the right-side-bearing metric of the character plus W. The lbearing member is set to the minimum L of all characters in the string. The
       rbearing member is set to the maximum R.

       For fonts defined with linear indexing rather than 2-byte matrix indexing, each xcb_char2b_t structure is interpreted as a 16-bit number with byte1 as the most significant byte. If the font has
       no defined default character, undefined characters in the string are taken to have all zero metrics.

       Characters with all zero metrics are ignored. If the font has no defined default_char, the undefined characters in the string are also ignored.

RETURN VALUE
       Returns an xcb_query_text_extents_cookie_t. Errors have to be handled when calling the reply function xcb_query_text_extents_reply.

       If you want to handle errors in the event loop instead, use xcb_query_text_extents_unchecked. See xcb-requests(3) for details.

ERRORS
       xcb_font_error_t
                 The specified font does not exist.

       xcb_g_context_error_t
                 The specified graphics context does not exist.
