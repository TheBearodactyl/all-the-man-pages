NAME
     acl_copy_int — copy an ACL from external to internal representation

LIBRARY
     Linux Access Control Lists library (libacl, -lacl).

SYNOPSIS
     #include <sys/types.h>
     #include <sys/acl.h>

     acl_t
     acl_copy_int(const void *buf_p);

DESCRIPTION
     The acl_copy_int() function copies an exportable, contiguous, persistent form of an ACL, pointed to by buf_p, to the internal representation.

     This function may cause memory to be allocated.  The caller should free any releasable memory, when the new ACL is no longer required, by calling acl_free(3) with the (void*)acl_t returned by
     acl_copy_int() as an argument.

RETURN VALUE
     Upon success, the acl_copy_int() function returns a pointer that references the ACL in working storage.  On error, a value of (acl_t)NULL is returned, and errno is set appropriately.

ERRORS
     If any of the following conditions occur, the acl_copy_int() function returns a value of (acl_t)NULL and sets errno to the corresponding value:

     [EINVAL]           The buffer pointed to by the argument buf_p does not contain a valid external form ACL.

     [ENOMEM]           The ACL working storage requires more memory than is allowed by the hardware or system-imposed memory management constraints.

STANDARDS
     IEEE Std 1003.1e draft 17 (“POSIX.1e”, abandoned)
