NAME
       eof - Check for end of file condition on channel

SYNOPSIS
       eof channelId
__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

DESCRIPTION
       Returns 1 if an end of file condition occurred during the most recent input operation on channelId (such as gets), 0 otherwise.

       ChannelId  must  be  an identifier for an open channel such as a Tcl standard channel (stdin, stdout, or stderr), the return value from an invocation of open or socket, or the result of a channel
       creation command provided by a Tcl extension.

EXAMPLES
       Read and print out the contents of a file line-by-line:

              set f [open somefile.txt]
              while {1} {
                  set line [gets $f]
                  if {[eof $f]} {
                      close $f
                      break
                  }
                  puts "Read line: $line"
              }

       Read and print out the contents of a file by fixed-size records:

              set f [open somefile.dat]
              fconfigure $f -translation binary
              set recordSize 40
              while {1} {
                  set record [read $f $recordSize]
                  if {[eof $f]} {
                      close $f
                      break
                  }
                  puts "Read record: $record"
              }

NAME
       EOF - end of file or error indicator

LIBRARY
       Standard C library (libc)

SYNOPSIS
       #include <stdio.h>

       #define EOF  /* ... */

DESCRIPTION
       EOF represents the end of an input file, or an error indication.  It is a negative value, of type int.

       EOF is not a character (it can't be represented by unsigned char).  It is instead a sentinel value outside of the valid range for valid characters.

CONFORMING TO
       C99 and later; POSIX.1-2001 and later.

CAVEATS
       Programs  can't  pass  this value to an output function to "write" the end of a file.  That would likely result in undefined behavior.  Instead, closing the writing stream or file descriptor that
       refers to such file is the way to signal the end of that file.
