NAME
       gnutls_priority_string_list - API function

SYNOPSIS
       #include <gnutls/gnutls.h>

       const char * gnutls_priority_string_list(unsigned iter, unsigned int flags);

ARGUMENTS
       unsigned iter
                   an integer counter starting from zero

       unsigned int flags
                   one of GNUTLS_PRIORITY_LIST_INIT_KEYWORDS, GNUTLS_PRIORITY_LIST_SPECIAL

DESCRIPTION
       Can be used to iterate all available priority strings.  Due to internal implementation details, there are cases where this function can return the empty string. In that case that string should be
       ignored.  When no strings are available it returns NULL.
