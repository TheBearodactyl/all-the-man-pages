NAME
       TAP::Parser::Iterator::Array - Iterator for array-based TAP sources

VERSION
       Version 3.44

SYNOPSIS
         use TAP::Parser::Iterator::Array;
         my @data = ('foo', 'bar', baz');
         my $it   = TAP::Parser::Iterator::Array->new(\@data);
         my $line = $it->next;

DESCRIPTION
       This is a simple iterator wrapper for arrays of scalar content, used by TAP::Parser.  Unless you're writing a plugin or subclassing, you probably won't need to use this module directly.

METHODS
   Class Methods
       "new"

       Create an iterator.  Takes one argument: an $array_ref

   Instance Methods
       "next"

       Iterate through it, of course.

       "next_raw"

       Iterate raw input without applying any fixes for quirky input syntax.

       "wait"

       Get the wait status for this iterator. For an array iterator this will always be zero.

       "exit"

       Get the exit status for this iterator. For an array iterator this will always be zero.
