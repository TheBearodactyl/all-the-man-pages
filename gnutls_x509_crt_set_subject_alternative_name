NAME
       gnutls_x509_crt_set_subject_alternative_name - API function

SYNOPSIS
       #include <gnutls/x509.h>

       int gnutls_x509_crt_set_subject_alternative_name(gnutls_x509_crt_t crt, gnutls_x509_subject_alt_name_t           type, const char * data_string);

ARGUMENTS
       gnutls_x509_crt_t crt
                   a certificate of type gnutls_x509_crt_t

       gnutls_x509_subject_alt_name_t           type
                   is one of the gnutls_x509_subject_alt_name_t enumerations

       const char * data_string
                   The data to be set, a (0) terminated string

DESCRIPTION
       This function will set the subject alternative name certificate extension. This function assumes that data can be expressed as a null terminated string.

       The name of the function is unfortunate since it is inconsistent with gnutls_x509_crt_get_subject_alt_name().

       See gnutls_x509_crt_set_subject_alt_name() for more information.

RETURNS
       On success, GNUTLS_E_SUCCESS (0) is returned, otherwise a negative error value.
