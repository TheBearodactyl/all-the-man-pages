NAME
       gnutls_session_enable_compatibility_mode - API function

SYNOPSIS
       #include <gnutls/gnutls.h>

       void gnutls_session_enable_compatibility_mode(gnutls_session_t session);

ARGUMENTS
       gnutls_session_t session
                   is a gnutls_session_t type.

DESCRIPTION
       This function can be used to disable certain (security) features in TLS in order to maintain maximum compatibility with buggy clients. Because several trade-offs with security are enabled, if re‐
       quired they will be reported through the audit subsystem.

       Normally only servers that require maximum compatibility with everything out there, need to call this function.

       Note that this function must be called after any call to gnutls_priority functions.

SINCE
       2.1.4
