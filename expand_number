NAME
     expand_number â€” format a number from human readable form

LIBRARY
     Utility functions from BSD systems (libbsd, -lbsd)

SYNOPSIS
     #include <libutil.h>
     (See libbsd(7) for include usage.)

     int
     expand_number(const char *buf, uint64_t *num);

DESCRIPTION
     The expand_number() function unformats the buf string and stores a unsigned 64-bit quantity at address pointed out by the num argument.

     The expand_number() function follows the SI power of two convention.

     The prefixes are:

           Prefix    Description    Multiplier
           k         kilo           1024
           M         mega           1048576
           G         giga           1073741824
           T         tera           1099511627776
           P         peta           1125899906842624
           E         exa            1152921504606846976

RETURN VALUES
     Upon successful completion, the value 0 is returned; otherwise the value -1 is returned and the global variable errno is set to indicate the error.

ERRORS
     The expand_number() function will fail if:

     [EINVAL]           The given string contains no digits.

     [EINVAL]           An unrecognized prefix was given.

     [ERANGE]           Result doesn't fit into 64 bits.
