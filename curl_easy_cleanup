NAME
       curl_easy_cleanup - End a libcurl easy handle

SYNOPSIS
       #include <curl/curl.h>

       void curl_easy_cleanup(CURL *handle);

DESCRIPTION
       This function must be the last function to call for an easy session. It is the opposite of the curl_easy_init(3) function and must be called with the same handle as input that a curl_easy_init(3)
       call returned.

       This might close all connections this handle has used and possibly has kept open until now - unless it was attached to a multi handle while doing the transfers. Do not call this function  if  you
       intend to transfer more files, re-using handles is a key to good performance with libcurl.

       Occasionally you may get your progress callback or header callback called from within curl_easy_cleanup(3) (if previously set for the handle using curl_easy_setopt(3)). Like if libcurl decides to
       shut down the connection and the protocol is of a kind that requires a command/response sequence before disconnect. Examples of such protocols are FTP, POP3 and IMAP.

       Any use of the handle after this function has been called and have returned, is illegal. curl_easy_cleanup(3) kills the handle and all memory associated with it!

       To close an easy handle that has been used with the multi interface, make sure to call curl_multi_remove_handle(3) first to remove it from the multi handle before it is closed.

       Passing in a NULL pointer in handle will make this function return immediately with no action.

EXAMPLE
       CURL *curl = curl_easy_init();
       if(curl) {
         CURLcode res;
         curl_easy_setopt(curl, CURLOPT_URL, "https://example.com");
         res = curl_easy_perform(curl);
         curl_easy_cleanup(curl);
       }
