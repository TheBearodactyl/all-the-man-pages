SSL_GET_PSK_IDENTITY(3ssl)          OpenSSL         SSL_GET_PSK_IDENTITY(3ssl)

NAME
       SSL_get_psk_identity, SSL_get_psk_identity_hint - get PSK client
       identity and hint

SYNOPSIS
        #include <openssl/ssl.h>

        const char *SSL_get_psk_identity_hint(const SSL *ssl);
        const char *SSL_get_psk_identity(const SSL *ssl);

DESCRIPTION
       SSL_get_psk_identity_hint() is used to retrieve the PSK identity hint
       used during the connection setup related to SSL object ssl. Similarly,
       SSL_get_psk_identity() is used to retrieve the PSK identity used during
       the connection setup.

RETURN VALUES
       If non-NULL, SSL_get_psk_identity_hint() returns the PSK identity hint
       and SSL_get_psk_identity() returns the PSK identity. Both are
       NULL-terminated. SSL_get_psk_identity_hint() may return NULL if no PSK
       identity hint was used during the connection setup.

       Note that the return value is valid only during the lifetime of the SSL
       object ssl.
