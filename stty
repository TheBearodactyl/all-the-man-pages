PROLOG
       This  manual  page is part of the POSIX Programmer's Manual.  The Linux
       implementation of this interface may differ (consult the  corresponding
       Linux  manual page for details of Linux behavior), or the interface may

NAME
       stty â set the options for a terminal

SYNOPSIS
       stty [-a|-g]

       stty operand...

DESCRIPTION
       The stty utility shall set or report on  terminal  I/O  characteristics
       for  the device that is its standard input. Without options or operands
       specified, it shall report the  settings  of  certain  characteristics,
       usually those that differ from implementation-defined defaults.  Otherâ
       wise, it shall modify the terminal state according to the specified opâ
       erands.  Detailed  information about the modes listed in the first five
       groups  below  are  described  in  the  Base  Definitions   volume   of
       POSIX.1â2017,  Chapter 11, General Terminal Interface.  Operands in the
       Combination Modes group (see Combination Modes) are  implemented  using
       operands  in the previous groups. Some combinations of operands are muâ
       tually-exclusive on some terminal types; the results of using such comâ
       binations are unspecified.

       Typical  implementations  of this utility require a communications line
       configured to use the termios interface defined in  the  System  Interâ
       faces  volume of POSIX.1â2017. On systems where none of these lines are
       available, and on lines not currently configured to support the termios
       interface,  some  of the operands need not affect terminal characterisâ
       tics.

OPTIONS
       The stty utility shall  conform  to  the  Base  Definitions  volume  of
       POSIX.1â2017, Section 12.2, Utility Syntax Guidelines.

       The following options shall be supported:

       -a        Write  to  standard  output  all the current settings for the
                 terminal.

       -g        Write to standard output all the current settings in  an  unâ
                 specified form that can be used as arguments to another invoâ
                 cation of the stty utility on the same system. The form  used
                 shall  not  contain any characters that would require quoting
                 to avoid word expansion by the shell; see Section  2.6,  Word
                 Expansions.

OPERANDS
       The  following  operands shall be supported to set the terminal characâ
       teristics.

   Control Modes
       parenb (-parenb)
                   Enable (disable)  parity  generation  and  detection.  This
                   shall  have  the  effect of setting (not setting) PARENB in
                   the termios c_cflag field, as defined in the  Base  Definiâ
                   tions  volume of POSIX.1â2017, Chapter 11, General Terminal
                   Interface.

       parodd (-parodd)
                   Select odd (even) parity. This shall  have  the  effect  of
                   setting  (not setting) PARODD in the termios c_cflag field,
                   as defined in the Base Definitions volume of  POSIX.1â2017,
                   Chapter 11, General Terminal Interface.

       cs5 cs6 cs7 cs8
                   Select character size, if possible. This shall have the efâ
                   fect of setting CS5, CS6, CS7, and  CS8,  respectively,  in
                   the  termios  c_cflag field, as defined in the Base Definiâ
                   tions volume of POSIX.1â2017, Chapter 11, General  Terminal
                   Interface.

       number      Set terminal baud rate to the number given, if possible. If
                   the baud rate is set to zero, the modem control lines shall
                   no  longer  be asserted. This shall have the effect of setâ
                   ting the input and output termios baud rate values  as  deâ
                   fined in the Base Definitions volume of POSIX.1â2017, Chapâ
                   ter 11, General Terminal Interface.

       ispeed number
                   Set terminal input baud rate to the number given, if possiâ
                   ble.  If the input baud rate is set to zero, the input baud
                   rate shall be specified by the value  of  the  output  baud
                   rate.  This  shall  have  the  effect  of setting the input
                   termios baud rate values as defined in the Base Definitions
                   volume of POSIX.1â2017, Chapter 11, General Terminal Interâ

                   Set terminal output baud rate to the number given, if  posâ
                   sible.  If  the  output baud rate is set to zero, the modem
                   control lines shall no longer be asserted. This shall  have
                   the  effect  of setting the output termios baud rate values
                   as defined in the Base Definitions volume of  POSIX.1â2017,
                   Chapter 11, General Terminal Interface.

       hupcl (-hupcl)
                   Stop  asserting  modem control lines (do not stop asserting
                   modem control lines) on last close. This shall have the efâ
                   fect  of setting (not setting) HUPCL in the termios c_cflag
                   field,  as  defined  in  the  Base  Definitions  volume  of
                   POSIX.1â2017, Chapter 11, General Terminal Interface.

       hup (-hup)  Equivalent to hupcl(-hupcl).

       cstopb (-cstopb)

             Set  the  value  of  MIN to number.  MIN is used in non-canonical
             mode input processing (icanon).

       time number
             Set the value of TIME to number.  TIME is used  in  non-canonical
             mode input processing (icanon).

   Combination Modes
       saved settings
             Set  the  current  terminal characteristics to the saved settings
             produced by the -g option.

       evenp or parity
             Enable parenb and cs7; disable parodd.

       oddp
             Enable parenb, cs7, and parodd.

       -parity, -evenp, or -oddp
             Disable parenb, and set cs8.

       raw (-raw or cooked)
             Enable (disable) raw input and output. Raw mode shall be  equivaâ
             lent to setting:

                 stty cs8 erase ^- kill ^- intr ^- \
                     quit ^- eof ^- eol ^- -post -inpck

       nl (-nl)
             Disable (enable) icrnl.  In addition, -nl unsets inlcr and igncr.

       ek    Reset ERASE and KILL characters back to system defaults.

       sane
             Reset all modes to some reasonable, unspecified, values.

STDIN
       Although  no input is read from standard input, standard input shall be
       used to get the current terminal I/O characteristics  and  to  set  new
       terminal I/O characteristics.

INPUT FILES
       None.

ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
       The following environment variables shall affect the execution of stty:

       LANG      Provide  a  default  value for the internationalization variâ
                 ables that are unset or null. (See the Base Definitions  volâ
                 ume  of POSIX.1â2017, Section 8.2, Internationalization Variâ
                 ables for the precedence  of  internationalization  variables
                 used to determine the values of locale categories.)

       LC_ALL    If  set  to  a non-empty string value, override the values of
                 all the other internationalization variables.

       LC_CTYPE  This variable determines the locale for the interpretation of
                 sequences  of  bytes of text data as characters (for example,
                 single-byte as opposed to multi-byte characters in arguments)
                 and which characters are in the class print.

       LC_MESSAGES
                 Determine the locale that should be used to affect the format
                 and contents of diagnostic messages written to  standard  erâ
                 ror.

       NLSPATH   Determine the location of message catalogs for the processing
                 of LC_MESSAGES.

ASYNCHRONOUS EVENTS
       Default.

STDOUT
       If operands are specified, no output shall be produced.

       If the -g option is specified, stty shall write to standard output  the
       current settings in a form that can be used as arguments to another inâ
       stance of stty on the same system.

       If the -a option is specified, all of the information as  described  in
       the OPERANDS section shall be written to standard output. Unless otherâ
       wise specified, this information shall be written as  <space>-separated
       tokens in an unspecified format, on one or more lines, with an unspeciâ
       fied number of tokens per line. Additional information may be written.

       If no options or operands are specified, an unspecified subset  of  the
       information written for the -a option shall be written.

       If  speed  information  is written as part of the default output, or if
       the -a option is specified and if the terminal input speed  and  output
       speed are the same, the speed information shall be written as follows:

           "speed %d baud;", <speed>

       Otherwise, speeds shall be written as:

           "ispeed %d baud; ospeed %d baud;", <ispeed>, <ospeed>

       In locales other than the POSIX locale, the word baud may be changed to
       something more appropriate in those locales.

       If control characters are written as part of the default output, or  if
       the -a option is specified, control characters shall be written as:

           "%s = %s;", <control-character name>, <value>

       where <value> is either the character, or some visual representation of
       the character if it is non-printable, or the string undef if the  charâ
       acter is disabled.

STDERR
       The standard error shall be used only for diagnostic messages.

OUTPUT FILES
       None.

EXTENDED DESCRIPTION
       None.

EXIT STATUS
       The following exit values shall be returned:

        0    The terminal options were read or set successfully.

       >0    An error occurred.

CONSEQUENCES OF ERRORS
       Default.

       The following sections are informative.

APPLICATION USAGE
       The  -g flag is designed to facilitate the saving and restoring of terâ
       minal state from the shell level. For example, a program may:

           saveterm="$(stty -g)"       # save terminal state
           stty (new settings)         # set new state
           ...                         # ...
           stty $saveterm              # restore terminal state

       Since the format is unspecified, the saved value is not portable across
       systems.

       Since  the -a format is so loosely specified, scripts that save and reâ
       store terminal settings should use the -g option.

EXAMPLES
       None.

RATIONALE
       The original stty description was taken directly from System V and  reâ
       flected  the  System V terminal driver termio.  It has been modified to
       correspond to the terminal driver termios.

       Output modes are specified only for XSI-conformant systems. All  impleâ
       mentations  are  expected to provide stty operands corresponding to all
       of the output modes they support.

       The stty utility is primarily used to tailor the user interface of  the
       terminal, such as selecting the preferred ERASE and KILL characters. As
       an application programming utility,  stty  can  be  used  within  shell
       scripts to alter the terminal settings for the duration of the script.

       The termios section states that individual disabling of control characâ
       ters is possible through the option _POSIX_VDISABLE.  If  enabled,  two
       conventions  currently  exist  for specifying this: System V uses "^-",
       and BSD uses undef.  Both are  accepted  by  stty  in  this  volume  of
       POSIX.1â2017.  The other BSD convention of using the letter 'u' was reâ
       jected because it conflicts with the actual letter 'u', which is an acâ
       ceptable value for a control character.

       Early  proposals did not specify the mapping of "^c" to control characâ
       ters because the control characters were not specified in the POSIX loâ
       cale character set description file requirements. The control character
       set is now specified in the Base Definitions  volume  of  POSIX.1â2017,
       Chapter  3,  Definitions,  so the historical mapping is specified. Note
       that although the mapping corresponds to control-character key  assignâ
       ments  on  many  terminals  that  use the ISO/IEC 646:1991 standard (or
       ASCII) character encodings, the mapping specified here is to  the  conâ
       trol characters, not their keyboard encodings.

       Since  termios  supports  separate speeds for input and output, two new
       options were added to specify each distinctly.

       Some historical implementations use standard input to get and set  terâ
       minal  characteristics;  others use standard output. Since input from a
       login TTY is usually restricted to the owner while output to a  TTY  is
       frequently  open to anyone, using standard input provides fewer chances
       of accidentally (or maliciously)  altering  the  terminal  settings  of
       other  users. Using standard input also allows stty -a and stty -g outâ
       put to be redirected for later use. Therefore, usage of standard  input
       is required by this volume of POSIX.1â2017.

FUTURE DIRECTIONS
       None.

UNIMPLEMENTED(2)              System Calls Manual             UNIMPLEMENTED(2)

NAME
       afs_syscall,  break,  fattach,  fdetach,  ftime, getmsg, getpmsg, gtty,
       isastream, lock, madvise1, mpx, prof, profil,  putmsg,  putpmsg,  secuâ
       rity, stty, tuxcall, ulimit, vserver - unimplemented system calls

SYNOPSIS
       Unimplemented system calls.

DESCRIPTION
       These system calls are not implemented in the Linux kernel.

RETURN VALUE
       These system calls always return -1 and set errno to ENOSYS.

NOTES
       Note that ftime(3), profil(3), and ulimit(3) are implemented as library
       functions.

       Some system calls,  like  alloc_hugepages(2),  free_hugepages(2),  iopâ
       erm(2), iopl(2), and vm86(2) exist only on certain architectures.

       Some  system  calls, like ipc(2), create_module(2), init_module(2), and
       delete_module(2) exist only when the Linux kernel was built  with  supâ
       port for them.
