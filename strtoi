strtoi(3bsd)                         LOCAL                        strtoi(3bsd)

NAME
     strtoi — convert string value to an intmax_t integer

LIBRARY
     Utility functions from BSD systems (libbsd, -lbsd)

SYNOPSIS
     #include <inttypes.h>
     (See libbsd(7) for include usage.)

     intmax_t
     strtoi(const char * restrict nptr, char ** restrict endptr, int base,
         intmax_t lo, intmax_t hi, int *rstatus);

DESCRIPTION
     The strtoi() function converts the string in nptr to an intmax_t value.
     The strtoi() function uses internally strtoimax(3) and ensures that the
     result is always in the range [ lo .. hi ].  In adddition it always
     places 0 on success or a conversion status in the rstatus argument,
     avoiding the errno gymnastics the other functions require.  The rstatus
     argument can be NULL if conversion status is to be ignored.

     The string may begin with an arbitrary amount of white space (as deter‐
     mined by isspace(3)) followed by a single optional ‘+’ or ‘-’ sign.  If
     base is zero or 16, the string may then include a ‘0x’ or ‘0X’ prefix,
     and the number will be read in base 16; otherwise, a zero base is taken
     as 10 (decimal) unless the next character is ‘0’, in which case it is
     taken as 8 (octal).

     The remainder of the string is converted to a intmax_t value in the obvi‐
     ous manner, stopping at the first character which is not a valid digit in
     the given base.  (In bases above 10, the letter ‘A’ in either upper or
     lower case represents 10, ‘B’ represents 11, and so forth, with ‘Z’ rep‐
     resenting 35.)

     If endptr is non-nil, strtoi() stores the address of the first invalid
     character in *endptr.  If there were no digits at all, however, strtoi()
     stores the original value of nptr in *endptr.  (Thus, if *nptr is not
     ‘\0’ but **endptr is ‘\0’ on return, the entire string was valid.)

RETURN VALUES
     The strtoi() function always returns the closest value in the range spec‐
     ified by the lo and hi arguments.

     The errno value is guaranteed to be left unchanged.

     Errors are stored as the conversion status in the rstatus argument.

EXAMPLES
     The following example will always return a number in [1..99] range no
     matter what the input is, and warn if the conversion failed.

           int e;
           intmax_t lval = strtoi(buf, NULL, 0, 1, 99, &e);
           if (e)
                   warnc(e, "conversion of `%s' to a number failed, using %jd",
                       buf, lval);

ERRORS
     [ECANCELED]        The string did not contain any characters that were
                        converted.

     [EINVAL]           The base is not between 2 and 36 and does not contain
                        the special value 0.

     [ENOTSUP]          The string contained non-numeric characters that did
                        not get converted.  In this case, endptr points to the
                        first unconverted character.

     [ERANGE]           The given string was out of range; the value converted
                        has been clamped; or the range given was invalid, i.e.
                        lo > hi.

STANDARDS
     The strtoi() function is a NetBSD extension.

HISTORY
     The strtoi() function first appeared in NetBSD 7.0.  OpenBSD introduced
     the strtonum(3bsd) function for the same purpose, but the interface makes
     it impossible to properly differentiate illegal returns.

BUGS
     Ignores the current locale.
