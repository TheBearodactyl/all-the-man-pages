NAME
       gnutls_crypto_register_digest - API function

SYNOPSIS
       #include <gnutls/crypto.h>

       int  gnutls_crypto_register_digest(gnutls_digest_algorithm_t  algorithm,  int  priority,  gnutls_digest_init_func  init, gnutls_digest_hash_func hash, gnutls_digest_output_func output, gnutls_di‐
       gest_deinit_func deinit, gnutls_digest_fast_func hash_fast);

ARGUMENTS
       gnutls_digest_algorithm_t algorithm
                   is the gnutls digest identifier

       int priority
                   is the priority of the algorithm

       gnutls_digest_init_func init
                   A function which initializes the digest

       gnutls_digest_hash_func hash
                   Perform the hash operation

       gnutls_digest_output_func output
                   Provide the output of the digest

       gnutls_digest_deinit_func deinit
                   A function which deinitializes the digest

       gnutls_digest_fast_func hash_fast
                   Perform the digest operation in one go

DESCRIPTION
       This function will register a digest algorithm to be used by gnutls.  Any algorithm registered will override the included algorithms and by convention kernel implemented algorithms have  priority
       of 90 and CPU-assisted of 80.  The algorithm with the lowest priority will be used by gnutls.

DEPRECATED
       since 3.7.0 it is no longer possible to override cipher implementation

RETURNS
       GNUTLS_E_SUCCESS on success, otherwise a negative error code.

SINCE
       3.4.0
