CURLINFO_LASTSOCKET(3)                                                                   curl_easy_getinfo options                                                                  CURLINFO_LASTSOCKET(3)

NAME
       CURLINFO_LASTSOCKET - get the last socket used

SYNOPSIS
       #include <curl/curl.h>

       CURLcode curl_easy_getinfo(CURL *handle, CURLINFO_LASTSOCKET, long *socket);

DESCRIPTION
       Deprecated since 7.45.0. Use CURLINFO_ACTIVESOCKET(3) instead.

       Pass  a  pointer  to  a  long  to  receive  the  last  socket  used  by this curl session. If the socket is no longer valid, -1 is returned. When you finish working with the socket, you must call
       curl_easy_cleanup() as usual and let libcurl close the socket and cleanup other resources associated with the handle. This is typically used in combination with CURLOPT_CONNECT_ONLY(3).

       NOTE: this API is deprecated since it is not working on win64 where the SOCKET type is 64 bits large while its 'long' is 32 bits. Use the CURLINFO_ACTIVESOCKET(3) instead, if possible.

PROTOCOLS
       All

EXAMPLE
       CURL *curl = curl_easy_init();
       if(curl) {
         long sockfd; /* does not work on win64! */
         curl_easy_setopt(curl, CURLOPT_URL, "https://example.com");

         /* Do not do the transfer - only connect to host */
         curl_easy_setopt(curl, CURLOPT_CONNECT_ONLY, 1L);
         res = curl_easy_perform(curl);

         /* Extract the socket from the curl handle */
         res = curl_easy_getinfo(curl, CURLINFO_LASTSOCKET, &sockfd);

         if(res != CURLE_OK) {
           printf("Error: %s\n", curl_easy_strerror(res));
           return 1;
         }
       }

AVAILABILITY
       Added in 7.15.2

RETURN VALUE
       Returns CURLE_OK if the option is supported, and CURLE_UNKNOWN_OPTION if not.
