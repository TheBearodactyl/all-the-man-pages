NAME
       gnutls_psk_set_server_credentials_function - API function

SYNOPSIS
       #include <gnutls/gnutls.h>

       void gnutls_psk_set_server_credentials_function(gnutls_psk_server_credentials_t         cred, gnutls_psk_server_credentials_function         * func);

ARGUMENTS
       gnutls_psk_server_credentials_t         cred
                   is a gnutls_psk_server_credentials_t type.

       gnutls_psk_server_credentials_function         * func
                   is the callback function

DESCRIPTION
       This function can be used to set a callback to retrieve the user's PSK credentials.  The callback's function form is: int (*callback)(gnutls_session_t, const char* username, gnutls_datum_t* key);

        username contains the actual username.  The  key must be filled in using the gnutls_malloc().

       In case the callback returned a negative number then gnutls will assume that the username does not exist.

       The callback function will only be called once per handshake.  The callback function should return 0 on success, while -1 indicates an error.
