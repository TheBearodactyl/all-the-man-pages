NAME
       XStoreBytes, XStoreBuffer, XFetchBytes, XFetchBuffer, XRotateBuffers - manipulate cut and paste buffers

SYNTAX
       int XStoreBytes(Display *display, _Xconst char *bytes, int nbytes);

       int XStoreBuffer(Display *display, _Xconst char *bytes, int nbytes, int buffer);

       char *XFetchBytes(Display *display, int *nbytes_return);

       char *XFetchBuffer(Display *display, int *nbytes_return, int buffer);

       int XRotateBuffers(Display *display, int rotate);

ARGUMENTS
       buffer    Specifies the buffer in which you want to store the bytes or from which you want the stored data returned.

       bytes     Specifies the bytes, which are not necessarily ASCII or null-terminated.

       display   Specifies the connection to the X server.

       nbytes    Specifies the number of bytes to be stored.

       nbytes_return
                 Returns the number of bytes in the buffer.

       rotate    Specifies how much to rotate the cut buffers.

DESCRIPTION
       The data can have embedded null characters and need not be null-terminated.  The cut buffer's contents can be retrieved later by any client calling XFetchBytes.

       XStoreBytes can generate a BadAlloc error.

       If an invalid buffer is specified, the call has no effect.  The data can have embedded null characters and need not be null-terminated.

       XStoreBuffer can generate a BadAlloc error.

       The  XFetchBytes  function  returns  the  number  of bytes in the nbytes_return argument, if the buffer contains data.  Otherwise, the function returns NULL and sets nbytes to 0.  The appropriate
       amount of storage is allocated and the pointer returned.  The client must free this storage when finished with it by calling XFree.

       The XFetchBuffer function returns zero to the nbytes_return argument if there is no data in the buffer or if an invalid buffer is specified.

       XFetchBuffer can generate a BadValue error.

       The XRotateBuffers function rotates the cut buffers, such that buffer 0 becomes buffer n, buffer 1 becomes n + 1 mod 8, and so on.  This cut buffer numbering is global to the display.  Note  that
       XRotateBuffers generates BadMatch errors if any of the eight buffers have not been created.

       XRotateBuffers can generate a BadMatch error.

DIAGNOSTICS
       BadAlloc  The server failed to allocate the requested resource or server memory.

       BadAtom   A value for an Atom argument does not name a defined Atom.

       BadMatch  Some argument or pair of arguments has the correct type and range but fails to match in some other way required by the request.

       BadValue  Some numeric value falls outside the range of values accepted by the request.  Unless a specific range is specified for an argument, the full range defined by the argument's type is ac‐
                 cepted.  Any argument defined as a set of alternatives can generate this error.
