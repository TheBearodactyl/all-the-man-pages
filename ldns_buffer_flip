NAME
       ldns_buffer_flip, ldns_buffer_rewind, ldns_buffer_position, ldns_buffer_set_position, ldns_buffer_skip - buffer positioning

SYNOPSIS
       #include <stdint.h>
       #include <stdbool.h>

       #include <ldns/ldns.h>

       void ldns_buffer_flip(ldns_buffer *buffer);

       void ldns_buffer_rewind(ldns_buffer *buffer);

       size_t ldns_buffer_position(const ldns_buffer *buffer);

       void ldns_buffer_set_position(ldns_buffer *buffer, size_t mark);

       void ldns_buffer_skip(ldns_buffer *buffer, ssize_t count);

DESCRIPTION
       ldns_buffer_flip() makes the buffer ready for reading the data that has been written to the buffer.  The buffer's limit is set to the current position and the position is set to 0.

              buffer: the buffer to flip
              Returns void

       ldns_buffer_rewind() make the buffer ready for re-reading the data.  The buffer's position is reset to 0.
              buffer: the buffer to rewind

       ldns_buffer_position() returns the current position in the buffer (as a number of bytes)
              buffer: the buffer
              Returns the current position

       ldns_buffer_set_position() sets the buffer's position to MARK.  The position must be less than or equal to the buffer's limit.
              buffer: the buffer
              mark: the mark to use

       ldns_buffer_skip() changes the buffer's position by COUNT bytes.  The position must not be moved behind the buffer's limit or before the beginning of the buffer.
              buffer: the buffer
              count: the count to use
