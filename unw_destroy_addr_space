NAME
       unw_destroy_addr_space -- destroy unwind address space

SYNOPSIS
       #include <libunwind.h>

       void unw_destroy_addr_space(unw_addr_space_t as);

DESCRIPTION
       The unw_destroy_addr_space() routine destroys the address space specified by argument as and thereby releases all associated resources (such as memory).

       Applications must not destroy the local address space unw_local_addr_space.  Attempting to do so results in undefined behavior (e.g., the application may crash).

SEE ALSO
       libunwind(3), unw_create_addr_space(3)
