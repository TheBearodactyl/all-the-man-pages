NAME
       ldns_sign_public_dsa, ldns_sign_public_rsamd5, ldns_sign_public_rsasha1 - sign buffer

SYNOPSIS
       #include <stdint.h>
       #include <stdbool.h>

       #include <ldns/ldns.h>

       ldns_rdf* ldns_sign_public_dsa(ldns_buffer *to_sign, DSA *key);

       ldns_rdf* ldns_sign_public_rsamd5(ldns_buffer *to_sign, RSA *key);

       ldns_rdf* ldns_sign_public_rsasha1(ldns_buffer *to_sign, RSA *key);

DESCRIPTION
       ldns_sign_public_dsa() Sign a buffer with the DSA key (hash with SHA1)

              to_sign: The ldns_buffer containing raw data that is to be signed
              key: The DSA key structure to sign with
              Returns a ldns_rdf for the RRSIG ldns_rr

       ldns_sign_public_rsamd5() Sign a buffer with the RSA key (hash with MD5)
              to_sign: buffer with the data
              key: the key to use
              Returns a ldns_rdf with the signed data

       ldns_sign_public_rsasha1() Sign a buffer with the RSA key (hash with SHA1)
              to_sign: buffer with the data
              key: the key to use
              Returns a ldns_rdf with the signed data
