NAME
       gnutls_ocsp_req_get_extension - API function

SYNOPSIS
       #include <gnutls/ocsp.h>

       int gnutls_ocsp_req_get_extension(gnutls_ocsp_req_const_t req, unsigned indx, gnutls_datum_t * oid, unsigned int * critical, gnutls_datum_t * data);

ARGUMENTS
       gnutls_ocsp_req_const_t req
                   should contain a gnutls_ocsp_req_t type

       unsigned indx
                   Specifies which extension OID to get. Use (0) to get the first one.

       gnutls_datum_t * oid
                   will hold newly allocated buffer with OID of extension, may be NULL

       unsigned int * critical
                   output variable with critical flag, may be NULL.

       gnutls_datum_t * data
                   will hold newly allocated buffer with extension data, may be NULL

DESCRIPTION
       This  function will return all information about the requested extension in the OCSP request.  The information returned is the OID, the critical flag, and the data itself.  The extension OID will
       be stored as a string.  Any of  oid ,  critical , and  data may be NULL which means that the caller is not interested in getting that information back.

       The caller needs to deallocate memory by calling gnutls_free() on
        oid ->data and  data ->data.

       Since 3.7.0  oid ->size does not account for the terminating null byte.

RETURNS
       On success, GNUTLS_E_SUCCESS (0) is returned, otherwise a negative error code is returned.  If you have reached the last extension  available  GNUTLS_E_REQUESTED_DATA_NOT_AVAILABLE  will  be  re‐
       turned.
