NAME
       gnutls_certificate_set_ocsp_status_request_file2 - API function

SYNOPSIS
       #include <gnutls/gnutls.h>

       int gnutls_certificate_set_ocsp_status_request_file2(gnutls_certificate_credentials_t sc, const char * response_file, unsigned idx, gnutls_x509_crt_fmt_t fmt);

ARGUMENTS
       gnutls_certificate_credentials_t sc
                   is a credentials structure.

       const char * response_file
                   a filename of the OCSP response

       unsigned idx
                   is a certificate index as returned by gnutls_certificate_set_key() and friends

       gnutls_x509_crt_fmt_t fmt
                   is PEM or DER

DESCRIPTION
       This function loads the OCSP responses to be sent to the peer for the certificate chain specified by  idx . When  fmt is set to PEM, multiple responses can be loaded.

       This  function  must  be  called after setting any certificates, and cannot be used for certificates that are provided via a callback -- that is when gnutls_certificate_set_retrieve_function() is
       used. In that case consider using gnutls_certificate_set_retrieve_function3().

       This function can be called multiple times when multiple responses applicable to the certificate chain are available.  If the response provided does not match  any  certificates  present  in  the
       chain, the code GNUTLS_E_OCSP_MISMATCH_WITH_CERTS is returned.  If the response is already expired at the time of loading the code GNUTLS_E_EXPIRED is returned.

RETURNS
       On success, the number of loaded responses is returned, otherwise a negative error code.

SINCE
       3.1.3
