NAME
       libssh2_channel_request_pty_ex - short function description

SYNOPSIS
       #include <libssh2.h>

       int  libssh2_channel_request_pty_ex(LIBSSH2_CHANNEL  *channel,  const  char  *term,  unsigned  int  term_len,  const  char *modes, unsigned int modes_len, int width, int height, int width_px, int
       height_px);

       int libssh2_channel_request_pty(LIBSSH2_CHANNEL *channel, char *term);

DESCRIPTION
       channel - Previously opened channel instance such as returned by libssh2_channel_open_ex(3)

       term - Terminal emulation (e.g. vt102, ansi, etc...)

       term_len - Length of term parameter

       modes - Terminal mode modifier values

       modes_len - Length of modes parameter.

       width - Width of pty in characters

       height - Height of pty in characters

       width_px - Width of pty in pixels

       height_px - Height of pty in pixels

       Request a PTY on an established channel. Note that this does not make sense for all channel types and may be ignored by the server despite returning success.

RETURN VALUE
       Return 0 on success or negative on failure.  It returns LIBSSH2_ERROR_EAGAIN when it would otherwise block. While LIBSSH2_ERROR_EAGAIN is a negative number, it isn't really a failure per se.

ERRORS
       LIBSSH2_ERROR_ALLOC -  An internal memory allocation call failed.

       LIBSSH2_ERROR_SOCKET_SEND - Unable to send data on socket.

       LIBSSH2_ERROR_CHANNEL_REQUEST_DENIED -
