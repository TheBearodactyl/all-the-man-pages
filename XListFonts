NAME
       XListFonts, XFreeFontNames, XListFontsWithInfo, XFreeFontInfo - obtain or free font names and information

SYNTAX
       char **XListFonts(Display *display, _Xconst char *pattern, int maxnames, int *actual_count_return);

       int XFreeFontNames(char *list[]);

       char **XListFontsWithInfo(Display *display, _Xconst char *pattern, int maxnames, int *count_return, XFontStruct **info_return);

       int XFreeFontInfo(char **names, XFontStruct *free_info, int actual_count);

ARGUMENTS
       actual_count
                 Specifies the actual number of font names.

       actual_count_return
                 Returns the actual number of font names.

       count_return
                 Returns the actual number of matched font names.

       display   Specifies the connection to the X server.

       info_return
                 Returns the font information.

       free_info Specifies the font information.

       list      Specifies the array of strings you want to free.

       maxnames  Specifies the maximum number of names to be returned.

       names     Specifies the list of font names.

       pattern   Specifies the null-terminated pattern string that can contain wildcard characters.

DESCRIPTION
       The  XListFonts  function returns an array of available font names (as controlled by the font search path; see XSetFontPath) that match the string you passed to the pattern argument.  The pattern
       string can contain any characters, but each asterisk (*) is a wildcard for any number of characters, and each question mark (?) is a wildcard for a single character.  If the pattern string is not
       in the Host Portable Character Encoding, the result is implementation-dependent.  Use of uppercase or lowercase does not matter.  Each returned string is null-terminated.  If the data returned by
       the server is in the Latin Portable Character Encoding, then the returned strings are in the Host Portable Character Encoding.  Otherwise, the result is implementation-dependent.  If there are no
       matching font names, XListFonts returns NULL.  The client should call XFreeFontNames when finished with the result to free the memory.

       The XFreeFontNames function frees the array and strings returned by XListFonts or XListFontsWithInfo.

       The  XListFontsWithInfo  function returns a list of font names that match the specified pattern and their associated font information.  The list of names is limited to size specified by maxnames.
       The information returned for each font is identical to what XLoadQueryFont would return except that the per-character metrics are not returned.  The pattern string can contain any characters, but
       each  asterisk (*) is a wildcard for any number of characters, and each question mark (?) is a wildcard for a single character.  If the pattern string is not in the Host Portable Character Encod‐
       ing, the result is implementation-dependent.  Use of uppercase or lowercase does not matter.  Each returned string is null-terminated.  If the data returned by the server is in the Latin Portable
       Character  Encoding,  then  the  returned  strings  are  in  the Host Portable Character Encoding.  Otherwise, the result is implementation-dependent.  If there are no matching font names, XList‐
       FontsWithInfo returns NULL.

       To free only the allocated name array, the client should call XFreeFontNames.  To free both the name array and the font information array or to free just the font information  array,  the  client
       should call XFreeFontInfo.

       The XFreeFontInfo function frees a font structure or an array of font structures and optionally an array of font names.  If NULL is passed for names, no font names are freed.  If a font structure
       for an open font (returned by XLoadQueryFont) is passed, the structure is freed, but the font is not closed; use XUnloadFont to close the font.

       Note that XListFontsWithInfo is not thread-safe.  If other threads make X requests on the same Display, then this function's behavior is undefined.
