NAME
       gnutls_x509_crt_get_dn - API function

SYNOPSIS
       #include <gnutls/x509.h>

       int gnutls_x509_crt_get_dn(gnutls_x509_crt_t cert, char * buf, size_t * buf_size);

ARGUMENTS
       gnutls_x509_crt_t cert
                   should contain a gnutls_x509_crt_t type

       char * buf  a pointer to a structure to hold the name (may be null)

       size_t * buf_size
                   initially holds the size of  buf

DESCRIPTION
       This  function will copy the name of the Certificate in the provided buffer. The name will be in the form "C=xxxx,O=yyyy,CN=zzzz" as described in RFC4514. The output string will be ASCII or UTF-8
       encoded, depending on the certificate data.

       The  buf returned will be null terminated and the  buf_size will account for the trailing null. If  buf is null then only the size will be filled.

       This function does not output a fully RFC4514 compliant string, if that is required see gnutls_x509_crt_get_dn3().

RETURNS
       GNUTLS_E_SHORT_MEMORY_BUFFER if the provided buffer is not long enough, and in that case the  buf_size will be updated with the required size. GNUTLS_E_REQUESTED_DATA_NOT_AVAILABLE if the DN does
       not exist, or another error value on error. On success 0 is returned.
