PCRE_MAKETABLES(3)         Library Functions Manual         PCRE_MAKETABLES(3)

NAME
       PCRE - Perl-compatible regular expressions

SYNOPSIS

       #include <pcre.h>

       const unsigned char *pcre_maketables(void);

       const unsigned char *pcre16_maketables(void);

       const unsigned char *pcre32_maketables(void);

DESCRIPTION

       This  function  builds  a  set of character tables for character values
       less than 256. These can be passed to pcre[16|32]_compile() to override
       PCRE's    internal,    built-in    tables    (which    were   made   by
       pcre[16|32]_maketables() when PCRE was compiled). You might want to  do
       this  if  you  are  using  a non-standard locale. The function yields a
       pointer to the tables.

       There is a complete description of the PCRE native API in  the  pcreapi
       page and a description of the POSIX API in the pcreposix page.
