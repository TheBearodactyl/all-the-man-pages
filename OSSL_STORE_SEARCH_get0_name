DESCRIPTION
       These functions are used to specify search criteria to help search for
       specific objects through other names than just the URI that's given to
       OSSL_STORE_open().  For example, this can be useful for an application
       that has received a URI and then wants to add on search criteria in a
       uniform and supported manner.

   Types
       OSSL_STORE_SEARCH is an opaque type that holds the constructed search
       criterion, and that can be given to an OSSL_STORE context with
       OSSL_STORE_find().

       The calling application owns the allocation of an OSSL_STORE_SEARCH at
       all times, and should therefore be careful not to deallocate it before
       OSSL_STORE_close() has been called for the OSSL_STORE context it was
       given to.

   Application Functions
       OSSL_STORE_SEARCH_by_name(), OSSL_STORE_SEARCH_by_issuer_serial(),
       OSSL_STORE_SEARCH_by_key_fingerprint(), and
       OSSL_STORE_SEARCH_by_alias() are used to create an OSSL_STORE_SEARCH
       from a subject name, an issuer name and serial number pair, a key
       fingerprint, and an alias (for example a friendly name).  The
       parameters that are provided are not copied, only referred to in a
       criterion, so they must have at least the same life time as the created
       OSSL_STORE_SEARCH.

       OSSL_STORE_SEARCH_free() is used to free the OSSL_STORE_SEARCH.

   Loader Functions
       OSSL_STORE_SEARCH_get_type() returns the criterion type for the given
       OSSL_STORE_SEARCH.

       OSSL_STORE_SEARCH_get0_name(), OSSL_STORE_SEARCH_get0_serial(),
       OSSL_STORE_SEARCH_get0_bytes(), OSSL_STORE_SEARCH_get0_string(), and
       OSSL_STORE_SEARCH_get0_digest() are used to retrieve different data
       from a OSSL_STORE_SEARCH, as available for each type.  For more
       information, see "SUPPORTED CRITERION TYPES" below.

SUPPORTED CRITERION TYPES
       Currently supported criterion types are:

       OSSL_STORE_SEARCH_BY_NAME
           This criterion supports a search by exact match of subject name.
           The subject name itself is a X509_NAME pointer.  A criterion of
           this type is created with OSSL_STORE_SEARCH_by_name(), and the
           actual subject name is retrieved with
           OSSL_STORE_SEARCH_get0_name().

       OSSL_STORE_SEARCH_BY_ISSUER_SERIAL
           This criterion supports a search by exact match of both issuer name
           and serial number.  The issuer name itself is a X509_NAME pointer,
           and the serial number is a ASN1_INTEGER pointer.  A criterion of
           this type is created with OSSL_STORE_SEARCH_by_issuer_serial() and
           the actual issuer name and serial number are retrieved with
           OSSL_STORE_SEARCH_get0_name() and OSSL_STORE_SEARCH_get0_serial().

       OSSL_STORE_SEARCH_BY_KEY_FINGERPRINT
           This criterion supports a search by exact match of key fingerprint.
           The key fingerprint in itself is a string of bytes and its length,
           as well as the algorithm that was used to compute the fingerprint.
           The digest may be left unspecified (NULL), and in that case, the
           loader has to decide on a default digest and compare fingerprints
           accordingly.  A criterion of this type is created with
           OSSL_STORE_SEARCH_by_key_fingerprint() and the actual fingerprint
           and its length can be retrieved with
           OSSL_STORE_SEARCH_get0_bytes().  The digest can be retrieved with
           OSSL_STORE_SEARCH_get0_digest().

       OSSL_STORE_SEARCH_BY_ALIAS
           This criterion supports a search by match of an alias of some kind.
           The alias in itself is a simple C string.  A criterion of this type
           is created with OSSL_STORE_SEARCH_by_alias() and the actual alias
           is retrieved with OSSL_STORE_SEARCH_get0_string().

RETURN VALUES
       OSSL_STORE_SEARCH_by_name(), OSSL_STORE_SEARCH_by_issuer_serial(),
       OSSL_STORE_SEARCH_by_key_fingerprint(), and
       OSSL_STORE_SEARCH_by_alias() return a OSSL_STORE_SEARCH pointer on
       success, or NULL on failure.

       OSSL_STORE_SEARCH_get_type() returns the criterion type of the given
       OSSL_STORE_SEARCH.  There is no error value.

       OSSL_STORE_SEARCH_get0_name() returns a X509_NAME pointer on success,
       or NULL when the given OSSL_STORE_SEARCH was of a different type.

       OSSL_STORE_SEARCH_get0_serial() returns a ASN1_INTEGER pointer on
       success, or NULL when the given OSSL_STORE_SEARCH was of a different
       type.

       OSSL_STORE_SEARCH_get0_bytes() returns a const unsigned char pointer
       and sets *length to the strings length on success, or NULL when the
       given OSSL_STORE_SEARCH was of a different type.

       OSSL_STORE_SEARCH_get0_string() returns a const char pointer on
       success, or NULL when the given OSSL_STORE_SEARCH was of a different
       type.

       OSSL_STORE_SEARCH_get0_digest() returns a const EVP_MD pointer.  NULL
       is a valid value and means that the store loader default will be used
       when applicable.
