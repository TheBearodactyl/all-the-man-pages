SYNOPSIS
       #include <stdint.h>
       #include <stdbool.h>

       #include <ldns/ldns.h>

       void ldns_rr_set_owner(ldns_rr *rr, ldns_rdf *owner);

       void ldns_rr_set_ttl(ldns_rr *rr, uint32_t ttl);

       void ldns_rr_set_type(ldns_rr *rr, ldns_rr_type rr_type);

       void ldns_rr_set_rd_count(ldns_rr *rr, size_t count);

       void ldns_rr_set_class(ldns_rr *rr, ldns_rr_class rr_class);

       ldns_rdf* ldns_rr_set_rdf(ldns_rr *rr, const ldns_rdf *f, size_t position);

DESCRIPTION
       ldns_rr_set_owner() sets the owner in the rr structure.
              *rr: rr to operate on
              *owner: set to this owner
              Returns void

       ldns_rr_set_ttl() sets the ttl in the rr structure.
              *rr: rr to operate on
              ttl: set to this ttl
              Returns void

       ldns_rr_set_type() sets the type in the rr.
              *rr: rr to operate on
              rr_type: set to this type
              Returns void

       ldns_rr_set_rd_count() sets the rd_count in the rr.
              *rr: rr to operate on
              count: set to this count
              Returns void

       ldns_rr_set_class() sets the class in the rr.
              *rr: rr to operate on
              rr_class: set to this class
              Returns void

       ldns_rr_set_rdf() sets a rdf member, it will be set on the position given. The old value is returned, like pop.
              *rr: the rr to operate on
              *f: the rdf to set
              position: the position the set the rdf
              Returns the old value in the rr, NULL on failure
