NAME
       sd_bus_slot_set_floating, sd_bus_slot_get_floating - Control whether a
       bus slot object is "floating"

SYNOPSIS
       #include <systemd/sd-bus.h>

       int sd_bus_slot_set_floating(sd_bus_slot *slot, int b);

       int sd_bus_slot_get_floating(sd_bus_slot *slot);

DESCRIPTION
       sd_bus_slot_set_floating() controls whether the specified bus slot
       object slot shall be "floating" or not. A floating bus slot object's
       lifetime is bound to the lifetime of the bus object it is associated
       with, meaning that it remains allocated as long as the bus object
       itself and is freed automatically when the bus object is freed. Regular
       (i.e. non-floating) bus slot objects keep the bus referenced, hence the
       bus object remains allocated at least as long as there remains at least
       one referenced bus slot object around. The floating state hence
       controls the direction of referencing between the bus object and the
       bus slot objects: if floating the bus pins the bus slot, and otherwise
       the bus slot pins the bus objects. Use sd_bus_slot_set_floating() to
       switch between both modes: if the b parameter is zero, the slot object
       is considered floating, otherwise it is made a regular (non-floating)
       slot object.

       Bus slot objects may be allocated with calls such as
       sd_bus_add_match(3). If the slot of these functions is non-NULL the
       slot object will be of the regular kind (i.e. non-floating), otherwise
       it will be created floating. With sd_bus_slot_set_floating() a bus slot
       object allocated as regular can be converted into a floating object and
       back. This is particularly useful for creating a bus slot object, then
       changing parameters of it, and then turning it into a floating object,
       whose lifecycle is managed by the bus object.

       sd_bus_slot_get_floating() returns the current floating state of the
       specified bus slot object. It returns negative on error, zero if the
       bus slot object is a regular (non-floating) object and positive
       otherwise.

RETURN VALUE
       On success, these functions return 0 or a positive integer. On failure,
       they return a negative errno-style error code.

   Errors
       Returned errors may indicate the following problems:

       -EINVAL
           The slot parameter is NULL.

       -ECHILD
           The bus connection has been created in a different process.

       -ESTALE
           The bus object the specified bus slot object is associated with has
           already been freed, and hence no change in the floating state can
           be made anymore.

NOTES
       These APIs are implemented as a shared library, which can be compiled
       and linked to with the libsystemd pkg-config(1) file.
