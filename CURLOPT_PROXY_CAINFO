NAME
       CURLOPT_PROXY_CAINFO - path to proxy Certificate Authority (CA) bundle

SYNOPSIS
       #include <curl/curl.h>

       CURLcode curl_easy_setopt(CURL *handle, CURLOPT_PROXY_CAINFO, char *path);

DESCRIPTION
       This option is for connecting to an HTTPS proxy, not an HTTPS server.

       Pass a char * to a null-terminated string naming a file holding one or more certificates to verify the HTTPS proxy with.

       If CURLOPT_PROXY_SSL_VERIFYPEER(3) is zero and you avoid verifying the server's certificate, CURLOPT_PROXY_CAINFO(3) need not even indicate an accessible file.

       This option is by default set to the system path where libcurl's CA certificate bundle is assumed to be stored, as established at build time.

       If curl is built against the NSS SSL library, the NSS PEM PKCS#11 module (libnsspem.so) needs to be available for this option to work properly.

       (iOS  and  macOS  only)  If curl is built against Secure Transport, then this option is supported for backward compatibility with other SSL engines, but it should not be set. If the option is not
       set, then curl will use the certificates in the system and user Keychain to verify the peer, which is the preferred method of verifying the peer's certificate chain.

       The application does not have to keep the string around after setting this option.

       The default value for this can be figured out with CURLINFO_CAINFO(3).

DEFAULT
       Built-in system specific

PROTOCOLS
       Used with HTTPS proxy

EXAMPLE
       CURL *curl = curl_easy_init();
       if(curl) {
         curl_easy_setopt(curl, CURLOPT_URL, "https://example.com/");
         /* using an HTTPS proxy */
         curl_easy_setopt(curl, CURLOPT_PROXY, "https://localhost:443");
         curl_easy_setopt(curl, CURLOPT_PROXY_CAINFO, "/etc/certs/cabundle.pem");
         ret = curl_easy_perform(curl);
         curl_easy_cleanup(curl);
       }

AVAILABILITY
       Added in 7.52.0

       For TLS backends that do not support certificate files, the CURLOPT_PROXY_CAINFO(3) option is ignored. Refer to https://curl.se/docs/ssl-compared.html

RETURN VALUE
       Returns CURLE_OK if the option is supported, CURLE_UNKNOWN_OPTION if not, or CURLE_OUT_OF_MEMORY if there was insufficient heap space.
