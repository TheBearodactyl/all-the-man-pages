NAME
       pacreport - display a summary of installed packages

SYNOPSIS
        pacreport [options]
        pacreport (--help|--version)

DESCRIPTION
       Generate a report of installed packages including:

       unneeded packages installed explicitly
       unneeded packages installed as dependencies
       unneeded packages in a dependency cycle
       installed packages not in a repository
       packages missing from specified groups
       missing package files
       unmerged backup files
       unowned files
       cache directory sizes

       Package sizes include dependencies not needed by other packages.

       Packages prefixed by an asterisk ("*") are optional dependencies for
       another package.

OPTIONS
       --config=path
           Set an alternate pacman configuration file path.

       --dbext=extension
           Set an alternate sync database extension.

       --dbpath=path
           Set an alternate database path.

       --root=path
           Set an alternate installation root.

       --sysroot=path
           Set an alternate system root.  See pacutils-sysroot(7).

       --cache-dir=path
           Set an alternate cache directory path.

       --backups
           Search for .pac{save,orig,new} files.  By default /etc is searched
           and all known config files are checked; pass twice to search
           outside /etc.

       --group=name
           Display any packages in group name that are not currently
           installed. May be specified multiple times.

       --missing-files
           Check for missing package files.

       --unowned-files
           Check for unowned files.  See /etc/pacreport.conf under FILES for
           more information.

       --optional-deps
           Take optional dependencies into account when listing unneeded
           packages and dependency loops.

       --help
           Display usage information and exit.

       --version
           Display version information and exit.

FILES
       /etc/pacreport.conf
           INI-style configuration file listing paths to ignore when run with
           --unowned-files.  Paths which should always be ignored may be
           specified with "IgnoreUnowned" in the "Options" section.  Paths
           which should only be ignored if a particular package is installed
           can be listed under the section "PkgIgnoreUnowned" using the
           package name as the option name and the path to be ignored as the
           value.  All options can be specified multiple times.  Paths may
           include shell-style globs.  The installation root should not be
           included in paths.

            [Options]
            IgnoreUnowned = home/*
            IgnoreUnowned = proc/*
            IgnoreUnowned = mnt/*

            [PkgIgnoreUnowned]
            linux = boot/initramfs-linux.img
            linux = boot/initramfs-linux-fallback.img
