NAME
       BN_security_bits - returns bits of security based on given numbers

SYNOPSIS
        #include <openssl/bn.h>

        int BN_security_bits(int L, int N);

DESCRIPTION
       BN_security_bits() returns the number of bits of security provided by a specific algorithm and a particular key size. The bits of security is defined in NIST SP800-57. Currently,
       BN_security_bits() support two types of asymmetric algorithms: the FFC (Finite Field Cryptography) and IFC (Integer Factorization Cryptography). For FFC, e.g., DSA and DH, both parameters L and N
       are used to decide the bits of security, where L is the size of the public key and N is the size of the private key. For IFC, e.g., RSA, only L is used and it's commonly considered to be the key
       size (modulus).

RETURN VALUES
       Number of security bits.

NOTES
       ECC (Elliptic Curve Cryptography) is not covered by the BN_security_bits() function. The symmetric algorithms are not covered neither.
