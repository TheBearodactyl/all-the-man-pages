NAME
       gnutls_pkcs11_obj_list_import_url4 - API function

SYNOPSIS
       #include <gnutls/pkcs11.h>

       int gnutls_pkcs11_obj_list_import_url4(gnutls_pkcs11_obj_t ** p_list, unsigned int * n_list, const char * url, unsigned int flags);

ARGUMENTS
       gnutls_pkcs11_obj_t ** p_list
                   An uninitialized object list (may be NULL)

       unsigned int * n_list
                   It will contain the size of the list.

       const char * url
                   A PKCS 11 url identifying a set of objects

       unsigned int flags
                   Or sequence of GNUTLS_PKCS11_OBJ_* flags

DESCRIPTION
       This function will enumerate all the objects specified by the PKCS11 URL provided. It will initialize and set values to the object pointer list ( p_list ) provided. To obtain a list of all avail‐
       able objects use a  url of 'pkcs11:'.

       All returned objects must be deinitialized using gnutls_pkcs11_obj_deinit(), and  p_list must be deinitialized using gnutls_free().

       The  supported  in  this  function   flags  are  GNUTLS_PKCS11_OBJ_FLAG_LOGIN,   GNUTLS_PKCS11_OBJ_FLAG_LOGIN_SO,   GNUTLS_PKCS11_OBJ_FLAG_PRESENT_IN_TRUSTED_MODULE,   GNUTLS_PKCS11_OBJ_FLAG_CRT,
       GNUTLS_PKCS11_OBJ_FLAG_PUBKEY,  GNUTLS_PKCS11_OBJ_FLAG_PRIVKEY,  GNUTLS_PKCS11_OBJ_FLAG_WITH_PRIVKEY,  GNUTLS_PKCS11_OBJ_FLAG_MARK_CA,  GNUTLS_PKCS11_OBJ_FLAG_MARK_TRUSTED,  and  since  3.5.1 the
       GNUTLS_PKCS11_OBJ_FLAG_OVERWRITE_TRUSTMOD_EXT.

       On versions of GnuTLS prior to 3.4.0 the equivalent function was gnutls_pkcs11_obj_list_import_url2(). That is also available on this version as a macro which maps to this function.

RETURNS
       On success, GNUTLS_E_SUCCESS (0) is returned, otherwise a negative error value.

SINCE
       3.4.0
