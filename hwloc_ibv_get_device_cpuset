NAME
       hwlocality_openfabrics - Interoperability with OpenFabrics

SYNOPSIS
   Functions
       static int hwloc_ibv_get_device_cpuset (hwloc_topology_t topology, struct ibv_device *ibdev, hwloc_cpuset_t set)
       static hwloc_obj_t hwloc_ibv_get_device_osdev_by_name (hwloc_topology_t topology, const char *ibname)
       static hwloc_obj_t hwloc_ibv_get_device_osdev (hwloc_topology_t topology, struct ibv_device *ibdev)

Detailed Description
       This interface offers ways to retrieve topology information about OpenFabrics devices (InfiniBand, Omni-Path, usNIC, etc).

Function Documentation
   static int hwloc_ibv_get_device_cpuset (hwloc_topology_t topology, struct ibv_device * ibdev, hwloc_cpuset_t set) [inline],  [static]
       Get the CPU set of processors that are physically close to device ibdev. Store in set the CPU-set describing the locality of the OpenFabrics device ibdev (InfiniBand, etc).

       Topology topology and device ibdev must match the local machine. I/O devices detection is not needed in the topology.

       The function only returns the locality of the device. If more information about the device is needed, OS objects should be used instead, see hwloc_ibv_get_device_osdev() and
       hwloc_ibv_get_device_osdev_by_name().

       This function is currently only implemented in a meaningful way for Linux; other systems will simply get a full cpuset.

   static hwloc_obj_t hwloc_ibv_get_device_osdev (hwloc_topology_t topology, struct ibv_device * ibdev) [inline],  [static]
       Get the hwloc OS device object corresponding to the OpenFabrics device ibdev.

       Returns
           The hwloc OS device object describing the OpenFabrics device ibdev (InfiniBand, etc).

           NULL if none could be found.

       Topology topology and device ibdev must match the local machine. I/O devices detection must be enabled in the topology. If not, the locality of the object may still be found using
       hwloc_ibv_get_device_cpuset().

       Note
           The corresponding PCI device object can be obtained by looking at the OS device parent object.

   static hwloc_obj_t hwloc_ibv_get_device_osdev_by_name (hwloc_topology_t topology, const char * ibname) [inline],  [static]
       Get the hwloc OS device object corresponding to the OpenFabrics device named ibname.

       Returns
           The hwloc OS device object describing the OpenFabrics device (InfiniBand, Omni-Path, usNIC, etc) whose name is ibname (mlx5_0, hfi1_0, usnic_0, qib0, etc).

           NULL if none could be found.

       The name ibname is usually obtained from ibv_get_device_name().

       The topology topology does not necessarily have to match the current machine. For instance the topology may be an XML import of a remote host. I/O devices detection must be enabled in the
       topology.

       Note
           The corresponding PCI device object can be obtained by looking at the OS device parent object.
