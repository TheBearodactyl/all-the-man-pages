NAME
       mkdir, mkdirat - create a directory

LIBRARY
       Standard C library (libc, -lc)

SYNOPSIS
       #include <sys/stat.h>

       int mkdir(const char *pathname, mode_t mode);

       #include <fcntl.h>           /* Definition of AT_* constants */
       #include <sys/stat.h>

       int mkdirat(int dirfd, const char *pathname, mode_t mode);

   Feature Test Macro Requirements for glibc (see feature_test_macros(7)):

       mkdirat():
           Since glibc 2.10:
               _POSIX_C_SOURCE >= 200809L
           Before glibc 2.10:
               _ATFILE_SOURCE

DESCRIPTION
       mkdir() attempts to create a directory named pathname.

       The argument mode specifies the mode for the new directory (see inode(7)).  It is modified by the process's umask in the usual way: in the absence of a default ACL, the mode of the created direc‐
       tory is (mode & ~umask & 0777).  Whether other mode bits are honored for the created directory depends on the operating system.  For Linux, see NOTES below.

       The newly created directory will be owned by the effective user ID of the process.  If the directory containing the file has the set-group-ID bit set, or if the filesystem  is  mounted  with  BSD
       group  semantics  (mount -o bsdgroups or, synonymously mount -o grpid), the new directory will inherit the group ownership from its parent; otherwise it will be owned by the effective group ID of
       the process.

       If the parent directory has the set-group-ID bit set, then so will the newly created directory.

   mkdirat()
       The mkdirat() system call operates in exactly the same way as mkdir(), except for the differences described here.

       If the pathname given in pathname is relative, then it is interpreted relative to the directory referred to by the file descriptor dirfd (rather than relative to the current working directory  of
       the calling process, as is done by mkdir() for a relative pathname).

       If pathname is relative and dirfd is the special value AT_FDCWD, then pathname is interpreted relative to the current working directory of the calling process (like mkdir()).

       If pathname is absolute, then dirfd is ignored.

       See openat(2) for an explanation of the need for mkdirat().

RETURN VALUE
       mkdir() and mkdirat() return zero on success.  On error, -1 is returned and errno is set to indicate the error.

ERRORS
       EACCES The parent directory does not allow write permission to the process, or one of the directories in pathname did not allow search permission.  (See also path_resolution(7).)

       EBADF  (mkdirat()) pathname is relative but dirfd is neither AT_FDCWD nor a valid file descriptor.

       EDQUOT The user's quota of disk blocks or inodes on the filesystem has been exhausted.

       EEXIST pathname already exists (not necessarily as a directory).  This includes the case where pathname is a symbolic link, dangling or not.

       EFAULT pathname points outside your accessible address space.

       EINVAL The final component ("basename") of the new directory's pathname is invalid (e.g., it contains characters not permitted by the underlying filesystem).

       ELOOP  Too many symbolic links were encountered in resolving pathname.

       EMLINK The number of links to the parent directory would exceed LINK_MAX.

       ENAMETOOLONG
              pathname was too long.

       ENOENT A directory component in pathname does not exist or is a dangling symbolic link.

       ENOMEM Insufficient kernel memory was available.

       ENOSPC The device containing pathname has no room for the new directory.

       ENOSPC The new directory cannot be created because the user's disk quota is exhausted.

       ENOTDIR
              A component used as a directory in pathname is not, in fact, a directory.

       ENOTDIR
              (mkdirat()) pathname is relative and dirfd is a file descriptor referring to a file other than a directory.

       EPERM  The filesystem containing pathname does not support the creation of directories.

       EROFS  pathname refers to a file on a read-only filesystem.

VERSIONS
       Under Linux, apart from the permission bits, the S_ISVTX mode bit is also honored.

   glibc notes
       On  older kernels where mkdirat() is unavailable, the glibc wrapper function falls back to the use of mkdir().  When pathname is a relative pathname, glibc constructs a pathname based on the sym‐
       bolic link in /proc/self/fd that corresponds to the dirfd argument.

NAME
       mkdir, mkdirat — make a directory

SYNOPSIS
       #include <sys/stat.h>

       int mkdir(const char *path, mode_t mode);

       #include <fcntl.h>

       int mkdirat(int fd, const char *path, mode_t mode);

DESCRIPTION
       The mkdir() function shall create a new directory with name path.  The file permission bits of the new directory shall be initialized from mode.  These file permission bits of the  mode  argument
       shall be modified by the process' file creation mask.

       When bits in mode other than the file permission bits are set, the meaning of these additional bits is implementation-defined.

       The directory's user ID shall be set to the process' effective user ID.  The directory's group ID shall be set to the group ID of the parent directory or to the effective group ID of the process.
       Implementations shall provide a way to initialize the directory's group ID to the group ID of the parent directory. Implementations may, but need not, provide  an  implementation-defined  way  to
       initialize the directory's group ID to the effective group ID of the calling process.

       The newly created directory shall be an empty directory.

       If path names a symbolic link, mkdir() shall fail and set errno to [EEXIST].

       Upon  successful  completion, mkdir() shall mark for update the last data access, last data modification, and last file status change timestamps of the directory. Also, the last data modification
       and last file status change timestamps of the directory that contains the new entry shall be marked for update.

       The mkdirat() function shall be equivalent to the mkdir() function except in the case where path specifies a relative path. In this case the newly created directory is created relative to the di‐
       rectory  associated  with the file descriptor fd instead of the current working directory. If the access mode of the open file description associated with the file descriptor is not O_SEARCH, the
       function shall check whether directory searches are permitted using the current permissions of the directory underlying the file descriptor. If the access mode is O_SEARCH, the function shall not
       perform the check.

       If mkdirat() is passed the special value AT_FDCWD in the fd parameter, the current working directory shall be used and the behavior shall be identical to a call to mkdir().

RETURN VALUE
       Upon successful completion, these functions shall return 0.  Otherwise, these functions shall return -1 and set errno to indicate the error. If -1 is returned, no directory shall be created.

ERRORS
       These functions shall fail if:

       EACCES Search permission is denied on a component of the path prefix, or write permission is denied on the parent directory of the directory to be created.

       EEXIST The named file exists.

       ELOOP  A loop exists in symbolic links encountered during resolution of the path argument.

       EMLINK The link count of the parent directory would exceed {LINK_MAX}.

       ENAMETOOLONG
              The length of a component of a pathname is longer than {NAME_MAX}.

       ENOENT A component of the path prefix specified by path does not name an existing directory or path is an empty string.

       ENOSPC The file system does not contain enough space to hold the contents of the new directory or to extend the parent directory of the new directory.

       ENOTDIR
              A component of the path prefix names an existing file that is neither a directory nor a symbolic link to a directory.

       EROFS  The parent directory resides on a read-only file system.

       In addition, the mkdirat() function shall fail if:

       EACCES The access mode of the open file description associated with fd is not O_SEARCH and the permissions of the directory underlying fd do not permit directory searches.

       EBADF  The path argument does not specify an absolute path and the fd argument is neither AT_FDCWD nor a valid file descriptor open for reading or searching.

       ENOTDIR
              The path argument is not an absolute path and fd is a file descriptor associated with a non-directory file.

       These functions may fail if:

       ELOOP  More than {SYMLOOP_MAX} symbolic links were encountered during resolution of the path argument.

       ENAMETOOLONG
              The length of a pathname exceeds {PATH_MAX}, or pathname resolution of a symbolic link produced an intermediate result with a length that exceeds {PATH_MAX}.

       The following sections are informative.

EXAMPLES
   Creating a Directory
       The following example shows how to create a directory named /home/cnd/mod1, with read/write/search permissions for owner and group, and with read/search permissions for others.

           #include <sys/types.h>
           #include <sys/stat.h>

           int status;
           ...
           status = mkdir("/home/cnd/mod1", S_IRWXU | S_IRWXG | S_IROTH | S_IXOTH);

APPLICATION USAGE
       None.

RATIONALE
       The mkdir() function originated in 4.2 BSD and was added to System V in Release 3.0.

       4.3 BSD detects [ENAMETOOLONG].

       The  POSIX.1‐1990  standard required that the group ID of a newly created directory be set to the group ID of its parent directory or to the effective group ID of the creating process. FIPS 151‐2
       required that implementations provide a way to have the group ID be set to the group ID of the containing directory, but did not prohibit implementations also supporting a way to set the group ID
       to  the effective group ID of the creating process.  Conforming applications should not assume which group ID will be used. If it matters, an application can use chown() to set the group ID after
       the directory is created, or determine under what conditions the implementation will set the desired group ID.

       The purpose of the mkdirat() function is to create a directory in directories other than the current working directory without exposure to race conditions. Any part of the path of a file could be
       changed in parallel to the call to mkdir(), resulting in unspecified behavior. By opening a file descriptor for the target directory and using the mkdirat() function it can be guaranteed that the
       newly created directory is located relative to the desired directory.

FUTURE DIRECTIONS
       None.
