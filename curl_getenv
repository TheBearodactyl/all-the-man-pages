NAME
       curl_getenv - return value for environment name

SYNOPSIS
       #include <curl/curl.h>

       char *curl_getenv(const char *name);

DESCRIPTION
       curl_getenv() is a portable wrapper for the getenv() function, meant to emulate its behavior and provide an identical interface for all operating systems libcurl builds on (including win32).

       You must curl_free(3) the returned string when you are done with it.

EXAMPLE
         char *width = curl_getenv("COLUMNS");
         if(width) {
           /* it was set! */
           curl_free(width);
         }

AVAILABILITY
       Always

RETURN VALUE
       A pointer to a null-terminated string or NULL if it failed to find the specified name.

NOTE
       Under  unix  operating  systems,  there is no point in returning an allocated memory, although other systems will not work properly if this is not done. The unix implementation thus has to suffer
       slightly from the drawbacks of other systems.
