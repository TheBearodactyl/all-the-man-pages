NAME
     zip_source_file, zip_source_file_create â€” create data source from a file

LIBRARY
     libzip (-lzip)

SYNOPSIS
     #include <zip.h>

     zip_source_t *
     zip_source_file(zip_t *archive, const char *fname, zip_uint64_t start, zip_int64_t len);

     zip_source_t *
     zip_source_file_create(const char *fname, zip_uint64_t start, zip_int64_t len, zip_error_t *error);

DESCRIPTION
     The functions zip_source_file() and zip_source_file_create() create a zip source from a file.  They open fname and read len bytes from offset start from it.  If len is 0 or -1, the whole file
     (starting from start) is used.

     If the file supports seek, the source can be used to open a zip archive from.

     The file is opened and read when the data from the source is used, usually by zip_close() or zip_open_from_source().

RETURN VALUES
     Upon successful completion, the created source is returned.  Otherwise, NULL is returned and the error code in archive or error is set to indicate the error.

ERRORS
     zip_source_file() and zip_source_file_create() fail if:

     [ZIP_ER_INVAL]     fname, start, or len are invalid.

     [ZIP_ER_MEMORY]    Required memory could not be allocated.

     [ZIP_ER_OPEN]      Opening fname failed.

HISTORY
     zip_source_file() and zip_source_file_create() were added in libzip 1.0.
