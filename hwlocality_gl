NAME
       hwlocality_gl - Interoperability with OpenGL displays

SYNOPSIS
   Functions
       static hwloc_obj_t hwloc_gl_get_display_osdev_by_port_device (hwloc_topology_t topology, unsigned port, unsigned device)
       static hwloc_obj_t hwloc_gl_get_display_osdev_by_name (hwloc_topology_t topology, const char *name)
       static int hwloc_gl_get_display_by_osdev (hwloc_topology_t topology, hwloc_obj_t osdev, unsigned *port, unsigned *device)

Detailed Description
       This interface offers ways to retrieve topology information about OpenGL displays.

       Only the NVIDIA display locality information is currently available, using the NV-CONTROL X11 extension and the NVCtrl library.

Function Documentation
   static int hwloc_gl_get_display_by_osdev (hwloc_topology_t topology, hwloc_obj_t osdev, unsigned * port, unsigned * device) [inline],  [static]
       Get the OpenGL display port and device corresponding to the given hwloc OS object. Retrieves the OpenGL display port (server) in port and device (screen) in screen that correspond to the given
       hwloc OS device object.

       Returns
           -1 if none could be found.

       The topology topology does not necessarily have to match the current machine. For instance the topology may be an XML import of a remote host. I/O devices detection and the GL component must be
       enabled in the topology.

   static hwloc_obj_t hwloc_gl_get_display_osdev_by_name (hwloc_topology_t topology, const char * name) [inline],  [static]
       Get the hwloc OS device object corresponding to the OpenGL display given by name.

       Returns
           The hwloc OS device object describing the OpenGL display whose name is name, built as ':port.device' such as ':0.0' .

           NULL if none could be found.

       The topology topology does not necessarily have to match the current machine. For instance the topology may be an XML import of a remote host. I/O devices detection and the GL component must be
       enabled in the topology.

       Note
           The corresponding PCI device object can be obtained by looking at the OS device parent object (unless PCI devices are filtered out).

   static hwloc_obj_t hwloc_gl_get_display_osdev_by_port_device (hwloc_topology_t topology, unsigned port, unsigned device) [inline],  [static]
       Get the hwloc OS device object corresponding to the OpenGL display given by port and device index.

       Returns
           The hwloc OS device object describing the OpenGL display whose port (server) is port and device (screen) is device.

           NULL if none could be found.

       The topology topology does not necessarily have to match the current machine. For instance the topology may be an XML import of a remote host. I/O devices detection and the GL component must be
       enabled in the topology.

       Note
           The corresponding PCI device object can be obtained by looking at the OS device parent object (unless PCI devices are filtered out).
