NAME
       gnutls_transport_set_push_function - API function

SYNOPSIS
       #include <gnutls/gnutls.h>

       void gnutls_transport_set_push_function(gnutls_session_t session, gnutls_push_func push_func);

ARGUMENTS
       gnutls_session_t session
                   is a gnutls_session_t type.

       gnutls_push_func push_func
                   a callback function similar to write()

DESCRIPTION
       This is the function where you set a push function for gnutls to use in order to send data.  If you are going to use berkeley style sockets, you do not need to use this function since the default
       send(2) will probably be ok.  Otherwise you should specify this function for gnutls to be able to send data.  The callback should return a positive number indicating the bytes sent, and -1 on er‐
       ror.

        push_func is of the form, ssize_t (*gnutls_push_func)(gnutls_transport_ptr_t, const void*, size_t);
