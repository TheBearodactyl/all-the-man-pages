POLYBAR-MSG(1)                Polybar User Manual               POLYBAR-MSG(1)

NAME
       polybar-msg - Send IPC messages to polybar

SYNOPSIS
       polybar-msg [OPTIONS] action action-string
       polybar-msg [OPTIONS] action module action [data]
       polybar-msg [OPTIONS] cmd command

DESCRIPTION
       Polybar  allows external control through actions and commands.  Actions
       control individual modules and commands control the bar itself.

       The full IPC documentation is linked at the end of this document.

       The available actions depend on the target module.   For  actions,  the
       payload is either a single action string or the module name, the action
       name, and the optional data string specified separately.

       In order for polybar-msg being able to send  a  message  to  a  running
       polybar process, the bar must have IPC enabled and both polybar-msg and
       polybar must run under the same user.

OPTIONS
       -h, --help
              Display help text and exit

       -p PID Send message only to polybar process  running  under  the  given
              process  ID.   If not specified, the message is sent to all run‐
              ning polybar processes.

EXAMPLES
       polybar-msg cmd quit
              Terminate all running polybar instances.

       polybar-msg action mymodule module_hide

       polybar-msg action "#mymodule.module_hide"
              Hide the module named mymodule.  The first variant specifies the
              module  and  action  names separately, the second uses an action
              string.
