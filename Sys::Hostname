Sys::Hostname(3perl)   Perl Programmers Reference Guide   Sys::Hostname(3perl)

NAME
       Sys::Hostname - Try every conceivable way to get hostname

SYNOPSIS
           use Sys::Hostname;
           $host = hostname;

DESCRIPTION
       Attempts several methods of getting the system hostname and then caches
       the result.  It tries the first available of the C library's
       gethostname(), "`$Config{aphostname}`", uname(2),
       "syscall(SYS_gethostname)", "`hostname`", "`uname -n`", and the file
       /com/host.  If all that fails it "croak"s.

       All NULs, returns, and newlines are removed from the result.
