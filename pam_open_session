PAM_OPEN_SESSION(3)            Linux-PAM Manual            PAM_OPEN_SESSION(3)

NAME
       pam_open_session - start PAM session management

SYNOPSIS
       #include <security/pam_appl.h>

       int pam_open_session(pam_handle_t *pamh, int flags);

DESCRIPTION
       The pam_open_session function sets up a user session for a previously
       successful authenticated user. The session should later be terminated
       with a call to pam_close_session(3).

       It should be noted that the effective uid, geteuid(2). of the
       application should be of sufficient privilege to perform such tasks as
       creating or mounting the user's home directory for example.

       The flags argument is the binary or of zero or more of the following
       values:

       PAM_SILENT
           Do not emit any messages.

RETURN VALUES
       PAM_ABORT
           General failure.

       PAM_BUF_ERR
           Memory buffer error.

       PAM_SESSION_ERR
           Session failure.

       PAM_SUCCESS
           Session was successful created.
