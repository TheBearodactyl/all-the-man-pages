NAME
     zip_register_cancel_callback_with_state â€” allow cancelling during zip_close

LIBRARY
     libzip (-lzip)

SYNOPSIS
     #include <zip.h>

     typedef int (*zip_cancel_callback)(zip_t *, void *);

     void
     zip_register_cancel_callback_with_state(zip_t *archive, zip_cancel_callback callback, void (*ud_free)(void *), void *ud);

DESCRIPTION
     This function can be used to cancel writing of a zip archive during zip_close(3).

     The zip_register_cancel_callback_with_state() function registers a callback function callback for the zip archive archive.  The ud_free function is called during cleanup for deleting the userdata
     supplied in ud.

     The callback function is called during zip_close(3) in regular intervals (after every zip archive entry that's completely written to disk, and while writing data for entries) with zip archive
     archive and the user-provided user-data ud as arguments.  When the callback function returns a non-zero value, writing is cancelled and zip_close(3) returns an error.

     The callback function should be fast, since it will be called often.
