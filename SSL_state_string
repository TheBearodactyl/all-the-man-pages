SSL_STATE_STRING(3ssl)              OpenSSL             SSL_STATE_STRING(3ssl)

NAME
       SSL_state_string, SSL_state_string_long - get textual description of
       state of an SSL object

SYNOPSIS
        #include <openssl/ssl.h>

        const char *SSL_state_string(const SSL *ssl);
        const char *SSL_state_string_long(const SSL *ssl);

DESCRIPTION
       SSL_state_string() returns an abbreviated string indicating the current
       state of the SSL object ssl. The returned NUL-terminated string
       contains 6 or fewer characters.

       SSL_state_string_long() returns a descriptive string indicating the
       current state of the SSL object ssl.

NOTES
       During its use, an SSL objects passes several states. The state is
       internally maintained. Querying the state information is not very
       informative before or when a connection has been established. It
       however can be of significant interest during the handshake.

       When using nonblocking sockets, the function call performing the
       handshake may return with SSL_ERROR_WANT_READ or SSL_ERROR_WANT_WRITE
       condition, so that SSL_state_string[_long]() may be called.

       For both blocking or nonblocking sockets, the details state information
       can be used within the info_callback function set with the
       SSL_set_info_callback() call.

RETURN VALUES
       Detailed description of possible states to be included later.
