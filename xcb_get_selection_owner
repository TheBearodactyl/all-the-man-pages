       response_type

RETURN VALUE
       Returns an xcb_get_selection_owner_cookie_t. Errors have to be handled when calling the reply function xcb_get_selection_owner_reply.

       If you want to handle errors in the event loop instead, use xcb_get_selection_owner_unchecked. See xcb-requests(3) for details.

ERRORS

                 selection does not refer to a valid atom.
