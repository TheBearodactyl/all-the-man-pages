Detailed Description
       This interface offers ways to retrieve topology information about CUDA devices when using the CUDA Driver API.

Function Documentation
   static int hwloc_cuda_get_device_cpuset (hwloc_topology_t topology, CUdevice cudevice, hwloc_cpuset_t set) [inline],  [static]
       Get the CPU set of processors that are physically close to device cudevice. Store in set the CPU-set describing the locality of the CUDA device cudevice.

       Topology topology and device cudevice must match the local machine. I/O devices detection and the CUDA component are not needed in the topology.

       The function only returns the locality of the device. If more information about the device is needed, OS objects should be used instead, see hwloc_cuda_get_device_osdev() and
       hwloc_cuda_get_device_osdev_by_index().

       This function is currently only implemented in a meaningful way for Linux; other systems will simply get a full cpuset.

   static hwloc_obj_t hwloc_cuda_get_device_osdev (hwloc_topology_t topology, CUdevice cudevice) [inline],  [static]
       Get the hwloc OS device object corresponding to CUDA device cudevice.

       Returns
           The hwloc OS device object that describes the given CUDA device cudevice.

           NULL if none could be found.

       Topology topology and device cudevice must match the local machine. I/O devices detection and the CUDA component must be enabled in the topology. If not, the locality of the object may still be
       found using hwloc_cuda_get_device_cpuset().

       Note
           This function cannot work if PCI devices are filtered out.

           The corresponding hwloc PCI device may be found by looking at the result parent pointer (unless PCI devices are filtered out).

   static hwloc_obj_t hwloc_cuda_get_device_osdev_by_index (hwloc_topology_t topology, unsigned idx) [inline],  [static]
       Get the hwloc OS device object corresponding to the CUDA device whose index is idx.

       Returns
           The hwloc OS device object describing the CUDA device whose index is idx.

           NULL if none could be found.

       The topology topology does not necessarily have to match the current machine. For instance the topology may be an XML import of a remote host. I/O devices detection and the CUDA component must be
       enabled in the topology.

       Note
           The corresponding PCI device object can be obtained by looking at the OS device parent object (unless PCI devices are filtered out).

           This function is identical to hwloc_cudart_get_device_osdev_by_index().

   static int hwloc_cuda_get_device_pci_ids (hwloc_topology_t topology, CUdevice cudevice, int * domain, int * bus, int * dev) [inline],  [static]
       Return the domain, bus and device IDs of the CUDA device cudevice. Device cudevice must match the local machine.

   static hwloc_obj_t hwloc_cuda_get_device_pcidev (hwloc_topology_t topology, CUdevice cudevice) [inline],  [static]
       Get the hwloc PCI device object corresponding to the CUDA device cudevice.

       Returns
           The hwloc PCI device object describing the CUDA device cudevice.

           NULL if none could be found.

       Topology topology and device cudevice must match the local machine. I/O devices detection must be enabled in topology topology. The CUDA component is not needed in the topology.
