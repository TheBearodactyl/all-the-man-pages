NAME
       XkbAllocGeomProps - Allocate geometry properties

SYNOPSIS
       Status XkbAllocGeomProps (XkbGeometryPtr geom, int num_needed);

ARGUMENTS
       geom   geometry for which properties should be allocated

       num_needed
              number of new properties required

DESCRIPTION
       Xkb  provides a number of functions to allocate and free subcomponents of a keyboard geometry. Use these functions to create or modify keyboard geometries.  Note that these functions merely allo‐
       cate space for the new element(s), and it is up to you to fill in the values explicitly in your code. These allocation functions increase sz_* but never touch num_* (unless there is an allocation
       failure,  in which case they reset both sz_* and num_* to zero). These functions return Success if they succeed, BadAlloc if they are not able to allocate space, or BadValue if a parameter is not
       as expected.

       XkbAllocGeomProps allocates space for num_needed properties and adds them to the specified geometry geom.  No initialization of the properties is done. A geometry property associates an arbitrary
       string with an equally arbitrary name. Geometry properties can be used to provide hints to programs that display images of keyboards, but they are not interpreted by Xkb. No other geometry struc‐
       tures refer to geometry properties.

DIAGNOSTICS
       BadAlloc       Unable to allocate storage

       BadValue       An argument is out of range
