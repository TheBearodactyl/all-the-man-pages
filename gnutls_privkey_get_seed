NAME
       gnutls_privkey_get_seed - API function

SYNOPSIS
       #include <gnutls/abstract.h>

       int gnutls_privkey_get_seed(gnutls_privkey_t key, gnutls_digest_algorithm_t * digest, void * seed, size_t * seed_size);

ARGUMENTS
       gnutls_privkey_t key
                   should contain a gnutls_privkey_t type

       gnutls_digest_algorithm_t * digest
                   if non-NULL it will contain the digest algorithm used for key generation (if applicable)

       void * seed where seed will be copied to

       size_t * seed_size
                   originally holds the size of  seed , will be updated with actual size

DESCRIPTION
       This function will return the seed that was used to generate the given private key. That function will succeed only if the key was generated as a provable key.

RETURNS
       On success, GNUTLS_E_SUCCESS (0) is returned, otherwise a negative error value.

SINCE
       3.5.0
