NAME
       gnutls_transport_set_pull_timeout_function - API function

SYNOPSIS
       #include <gnutls/gnutls.h>

       void gnutls_transport_set_pull_timeout_function(gnutls_session_t session, gnutls_pull_timeout_func func);

ARGUMENTS
       gnutls_session_t session
                   is a gnutls_session_t type.

       gnutls_pull_timeout_func func
                   a callback function

DESCRIPTION
       This is the function where you set a function for gnutls to know whether data are ready to be received. It should wait for data a given time frame in milliseconds. The callback should return 0 on
       timeout, a positive number if data can be received, and -1 on error.  You'll need to override this function if select() is not suitable for the provided transport calls.

       As with select(), if the timeout value is zero the callback should return zero if no data are immediately available. The special value GNUTLS_INDEFINITE_TIMEOUT indicates that the callback should
       wait indefinitely for data.

        gnutls_pull_timeout_func is of the form, int (*gnutls_pull_timeout_func)(gnutls_transport_ptr_t, unsigned int ms);

       This callback is necessary when gnutls_handshake_set_timeout() or gnutls_record_set_timeout() are set, under TLS1.3 and for enforcing the DTLS mode timeouts when in blocking mode.

       For  compatibility with future GnuTLS versions this callback must be set when a custom pull function is registered. The callback will not be used when the session is in TLS mode with non-blocking
       sockets. That is, when GNUTLS_NONBLOCK is specified for a TLS session in gnutls_init().

       The helper function gnutls_system_recv_timeout() is provided to simplify writing callbacks.

SINCE
       3.0
