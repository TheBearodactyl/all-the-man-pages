       The following sections are informative.

APPLICATION USAGE
       This utility is typically used in shell scripts, as shown in the EXAMPLES section. The special built-in utility : is sometimes more efficient than true.

EXAMPLES
       This command is executed forever:

           while true
           do
               command
           done

RATIONALE
       The true utility has been retained in this volume of POSIX.1‐2017, even though the shell special built-in : provides similar functionality, because true is widely used in historical  scripts  and
       is less cryptic to novice script readers.

FUTURE DIRECTIONS
       None.
