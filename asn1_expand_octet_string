NAME
       asn1_expand_octet_string - API function

SYNOPSIS
       #include <libtasn1.h>

       int asn1_expand_octet_string(asn1_node_const definitions, asn1_node * element, const char * octetName, const char * objectName);

ARGUMENTS
       asn1_node_const definitions
                   ASN1 definitions

       asn1_node * element
                   pointer to an ASN1 structure

       const char * octetName
                   name of the OCTECT STRING field to expand.

       const char * objectName
                   name of the OBJECT IDENTIFIER field to use to define the type for expansion.

DESCRIPTION
       Expands  an "OCTET STRING" element of a structure created from a DER decoding process (the asn1_der_decoding() function).  The type used for expansion is the first one following the definition of
       the actual value of the OBJECT IDENTIFIER indicated by OBJECTNAME.

RETURNS
       ASN1_SUCCESS if substitution OK, ASN1_ELEMENT_NOT_FOUND if  objectName or  octetName are not correct, ASN1_VALUE_NOT_VALID if it wasn't possible to find the type to use for  expansion,  or  other
       errors depending on DER decoding.
