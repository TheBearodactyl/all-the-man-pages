NAME
       Date::Language::Bulgarian - localization for Date::Format

DESCRIPTION
       This is Bulgarian localization for Date::Format.  It is important to note that this module source code is in utf8.  All strings which it outputs are in utf8, so it is safe to use it currently
       only with English. You are left alone to try and convert the output when using different Date::Language::* in the same application.  This should be addresed in the future.

SYNOPSIS
           use strict;
           use warnings;
           use Date::Language;
           local $\=$/;
           my $template ='%a %b %e %T %Y (%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S)';
           my $time=1290883821; #or just use time();
           my @lt = localtime($time);
           my %languages = qw(English GMT German EEST Bulgarian EET);
           binmode(select,':utf8');

           foreach my $l(keys %languages){
               my $lang = Date::Language->new($l);
               my $zone = $languages{$l};
               print $/. "$l $zone";
               print $lang->time2str($template, $time);
               print $lang->time2str($template, $time, $zone);

               print $lang->strftime($template, \@lt);
           }
