ARES_SET_SERVERS(3)                                                                      Library Functions Manual                                                                      ARES_SET_SERVERS(3)

NAME
       ares_set_servers, ares_set_servers_ports - Initialize an ares_channel name servers configuration

SYNOPSIS
       #include <ares.h>

       int ares_set_servers(ares_channel channel,
                            struct ares_addr_node *servers)

       int ares_set_servers_ports(ares_channel channel,
                                  struct ares_addr_port_node *servers)

DESCRIPTION
       The  ares_set_servers(3) function initializes name servers configuration for the channel data identified by channel, from a servers pointer to a linked list of ares_addr_node structs holding name
       servers address data.

       The name server linked list pointer argument may be the result of a previous call to ares_get_servers(3) or a linked list of ares_addr_node structs set up by other means.

       The ares_set_servers(3) function also allows the specification of UDP and TCP ports to be used for communication on a per-server basis.  The provided linked list argument may be the result  of  a
       previous call to ares_get_servers_ports(3) or a linked list of ares_addr_port_node structs set up by other means.

       This  function  replaces  any potentially previously configured name servers with the ones given in the linked list. So, in order to configure a channel with more than one name server all the de‚Äê
       sired ones must be specified in a single list.

       The function does not take ownership of the linked list argument.  The caller is responsible for freeing the linked list when no longer needed.

       This function is capable of handling IPv4 and IPv6 name server addresses simultaneously, rendering ares_init_options(3) with optmask ARES_OPT_SERVERS functionally obsolete  except  for  IPv4-only
       name server usage.

RETURN VALUES
       ares_set_servers(3) may return any of the following values:

       ARES_SUCCESS   The name servers configuration was successfully initialized.

       ARES_ENOMEM    The process's available memory was exhausted.

       ARES_ENODATA   The channel data identified by channel was invalid.

       ARES_ENOTINITIALIZED
                      c-ares library initialization not yet performed.

       ARES_ENOTIMP   Changing name servers configuration while queries are outstanding is not implemented.
