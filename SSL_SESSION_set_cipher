SSL_SESSION_GET0_CIPHER(3ssl)       OpenSSL      SSL_SESSION_GET0_CIPHER(3ssl)

NAME
       SSL_SESSION_get0_cipher, SSL_SESSION_set_cipher - set and retrieve the
       SSL cipher associated with a session

SYNOPSIS
        #include <openssl/ssl.h>

        const SSL_CIPHER *SSL_SESSION_get0_cipher(const SSL_SESSION *s);
        int SSL_SESSION_set_cipher(SSL_SESSION *s, const SSL_CIPHER *cipher);

DESCRIPTION
       SSL_SESSION_get0_cipher() retrieves the cipher that was used by the
       connection when the session was created, or NULL if it cannot be
       determined.

       The value returned is a pointer to an object maintained within s and
       should not be released.

       SSL_SESSION_set_cipher() can be used to set the ciphersuite associated
       with the SSL_SESSION s to cipher. For example, this could be used to
       set up a session based PSK (see
       SSL_CTX_set_psk_use_session_callback(3)).

RETURN VALUES
       SSL_SESSION_get0_cipher() returns the SSL_CIPHER associated with the
       SSL_SESSION or NULL if it cannot be determined.

       SSL_SESSION_set_cipher() returns 1 on success or 0 on failure.
