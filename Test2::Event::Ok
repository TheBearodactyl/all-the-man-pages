NAME
       Test2::Event::Ok - Ok event type

DESCRIPTION
       Ok events are generated whenever you run a test that produces a result.  Examples are "ok()", and "is()".

SYNOPSIS
           use Test2::API qw/context/;
           use Test2::Event::Ok;

           my $ctx = context();
           my $event = $ctx->ok($bool, $name, \@diag);

       or:

           my $ctx   = context();
           my $event = $ctx->send_event(
               'Ok',
               pass => $bool,
               name => $name,
           );

ACCESSORS
       $rb = $e->pass
           The original true/false value of whatever was passed into the event (but reduced down to 1 or 0).

       $name = $e->name
           Name of the test.

       $b = $e->effective_pass
           This is the true/false value of the test after TODO and similar modifiers are taken into account.
