NAME
       pl2pm - Rough tool to translate Perl4 .pl files to Perl5 .pm modules.

SYNOPSIS
       pl2pm files

DESCRIPTION
       pl2pm is a tool to aid in the conversion of Perl4-style .pl library
       files to Perl5-style library modules.  Usually, your old .pl file will
       still work fine and you should only use this tool if you plan to update
       your library to use some of the newer Perl 5 features, such as
       AutoLoading.

LIMITATIONS
       It's just a first step, but it's usually a good first step.
