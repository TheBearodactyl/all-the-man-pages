DESCRIPTION
       The nearbyint(), nearbyintf(), and nearbyintl() functions  round  their
       argument  to  an integer value in floating-point format, using the cur‐
       rent rounding direction (see fesetround(3)) and without raising the in‐
       exact  exception.   When  the current rounding direction is to nearest,
       these functions round halfway cases to the even integer  in  accordance
       with IEEE-754.

       The  rint(), rintf(), and rintl() functions do the same, but will raise
       the inexact exception (FE_INEXACT, checkable via fetestexcept(3))  when
       the result differs in value from the argument.

RETURN VALUE
       These functions return the rounded integer value.

       If x is integral, +0, -0, NaN, or infinite, x itself is returned.

ERRORS
       No  errors  occur.  POSIX.1-2001 documents a range error for overflows,
       but see NOTES.

NOTES
       SUSv2 and POSIX.1-2001 contain text about overflow (which might set er‐
       rno  to  ERANGE,  or raise an FE_OVERFLOW exception).  In practice, the
       result cannot overflow on any current machine, so  this  error-handling
       stuff is just nonsense.  (More precisely, overflow can happen only when
       the maximum value of the exponent is smaller than the number of mantis‐
       sa  bits.   For  the IEEE-754 standard 32-bit and 64-bit floating-point
       numbers the maximum value of the exponent is 127 (respectively,  1023),
       and  the  number of mantissa bits including the implicit bit is 24 (re‐
       spectively, 53).)

       If you want to store the rounded value in an integer type, you probably
       want to use one of the functions described in lrint(3) instead.

PROLOG
       This  manual  page is part of the POSIX Programmer's Manual.  The Linux
       implementation of this interface may differ (consult the  corresponding
       Linux  manual page for details of Linux behavior), or the interface may
       not be implemented on Linux.

NAME
       rint, rintf, rintl — round-to-nearest integral value

SYNOPSIS
       #include <math.h>

       double rint(double x);
       float rintf(float x);
       long double rintl(long double x);

DESCRIPTION
       The functionality described on this reference page is aligned with  the
       ISO C  standard.  Any  conflict between the requirements described here
       and the ISO C standard is unintentional. This  volume  of  POSIX.1‐2017
       defers to the ISO C standard.

       These  functions shall return the integral value (represented as a dou‐
       ble) nearest x in the direction of the current rounding mode. The  cur‐
       rent rounding mode is implementation-defined.

       If  the  current  rounding  mode  rounds toward negative infinity, then
       rint() shall be equivalent to floor().  If the  current  rounding  mode
       rounds  toward  positive  infinity,  then rint() shall be equivalent to
       ceil().  If the current rounding mode rounds towards zero, then  rint()
       shall  be  equivalent  to trunc().  If the current rounding mode rounds
       towards nearest, then rint() differs from round() in that halfway cases
       are rounded to even rather than away from zero.

       These  functions differ from the nearbyint(), nearbyintf(), and nearby‐
       intl() functions only in that they may raise the inexact floating-point
       exception if the result differs in value from the argument.

       An  application  wishing to check for error situations should set errno
       to zero and  call  feclearexcept(FE_ALL_EXCEPT)  before  calling  these
       functions. On return, if errno is non-zero or fetestexcept(FE_INVALID |
       FE_DIVBYZERO | FE_OVERFLOW | FE_UNDERFLOW) is non-zero,  an  error  has
       occurred.

RETURN VALUE
       Upon  successful  completion,  these functions shall return the integer
       (represented as a double precision number) nearest x in  the  direction
       of  the  current rounding mode.  The result shall have the same sign as
       x.

       If x is NaN, a NaN shall be returned.

       If x is ±0 or ±Inf, x shall be returned.

ERRORS
       No errors are defined.

       The following sections are informative.

EXAMPLES
       None.

APPLICATION USAGE
       The integral value returned by these functions need not be  expressible
       as  an intmax_t.  The return value should be tested before assigning it
       to an integer type to avoid the undefined results of an  integer  over‐
       flow.

RATIONALE
       None.

FUTURE DIRECTIONS
       None.
