NAME
       flatpak-repair - Repair a flatpak installation

SYNOPSIS
       flatpak repair [OPTION...]

DESCRIPTION
       Repair a flatpak installation by pruning and reinstalling invalid objects. The repair command does all of the following:

       •   Scan all locally available refs, removing any that don't correspond to a deployed ref.

       •   Verify each commit they point to, removing any invalid objects and noting any missing objects.

       •   Remove any refs that had an invalid object, and any non-partial refs that had missing objects.

       •   Prune all objects not referenced by a ref, which gets rid of any possibly invalid non-scanned objects.

       •   Enumerate all deployed refs and re-install any that are not in the repo (or are partial for a non-subdir deploy).

       Note that flatpak repair has to be run with root privileges to operate on the system installation.

       An alternative command for repairing OSTree repositories is ostree fsck.

OPTIONS
       The following options are understood:

       -h, --help
           Show help options and exit.

       -u, --user
           Repair per-user installation.

       --system

       --installation=NAME

       --dry-run
           Only report inconsistencies, don't make any changes

       --reinstall-all
           Reinstall all refs, regardless of whether they were removed from the repo or not

       -v, --verbose
           Print debug information during command processing.

       --ostree-verbose
