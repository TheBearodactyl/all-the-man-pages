PCRE2_MATCH_DATA_CREATE(3) Library Functions Manual PCRE2_MATCH_DATA_CREATE(3)

NAME
       PCRE2 - Perl-compatible regular expressions (revised API)

SYNOPSIS

       #include <pcre2.h>

       pcre2_match_data *pcre2_match_data_create(uint32_t ovecsize,
         pcre2_general_context *gcontext);

DESCRIPTION

       This function creates a new match data block, which is used for holding
       the result of a match. The first argument specifies the number of pairs
       of  offsets that are required. These form the "output vector" (ovector)
       within the match data block, and  are  used  to  identify  the  matched
       string and any captured substrings when matching with pcre2_match(), or
       a number of  different  matches  at  the  same  point  when  used  with
       pcre2_dfa_match().  There is always one pair of offsets; if ovecsize is
       zero, it is treated as one.

       The second argument points to a general context, for custom memory man‚Äê
       agement,  or  is  NULL  for system memory management. The result of the
       function is NULL if the memory for the block could not be obtained.

       There is a complete description of the PCRE2 native API in the pcre2api
       page and a description of the POSIX API in the pcre2posix page.
