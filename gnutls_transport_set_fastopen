NAME
       gnutls_transport_set_fastopen - API function

SYNOPSIS
       #include <gnutls/socket.h>

       void gnutls_transport_set_fastopen(gnutls_session_t session, int fd, struct sockaddr * connect_addr, socklen_t connect_addrlen, unsigned int flags);

ARGUMENTS
       gnutls_session_t session
                   is a gnutls_session_t type.

       int fd      is the session's socket descriptor

       struct sockaddr * connect_addr
                   is the address we want to connect to

       socklen_t connect_addrlen
                   is the length of  connect_addr

       unsigned int flags
                   must be zero

DESCRIPTION
       Enables  TCP Fast Open (TFO) for the specified TLS client session.  That means that TCP connection establishment and the transmission of the first TLS client hello packet are combined. The peer's
       address must be  specified in  connect_addr and  connect_addrlen , and the socket specified by  fd should not be connected.

       TFO only works for TCP sockets of type AF_INET and AF_INET6.  If the OS doesn't support TCP fast open this function will result to gnutls using connect() transparently during the first write.

NOTE
       This function overrides all the transport callback functions.  If this is undesirable, TCP Fast Open must be implemented on the user callback functions without calling this function.  When  using
       this function, transport callbacks must not be set, and gnutls_transport_set_ptr() or gnutls_transport_set_int() must not be called.

       On GNU/Linux TFO has to be enabled at the system layer, that is in /proc/sys/net/ipv4/tcp_fastopen, bit 0 has to be set.

       This function has no effect on server sessions.
