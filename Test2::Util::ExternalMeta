Test2::Util::ExternalMeta(3perl)                                                     Perl Programmers Reference Guide                                                     Test2::Util::ExternalMeta(3perl)

NAME
       Test2::Util::ExternalMeta - Allow third party tools to safely attach meta-data to your instances.

DESCRIPTION
       This package lets you define a clear, and consistent way to allow third party tools to attach meta-data to your instances. If your object consumes this package, and imports its methods, then
       third party meta-data has a safe place to live.

SYNOPSIS
           package My::Object;
           use strict;
           use warnings;

           use Test2::Util::ExternalMeta qw/meta get_meta set_meta delete_meta/;

           ...

       Now to use it:

           my $inst = My::Object->new;

           $inst->set_meta(foo => 'bar');
           my $val = $inst->get_meta('foo');

WHERE IS THE DATA STORED?
       This package assumes your instances are blessed hashrefs, it will not work if that is not true. It will store all meta-data in the "_meta" key on your objects hash. If your object makes use of
       the "_meta" key in its underlying hash, then there is a conflict and you cannot use this package.

EXPORTS
       $val = $obj->meta($key)
       $val = $obj->meta($key, $default)
           This will get the value for a specified meta $key. Normally this will return "undef" when there is no value for the $key, however you can specify a $default value to set when no value is
           already set.

       $val = $obj->get_meta($key)
           This will get the value for a specified meta $key. This does not have the $default overhead that "meta()" does.

       $val = $obj->delete_meta($key)
           This will remove the value of a specified meta $key. The old $val will be returned.

       $obj->set_meta($key, $val)
           Set the value of a specified meta $key.

META-KEY RESTRICTIONS
       Meta keys must be defined, and must be true when used as a boolean. Keys may not be references. You are free to stringify a reference "$ref" for use as a key, but this package will not stringify
       it for you.
