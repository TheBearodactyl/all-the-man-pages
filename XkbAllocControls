NAME
       XkbAllocControls - Allocates an XkbControlsRec structure in the XkbDescRec

SYNOPSIS
       Status XkbAllocControls (XkbDescPtr xkb, unsigned int which);

ARGUMENTS
       xkb    Xkb description in which to allocate ctrls rec

       which  mask of components of ctrls to allocate

DESCRIPTION
       The  need to allocate an XkbControlsRec structure seldom arises; Xkb creates one when an application calls XkbGetControls or a related function. For those situations where there is not an XkbCon‐
       trolsRec structure allocated in the XkbDescRec, allocate one by calling XkbAllocControls.

       XkbAllocControls allocates the ctrls field of the xkb parameter, initializes all fields to zero, and returns Success. If the ctrls field is not NULL, XkbAllocControls simply returns  Success.  If
       xkb is NULL, XkbAllocControls reports a BadMatch error. If the ctrls field could not be allocated, it reports a BadAlloc error.

       The  which  mask  specifies  the individual fields of the ctrls structure to be allocated and can contain any of the valid masks defined in Table 1.  (SHOULD THIS COMMENT BE LEFT IN????)  Because
       none of the currently existing controls have any structures associated with them, which is currently of little practical value in this call.

       Table 1 shows the actual values for the individual mask bits used to select controls for modification and to enable and disable the control. Note that the same mask bit is used to specify general
       modifications  to the parameters used to configure the control (which), and to enable and disable the control (enabled_ctrls). The anomalies in the table (no "ok" in column) are for controls that
       have no configurable attributes; and for controls that are not boolean controls and therefore cannot be enabled or disabled.

RETURN VALUES
       SUCCESS        allocates the ctrls field of the xkb parameter, initializes all fields to zero

                    the ctrls field is not NULL

DIAGNOSTICS
       BadAlloc       Unable to allocate storage

       BadMatch       A compatible version of Xkb was not available in the server or an argument has correct type and range, but is otherwise invalid
