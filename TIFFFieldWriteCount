NAME
       TIFFFieldWriteCount - get number of values to be written to field

SYNOPSIS
          #include <tiffio.h>

       int TIFFFieldWriteCount(const TIFFField *fip)

DESCRIPTION
       TIFFFieldWriteCount()  returns  the  number of values to be written into the specified TIFF field; that is, the number of arguments that should be supplied to TIFFSetField(). For most field types
       this is a small positive integer, typically 1 or 2, but there are some special values:

       • TIFF_VARIABLE indicates that a variable number of values is possible; then, a uint16_t count argument and a pointer data argument must be supplied to TIFFSetField().

       • TIFF_VARIABLE2 is the same as TIFF_VARIABLE except that the count argument must have type uint32_t. (On most modern machines, this makes no practical difference, and the count argument can sim‐
         ply be an int in either case.)

       • TIFF_SPP indicates that the number of arguments must be equal to the image’s number of samples per pixel.

       fip is a field information pointer previously returned by TIFFFindField(), TIFFFieldWithTag(), or TIFFFieldWithName().

       For most field types, TIFFFieldWriteCount() returns the same value as TIFFFieldReadCount(), but there are some exceptions.

RETURN VALUES
       TIFFFieldWriteCount() returns an integer.
