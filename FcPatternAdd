NAME
       FcPatternAdd - Add a value to a pattern

SYNOPSIS
       #include <fontconfig/fontconfig.h>

       FcBool FcPatternAdd (FcPattern *p, const char *object, FcValue value, FcBool append);

DESCRIPTION
       Adds  a  single  value to the list of values associated with the property named `object.  If `append is FcTrue, the value is added at the end of any existing list, otherwise it is inserted at the
       beginning.  `value' is saved (with FcValueSave) when inserted into the pattern so that the library retains no reference to any application-supplied data structure.
