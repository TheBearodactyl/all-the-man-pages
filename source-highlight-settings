NAME
       Source-highlight-settings - utility that can be used to write a config‐
       uration file for GNU Source-highlight (and its library)

SYNOPSIS
       source-highlight-settings

DESCRIPTION
       Since version 3.0,  GNU  Source-highlight  includes  also  the  utility
       source-highlight-settings,   which   can   be  used  to  check  whether
       source-highlight will be able to find its  language  definition  files,
       and  other  configuration files, and in case, to store the correct set‐
       tings in a configuration file, in the user home directory.

       In  particular,  the  stored  configuration   file   will   be   called
       source-highlight.conf and will be stored in $HOME/.source-highlight/.

       For  the  moment,  this  file  only  stores  the  default value for the
       --data-dir option.
