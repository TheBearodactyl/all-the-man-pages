NAME
       XkbGetNamedIndicator - Look up the indicator map and other information for an indicator by name

SYNOPSIS
       Bool  XkbGetNamedDeviceIndicator  (Display  *dpy, unsigned int dev_spec, unsigned int led_class, unsigned int led_id, Atom name, int *ndx_rtrn, Bool *state_rtrn, XkbIndicatorMapPtr map_rtrn, Bool
              *real_rtrn);

       Bool XkbGetNamedIndicator (Display *dpy, Atom name, int *ndx_rtrn, Bool *state_rtrn, XkbIndicatorMapPtr map_rtrn, Bool *real_rtrn);

ARGUMENTS
       dpy    connection to the X server

       dev_spec
              keyboard device ID, or XkbUseCoreKbd

       led_class
              feedback class, or XkbDfltXIClass

       led_id feedback ID, or XkbDfltXIId

       name   name of the indicator to be retrieved

       ndx_rtrn
              backfilled with the index of the retrieved indicator

       state_rtrn
              backfilled with the current state of the retrieved indicator

       map_rtrn
              backfilled with the mapping for the retrieved indicator

       real_rtrn
              backfilled with True if the named indicator is real (physical)

DESCRIPTION
       Xkb also allows applications to refer to indicators by name. Use XkbGetNames to get the indicator names. Using names eliminates the need for hard-coding bitmask values for  particular  keyboards.
       For example, instead of using vendor-specific constants such as WSKBLed_ScrollLock mask on Digital workstations or XLED_SCROLL_LOCK on Sun workstations, you can instead use XkbGetNamedDeviceIndi‐
       cator to look up information on the indicator named "Scroll Lock."

       If the device specified by device_spec has an indicator named name, XkbGetNamedDeviceIndicator returns True and populates the rest of the parameters with information about the  indicator.  Other‐
       wise, XkbGetNamedDeviceIndicator returns False.

       The  ndx_rtrn  field returns the zero-based index of the named indicator. This index is the bit position to use in any function call that requires a mask of indicator bits, as well as the indica‐
       tor's index into the XkbIndicatorRec array of indicator maps.  state_rtrn returns the current state of the named indicator (True = on, False = off).  map_rtrn returns the indicator  map  for  the
       named indicator. In addition, if the indicator is mapped to a physical LED, the real_rtrn parameter is set to True.

       Each of the " _rtrn " arguments is optional; you can pass NULL for any unneeded " _rtrn " arguments.

       XkbGetNamedIndicator  is  a convenience function that calls XkbGetNamedDeviceIndicator with a device_spec of XkbUseCoreKbd, a led_class of XkbDfltXIClass, and a led_id of XkbDfltXIId.  It returns
       the return value from XkbGetNamedDeviceIndicator.

RETURN VALUES
       True           The XkbGetNamedIndicator and XkbGetNamedDeviceIndicator functions return True if the device specified by device_spec has an indicator named name.

       False          The XkbGetNamedIndicator and XkbGetNamedDeviceIndicator functions return False if the device specified by device_spec does not have an indicator named name.
