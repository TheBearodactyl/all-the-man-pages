NAME
     acl_dup — duplicate an ACL

LIBRARY
     Linux Access Control Lists library (libacl, -lacl).

SYNOPSIS
     #include <sys/types.h>
     #include <sys/acl.h>

     acl_t
     acl_dup(acl_t acl);

DESCRIPTION
     The acl_dup() function returns a pointer to a copy of the ACL pointed to by acl.

     This function may cause memory to be allocated.  The caller should free any releasable memory, when the new ACL is no longer required, by calling acl_free(3) with the (void*)acl_t returned by
     acl_dup() as an argument.

RETURN VALUE
     On success, this function returns a pointer to the working storage.  On error, a value of (acl_t)NULL is returned, and errno is set appropriately.

ERRORS
     If any of the following conditions occur, the acl_dup() function returns a value of (acl_t)NULL and sets errno to the corresponding value:

     [EINVAL]           The argument acl is not a valid pointer to an ACL.

     [ENOMEM]           The acl_t to be returned requires more memory than is allowed by the hardware or system-imposed memory management constraints.

STANDARDS
     IEEE Std 1003.1e draft 17 (“POSIX.1e”, abandoned)
