NAME
       CURLMOPT_CONTENT_LENGTH_PENALTY_SIZE - size threshold for pipelining penalty

SYNOPSIS
       #include <curl/curl.h>

       CURLMcode curl_multi_setopt(CURLM *handle, CURLMOPT_CONTENT_LENGTH_PENALTY_SIZE,
                                   long size);

DESCRIPTION
       No function since pipelining was removed in 7.62.0.

       Pass  a long with a size in bytes. If a transfer in a pipeline is currently processing a request with a Content-Length larger than this CURLMOPT_CONTENT_LENGTH_PENALTY_SIZE(3), that pipeline will
       then not be considered for additional requests, even if it is shorter than CURLMOPT_MAX_PIPELINE_LENGTH(3).

DEFAULT
       The default value is 0, which means that the size penalization is inactive.

PROTOCOLS
       HTTP(S)

EXAMPLE
       CURLM *m = curl_multi_init();
       long maxlength = 10000;
       curl_multi_setopt(m, CURLMOPT_CONTENT_LENGTH_PENALTY_SIZE, maxlength);

AVAILABILITY
       Added in 7.30.0

RETURN VALUE
       Returns CURLM_OK if the option is supported, and CURLM_UNKNOWN_OPTION if not.
