NAME
       wc - print newline, word, and byte counts for each file

SYNOPSIS
       wc [OPTION]... [FILE]...
       wc [OPTION]... --files0-from=F

DESCRIPTION
       Print newline, word, and byte counts for each FILE, and a total line if more than one FILE is specified.  A word is a non-zero-length sequence of printable characters delimited by white space.

       With no FILE, or when FILE is -, read standard input.

       The options below may be used to select which counts are printed, always in the following order: newline, word, character, byte, maximum line length.

       -c, --bytes
              print the byte counts

       -m, --chars
              print the character counts

       -l, --lines
              print the newline counts

       --files0-from=F
              read input from the files specified by NUL-terminated names in file F; If F is - then read names from standard input

       -L, --max-line-length
              print the maximum display width

       -w, --words
              print the word counts

       --total=WHEN
              when to print a line with total counts; WHEN can be: auto, always, only, never

       --help display this help and exit

       --version
              output version information and exit

PROLOG

NAME
       wc — word, line, and byte or character count

SYNOPSIS
       wc [-c|-m] [-lw] [file...]

DESCRIPTION
       The wc utility shall read one or more input files and, by default, write the number of <newline> characters, words, and bytes contained in each input file to the standard output.

       The utility also shall write a total count for all named files, if more than one input file is specified.

       The wc utility shall consider a word to be a non-zero-length string of characters delimited by white space.

OPTIONS
       The wc utility shall conform to the Base Definitions volume of POSIX.1‐2017, Section 12.2, Utility Syntax Guidelines.

       The following options shall be supported:

       -c        Write to the standard output the number of bytes in each input file.

       -l        Write to the standard output the number of <newline> characters in each input file.

       -m        Write to the standard output the number of characters in each input file.

       -w        Write to the standard output the number of words in each input file.

       When any option is specified, wc shall report only the information requested by the specified options.

OPERANDS
       The following operand shall be supported:

       file      A pathname of an input file. If no file operands are specified, the standard input shall be used.

STDIN
       The standard input shall be used if no file operands are specified, and shall be used if a file operand is '-' and the implementation treats the '-' as meaning  standard  input.   Otherwise,  the
       standard input shall not be used.  See the INPUT FILES section.

INPUT FILES
       The input files may be of any type.

ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
       The following environment variables shall affect the execution of wc:

       LANG      Provide  a default value for the internationalization variables that are unset or null. (See the Base Definitions volume of POSIX.1‐2017, Section 8.2, Internationalization Variables for
                 the precedence of internationalization variables used to determine the values of locale categories.)

       LC_ALL    If set to a non-empty string value, override the values of all the other internationalization variables.

       LC_CTYPE  Determine the locale for the interpretation of sequences of bytes of text data as characters (for example, single-byte as opposed to multi-byte characters in arguments and input  files)
                 and which characters are defined as white-space characters.

       LC_MESSAGES
                 Determine the locale that should be used to affect the format and contents of diagnostic messages written to standard error and informative messages written to standard output.

       NLSPATH   Determine the location of message catalogs for the processing of LC_MESSAGES.

ASYNCHRONOUS EVENTS
       Default.

STDOUT
       By default, the standard output shall contain an entry for each input file of the form:

           "%d %d %d %s\n", <newlines>, <words>, <bytes>, <file>

       If the -m option is specified, the number of characters shall replace the <bytes> field in this format.

       If any options are specified and the -l option is not specified, the number of <newline> characters shall not be written.

       If any options are specified and the -w option is not specified, the number of words shall not be written.

       If any options are specified and neither -c nor -m is specified, the number of bytes or characters shall not be written.

       If no input file operands are specified, no name shall be written and no <blank> characters preceding the pathname shall be written.

       If more than one input file operand is specified, an additional line shall be written, of the same format as the other lines, except that the word total (in the POSIX locale) shall be written in‐
       stead of a pathname and the total of each column shall be written as appropriate. Such an additional line, if any, is written at the end of the output.

STDERR
       The standard error shall be used only for diagnostic messages.

OUTPUT FILES
       None.

EXTENDED DESCRIPTION
       None.

EXIT STATUS
       The following exit values shall be returned:

        0    Successful completion.

       >0    An error occurred.

CONSEQUENCES OF ERRORS
       Default.

       The following sections are informative.

APPLICATION USAGE
       The -m option is not a switch, but an option at the same level as -c.  Thus, to produce the full default output with character counts instead of bytes, the command required is:

           wc -mlw

EXAMPLES
       None.

RATIONALE
       The output file format pseudo-printf() string differs from the System V version of wc:

           "%7d%7d%7d %s\n"

       which produces possibly ambiguous and unparsable results for very large files, as it assumes no number shall exceed six digits.

       Some historical implementations use only <space>, <tab>, and <newline> as word separators. The equivalent of the ISO C standard isspace() function is more appropriate.

       The -c option stands for ``character'' count, even though it counts bytes.  This stems from the sometimes erroneous historical view that bytes and characters are the same size.  Due  to  interna‐
       tional requirements, the -m option (reminiscent of ``multi-byte'') was added to obtain actual character counts.

       Early  proposals  only  specified  the  results  when  input files were text files. The current specification more closely matches historical practice. (Bytes, words, and <newline> characters are
       counted separately and the results are written when an end-of-file is detected.)

       Historical implementations of the wc utility only accepted one argument to specify the options -c, -l, and -w.  Some of them also had multiple occurrences of an  option  cause  the  corresponding
       count  to  be  written multiple times and had the order of specification of the options affect the order of the fields on output, but did not document either of these. Because common usage either
       specifies no options or only one option, and because none of this was documented, the changes required by this volume of POSIX.1‐2017 should not break many historical  applications  (and  do  not
       break any historical conforming applications).

FUTURE DIRECTIONS
       None.
