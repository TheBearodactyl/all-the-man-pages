NAME
       Test::Tester::Capture - Help testing test modules built with Test::Builder

DESCRIPTION
       This is a subclass of Test::Builder that overrides many of the methods so that they don't output anything. It also keeps track of its own set of test results so that you can use Test::Builder
       based modules to perform tests on other Test::Builder based modules.

AUTHOR
       Most of the code here was lifted straight from Test::Builder and then had chunks removed by Fergal Daly <fergal@esatclear.ie>.
