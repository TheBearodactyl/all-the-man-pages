NAME
       xcb_sync_await_fence -

SYNOPSIS
       #include <xcb/sync.h>

   Request function
       xcb_void_cookie_t xcb_sync_await_fence(xcb_connection_t *conn, uint32_t fence_list_len, const xcb_sync_fence_t *fence_list);

REQUEST ARGUMENTS
       conn      The XCB connection to X11.

       fence_list_len
                 TODO: NOT YET DOCUMENTED.

       fence_list
                 TODO: NOT YET DOCUMENTED.

DESCRIPTION
RETURN VALUE
       Returns an xcb_void_cookie_t. Errors (if any) have to be handled in the event loop.

       If you want to handle errors directly with xcb_request_check instead, use xcb_sync_await_fence_checked. See xcb-requests(3) for details.
