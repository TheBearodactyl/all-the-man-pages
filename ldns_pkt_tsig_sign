NAME
       ldns_pkt_tsig_verify, ldns_pkt_tsig_sign - tsig signing and verification

SYNOPSIS
       #include <stdint.h>
       #include <stdbool.h>

       #include <ldns/ldns.h>

       bool ldns_pkt_tsig_verify(ldns_pkt *pkt, const uint8_t *wire, size_t wire_size, const char *key_name, const char *key_data, const ldns_rdf *mac);

       ldns_status ldns_pkt_tsig_sign(ldns_pkt *pkt, const char *key_name, const char *key_data, uint16_t fudge, const char *algorithm_name, const ldns_rdf *query_mac);

DESCRIPTION
       ldns_pkt_tsig_verify() verifies the tsig rr for the given packet and key.  The wire must be given too because tsig does not sign normalized packets.
              pkt: the packet to verify
              wire: needed to verify the mac
              wire_size: size of wire
              key_name: the name of the shared key
              key_data: the key in base 64 format
              mac: original mac
              Returns true if tsig is correct, false if not, or if tsig is not set

       ldns_pkt_tsig_sign() creates a tsig rr for the given packet and key.
              pkt: the packet to sign
              key_name: the name of the shared key
              key_data: the key in base 64 format
              fudge: seconds of error permitted in time signed
              algorithm_name: the name of the algorithm used
              query_mac: is added to the digest if not NULL (so NULL is for signing queries, not NULL is for signing answers)
              Returns status (OK if success)
