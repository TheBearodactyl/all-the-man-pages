ARES_INIT(3)                                                                             Library Functions Manual                                                                             ARES_INIT(3)

NAME
       ares_init - Initialize a resolver channel

SYNOPSIS
       #include <ares.h>

       int ares_init(ares_channel *channelptr)

DESCRIPTION
       The  ares_init(3) function initializes a communications channel for name service lookups.  If it returns successfully, ares_init(3) will set the variable pointed to by channelptr to a handle used
       to identify the name service channel.  The caller should invoke ares_destroy(3) on the handle when the channel is no longer needed.

       The ares_init_options(3) function is provide to offer more init alternatives.

RETURN VALUES
       ares_init(3) can return any of the following values:

       ARES_SUCCESS  Initialization succeeded.

       ARES_EFILE    A configuration file could not be read.

       ARES_ENOMEM   The process's available memory was exhausted.

       ARES_ENOTINITIALIZED
                     c-ares library initialization not yet performed.

NOTES
       When initializing from /etc/resolv.conf, ares_init(3) reads the domain and search directives to allow lookups of short names relative to the domains specified. The domain  and  search  directives
       override one another. If more that one instance of either domain or search directives is specified, the last occurrence wins. For more information, please see the resolv.conf(5) manual page.
