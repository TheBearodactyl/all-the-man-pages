NAME
       gnutls_set_default_priority_append - API function

SYNOPSIS
       #include <gnutls/gnutls.h>

       int gnutls_set_default_priority_append(gnutls_session_t session, const char * add_prio, const char ** err_pos, unsigned flags);

ARGUMENTS
       gnutls_session_t session
                   is a gnutls_session_t type.

       const char * add_prio
                   is a string describing priorities to be appended to default

       const char ** err_pos
                   In case of an error this will have the position in the string the error occurred

       unsigned flags
                   must be zero

DESCRIPTION
       Sets the default priority on the ciphers, key exchange methods, and macs with the additional options in  add_prio . This is the recommended method of setting the defaults when only few additional
       options are to be added. This promotes consistency between applications using GnuTLS, and allows GnuTLS using applications to update settings in par with the library.

       The  add_prio string should start as a normal priority string, e.g., with ':'.

       To allow a user to override the defaults (e.g., when a user interface or configuration file is available), the functions gnutls_priority_set_direct() or gnutls_priority_set() can be used.

RETURNS
       GNUTLS_E_SUCCESS on success, or an error code.

SINCE
       3.6.3
