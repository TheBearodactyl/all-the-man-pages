NAME
       gnutls_ext_get_current_msg - API function

SYNOPSIS
       #include <gnutls/gnutls.h>

       unsigned gnutls_ext_get_current_msg(gnutls_session_t session);

ARGUMENTS
       gnutls_session_t session
                   a gnutls_session_t opaque pointer

DESCRIPTION
       This function allows an extension handler to obtain the message this extension is being called from. The returned value is a single entry of the gnutls_ext_flags_t enumeration. That is, if an ex‐
       tension was registered with the GNUTLS_EXT_FLAG_HRR and GNUTLS_EXT_FLAG_EE flags, the value when called during parsing of the encrypted extensions message will be GNUTLS_EXT_FLAG_EE.

       If not called under an extension handler, its value is undefined.

SINCE
       3.6.3
