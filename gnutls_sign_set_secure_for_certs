NAME
       gnutls_sign_set_secure_for_certs - API function

SYNOPSIS
       #include <gnutls/gnutls.h>

       int gnutls_sign_set_secure_for_certs(gnutls_sign_algorithm_t sign, unsigned int secure);

ARGUMENTS
       gnutls_sign_algorithm_t sign
                   the sign algorithm

       unsigned int secure
                   whether to mark the sign algorithm secure for certificates

DESCRIPTION
       Modify  the  previous system wide setting that marked  sign as secure or insecure for the use in certificates.  Calling this function is allowed only if allowlisting mode is set in the configura‐
       tion file, and only if the system-wide TLS priority string has not been initialized yet.  The intended usage is to provide applications with a way to expressly deviate from  the  distribution  or
       site defaults inherited from the configuration file.  The modification is composable with further modifications performed through the priority string mechanism.

       This  function  is  not  thread-safe and is intended to be called in the main thread at the beginning of the process execution.  When  secure is true,  sign is marked as secure for any use unlike
       gnutls_sign_set_secure().  Otherwise, it is marked as insecure only for the use in certificates.  Use gnutls_sign_set_secure() to mark it insecure for any uses.

RETURNS
       0 on success or negative error code otherwise.

SINCE
       3.7.3
