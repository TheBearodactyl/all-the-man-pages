NAME
       xcb_poly_fill_rectangle - Fills rectangles

SYNOPSIS
       #include <xcb/xproto.h>

   Request function
       xcb_void_cookie_t xcb_poly_fill_rectangle(xcb_connection_t *conn, xcb_drawable_t drawable, xcb_gcontext_t gc, uint32_t rectangles_len, const xcb_rectangle_t *rectangles);

REQUEST ARGUMENTS
       conn      The XCB connection to X11.

       drawable  The drawable (Window or Pixmap) to draw on.

       gc        The graphics context to use.

                 The following graphics context components are used: function, plane-mask, fill-style, subwindow-mode, clip-x-origin, clip-y-origin, and clip-mask.

                 The following graphics context mode-dependent components are used: foreground, background, tile, stipple, tile-stipple-x-origin, and tile-stipple-y-origin.

       rectangles_len
                 The number of xcb_rectangle_t structures in rectangles.

       rectangles
                 The rectangles to fill.

DESCRIPTION
       Fills the specified rectangle(s) in the order listed in the array. For any given rectangle, each pixel is not drawn more than once. If rectangles intersect, the intersecting pixels are drawn mul‚Äê
       tiple times.

RETURN VALUE
       Returns an xcb_void_cookie_t. Errors (if any) have to be handled in the event loop.

       If you want to handle errors directly with xcb_request_check instead, use xcb_poly_fill_rectangle_checked. See xcb-requests(3) for details.

ERRORS
       xcb_drawable_error_t
                 The specified drawable (Window or Pixmap) does not exist.

       xcb_g_context_error_t
                 The specified graphics context does not exist.

       xcb_match_error_t
                 TODO: reasons?
