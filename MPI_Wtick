NAME
       MPI_Wtick - Returns the resolution of MPI_Wtime.

SYNTAX
C Syntax
       #include <mpi.h>
       double MPI_Wtick()

Fortran Syntax
       USE MPI
       ! or the older form: INCLUDE 'mpif.h'
       DOUBLE PRECISION MPI_WTICK()

Fortran 2008 Syntax
       USE mpi_f08
       DOUBLE PRECISION MPI_WTICK()

C++ Syntax
       #include <mpi.h>
       double MPI::Wtick()

RETURN VALUE
       Time in seconds of resolution of MPI_Wtime.

DESCRIPTION
       MPI_Wtick  returns the resolution of MPI_Wtime in seconds. That is, it returns, as a double-precision value, the number of seconds between successive clock ticks. For example, if the clock is im‚Äê
       plemented by the hardware as a counter that is incremented every millisecond, the value returned by MPI_Wtick should be 10^-3.

NOTE
       This function does not return an error value. Consequently, the result of calling it before MPI_Init or after MPI_Finalize is undefined.
