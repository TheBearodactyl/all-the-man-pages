NAME
       CURLOPT_TCP_NODELAY - the TCP_NODELAY option

SYNOPSIS
       #include <curl/curl.h>

       CURLcode curl_easy_setopt(CURL *handle, CURLOPT_TCP_NODELAY, long nodelay);

DESCRIPTION
       Pass  a  long  specifying whether the TCP_NODELAY option is to be set or cleared (1L = set, 0 = clear). The option is set by default. This will have no effect after the connection has been estab‐
       lished.

       Setting this option to 1L will disable TCP's Nagle algorithm on this connection. The purpose of this algorithm is to try to minimize the number of small packets on the network (where "small pack‐
       ets" means TCP segments less than the Maximum Segment Size for the network).

       Maximizing the amount of data sent per TCP segment is good because it amortizes the overhead of the send. However, in some cases small segments may need to be sent without delay. This is less ef‐
       ficient than sending larger amounts of data at a time, and can contribute to congestion on the network if overdone.

DEFAULT
       1

PROTOCOLS
       All

EXAMPLE
       CURL *curl = curl_easy_init();
       if(curl) {
         curl_easy_setopt(curl, CURLOPT_URL, "https://example.com");
         /* leave Nagle enabled */
         curl_easy_setopt(curl, CURLOPT_TCP_NODELAY, 0);
         curl_easy_perform(curl);
       }

AVAILABILITY
       Always. The default was changed to 1 from 0 in 7.50.2.

RETURN VALUE
       Returns CURLE_OK
