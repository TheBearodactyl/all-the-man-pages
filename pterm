NAME
       pterm ‐ yet another X terminal emulator

SYNOPSIS
       pterm [ options ]

DESCRIPTION
       pterm is a terminal emulator for X. It is based on a port of the termi‐
       nal emulation engine in the Windows SSH client PuTTY.

OPTIONS
       The command-line options supported by pterm are:

       -e command [ arguments ]
              Specify a command to be executed in the new terminal. Everything
              on the command line after this option will be passed straight to
              the execvp system call; so if you need the command  to  redirect
              its input or output, you will have to use sh:

              pterm -e sh -c 'mycommand < inputfile'

       --display display-name
              Specify  the X display on which to open pterm. (Note this option
              has a double minus sign, even though none of the others do. This
              is because this option is supplied automatically by GTK. Sorry.)

       -name name
              Specify  the  name  under which pterm looks up X resources. Nor‐
              mally it will look them up as (for example) pterm.Font.  If  you
              specify  `-name  xyz', it will look them up as xyz.Font instead.
              This allows you to set up several different sets of defaults and
              choose between them.

       -fn font-name
              Specify  the font to use for normal text displayed in the termi‐
              nal. For example, -fn fixed, -fn "Monospace 12".

       -fb font-name
              Specify the font to use for bold text displayed in the terminal.
              If  the  BoldAsColour  resource  is set to 1 (the default), bold
              text will be displayed in different colours instead of a differ‐
              ent font, so this option will be ignored. If BoldAsColour is set
              to 0 or 2 and you do not specify a bold font, pterm  will  over‐
              print the normal font to make it look bolder.

       -fw font-name
              Specify  the  font to use for double-width characters (typically
              Chinese, Japanese and Korean text) displayed in the terminal.

       -fwb font-name
              Specify the font to use for bold double-width characters  (typi‐
              cally Chinese, Japanese and Korean text). Like -fb, this will be
              ignored unless the BoldAsColour resource is set to 0 or 2.

       -geometry geometry
              Specify the size of the terminal, in rows and columns  of  text.
              See X(7) for more information on the syntax of geometry specifi‐
              cations.

       -sl lines
              Specify the number of lines of scrollback to save off the top of
              the terminal.

       -fg colour
              Specify the foreground colour to use for normal text.

       -bg colour
              Specify the background colour to use for normal text.

       -bfg colour
              Specify  the  foreground  colour  to  use  for bold text, if the
              BoldAsColour resource is set to 1 (the default) or 2.

       -bbg colour
              Specify the foreground colour  to  use  for  bold  reverse-video
              text,  if the BoldAsColour resource is set to 1 (the default) or
              2. (This colour is best thought of as the bold  version  of  the
              background  colour; so it only appears when text is displayed in
              the background colour.)

       -cfg colour
              Specify the foreground colour to use for  text  covered  by  the
              cursor.

       -cbg colour
              Specify  the  background  colour  to use for text covered by the
              cursor. In other words, this is the main colour of the cursor.

       -title title
              Specify the initial title of the terminal window. (This  can  be
              changed under control of the server.)

       -ut- or +ut
              Tells pterm not to record your login in the utmp, wtmp and last‐
              log system log files; so you will not show up on finger  or  who
              listings, for example.

       -ut    Tells pterm to record your login in utmp, wtmp and lastlog: this
              is the opposite of -ut-. This is the default  option:  you  will
              probably  only need to specify it explicitly if you have changed
              the default using the StampUtmp resource.

       -ls- or +ls
              Tells pterm not to execute your shell as a login shell.

       -ls    Tells pterm to execute your shell as a login shell: this is  the
              opposite  of -ls-. This is the default option: you will probably
              only need to specify it explicitly if you have changed  the  de‐
              fault using the LoginShell resource.

       -sb- or +sb
              Tells pterm not to display a scroll bar.

       -sb    Tells  pterm  to  display  a scroll bar: this is the opposite of
              -sb-. This is the default option: you will probably only need to
              specify  it explicitly if you have changed the default using the
              ScrollBar resource.

       -log logfile, -sessionlog logfile
              This option makes pterm log all the terminal output to a file as
              well as displaying it in the terminal.

       -cs charset
              This  option  specifies  the character set in which pterm should
              assume the session is operating. This character set will be used
              to interpret all the data received from the session, and all in‐
              put you type or paste into pterm will  be  converted  into  this
              character set before being sent to the session.

              Any character set name which is valid in a MIME header (and sup‐
              ported  by  pterm)  should   be   valid   here   (examples   are
              `ISO-8859-1',  `windows-1252'  or  `UTF-8'). Also, any character
              encoding which is valid in an X logical font description  should
              be valid (`ibm-cp437', for example).

              pterm's  default behaviour is to use the same character encoding
              as its primary font. If you supply a Unicode (iso10646-1)  font,
              it will default to the UTF-8 character set.

              Character set names are case-insensitive.

       -nethack
              Tells  pterm to enable NetHack keypad mode, in which the numeric
              keypad generates the NetHack hjklyubn direction keys.  This  en‐
              ables you to play NetHack with the numeric keypad without having
              to use the NetHack number_pad  option  (which  requires  you  to
              press `n' before any repeat count). So you can move with the nu‐
              meric keypad, and enter repeat counts  with  the  normal  number
              keys.

       -xrm resource-string
              This  option  specifies an X resource string. Useful for setting
              resources which do not have their own command-line options.  For
              example:

              pterm -xrm 'ScrollbarOnLeft: 1'

       -help, --help
              Display a message summarizing the available options.

       -pgpfp Display the fingerprints of the PuTTY PGP Master Keys, to aid in
              verifying new files released by the PuTTY team.

X RESOURCES
       pterm can be more completely configured by means of X resources. All of
       these  resources  are  of the form pterm.FOO for some FOO; you can make
       pterm look them up under another name, such as xyz.FOO,  by  specifying
       the command-line option `-name xyz'.

       pterm.CloseOnExit
              This  option  should  be  set to 0, 1 or 2; the default is 2. It
              controls what pterm does when the process running inside it ter‐
              minates.  When set to 2 (the default), pterm will close its win‐
              dow as soon as the process inside it terminates. When set to  0,
              pterm  will print the process's exit status, and the window will
              remain present until a key is pressed (allowing you  to  inspect
              the scrollback, and copy and paste text out of it).

              When  this  setting is set to 1, pterm will close immediately if
              the process exits cleanly (with an exit status of zero), but the
              window  will  stay  around  if the process exits with a non-zero
              code or on a signal. This enables you to see what went wrong  if
              the  process suffers an error, but not to have to bother closing
              the window in normal circumstances.

       pterm.WarnOnClose
              This option should be set to either 0 or 1; the  default  is  1.
              When  set  to  1, pterm will ask for confirmation before closing
              its window when you press the close button.

       pterm.TerminalType
              This controls the value set in the TERM environment variable in‐
              side the new terminal. The default is `xterm'.

       pterm.BackspaceIsDelete
              This  option  should  be set to either 0 or 1; the default is 1.
              When  set  to  0,  the  ordinary  Backspace  key  generates  the
              Backspace character (^H); when set to 1, it generates the Delete
              character (^?). Whichever one you set, the terminal  device  in‐
              side pterm will be set up to expect it.

       pterm.RXVTHomeEnd
              This  option  should  be set to either 0 or 1; the default is 0.
              When it is set to 1, the Home and End keys generate the  control
              sequences they would generate in the rxvt terminal emulator, in‐
              stead of the more usual ones generated by other emulators.

       pterm.LinuxFunctionKeys
              This option can be set to any number between 0 and 5  inclusive;
              the  default  is 0. The modes vary the control sequences sent by
              the function keys; for more complete documentation, it is proba‐
              bly simplest to try each option in `pterm -e cat', and press the
              keys to see what they generate.

       pterm.NoApplicationKeys
              This option should be set to either 0 or 1; the  default  is  0.
              When  set  to 1, it stops the server from ever switching the nu‐
              meric keypad into application mode (where the  keys  send  func‐
              tion-key-like  sequences  instead of numbers or arrow keys). You
              probably only need this if some application is making a nuisance
              of itself.

       pterm.NoApplicationCursors
              This  option  should  be set to either 0 or 1; the default is 0.
              When set to 1, it stops the server from ever switching the  cur‐
              sor  keys  into  application  mode (where the keys send slightly
              different sequences). You probably only need this if some appli‐
              cation is making a nuisance of itself.

       pterm.NoMouseReporting
              This  option  should  be set to either 0 or 1; the default is 0.
              When set to 1, it stops the server from ever enabling mouse  re‐
              porting mode (where mouse clicks are sent to the application in‐
              stead of controlling cut and paste).

       pterm.NoRemoteResize
              This option should be set to either 0 or 1; the  default  is  0.
              When  set  to 1, it stops the server from being able to remotely
              control the size of the pterm window.

       pterm.NoAltScreen
              This option should be set to either 0 or 1; the  default  is  0.
              When  set  to  1,  it stops the server from using the `alternate
              screen' terminal feature, which  lets  full-screen  applications
              leave the screen exactly the way they found it.

       pterm.NoRemoteWinTitle
              This  option  should  be set to either 0 or 1; the default is 0.
              When set to 1, it stops the server from remotely controlling the
              title of the pterm window.

       pterm.NoRemoteQTitle
              This  option  should  be set to either 0 or 1; the default is 1.
              When set to 1, it stops the server from remotely requesting  the
              title of the pterm window.

              This  feature is a POTENTIAL SECURITY HAZARD. If a malicious ap‐
              plication can write data to your terminal (for example,  if  you
              merely  cat a file owned by someone else on the server machine),
              it can change your window title (unless you have  disabled  this
              using  the  NoRemoteWinTitle resource) and then use this service
              to have the new window title sent back to the server as if typed
              at  the keyboard. This allows an attacker to fake keypresses and
              potentially cause your server-side applications to do things you
              didn't  want. Therefore this feature is disabled by default, and
              we recommend you do not turn it on unless you really  know  what
              you are doing.

       pterm.NoDBackspace
              This  option  should  be set to either 0 or 1; the default is 0.
              When set to 1, it disables the normal action of the Delete  (^?)
              character when sent from the server to the terminal, which is to
              move the cursor left by one space and erase  the  character  now
              under it.

       pterm.ApplicationCursorKeys
              This  option  should  be set to either 0 or 1; the default is 0.
              When set to 1, the default initial state of the cursor keys  are
              application  mode  (where  the  keys  send function-key-like se‐
              quences instead of numbers or arrow keys). When set  to  0,  the
              default state is the normal one.

       pterm.ApplicationKeypad
              This  option  should  be set to either 0 or 1; the default is 0.
              When set to 1, the default initial state of the  numeric  keypad
              is  application  mode (where the keys send function-key-like se‐
              quences instead of numbers or arrow keys). When set  to  0,  the
              default state is the normal one.

       pterm.NetHackKeypad
              This  option  should  be set to either 0 or 1; the default is 0.
              When set to 1, the numeric keypad operates in NetHack mode. This
              is equivalent to the -nethack command-line option.

       pterm.Answerback
              This  option controls the string which the terminal sends in re‐
              sponse to receiving the ^E character (`tell me about yourself').
              By default this string is `PuTTY'.

       pterm.HideMousePtr
              This  option  should  be set to either 0 or 1; the default is 0.
              When it is set to 1, the mouse pointer will disappear if  it  is
              over  the  pterm window and you press a key. It will reappear as
              soon as you move it.

       pterm.WindowBorder
              This option controls the number of pixels of space  between  the
              text in the pterm window and the window frame. The default is 1.
              You can increase this value, but decreasing it to 0 is not  rec‐
              ommended because it can cause the window manager's size hints to
              work incorrectly.

       pterm.CurType
              This option should be set to either 0, 1 or 2; the default is 0.
              When set to 0, the text cursor displayed in the window is a rec‐
              tangular block. When set to 1, the cursor is an underline;  when
              set to 2, it is a vertical line.

       pterm.BlinkCur
              This  option  should  be set to either 0 or 1; the default is 0.
              When it is set to 1, the text cursor will blink when the  window
              is active.

       pterm.Beep
              This option should be set to either 0 or 2 (yes, 2); the default
              is 0. When it is set to 2, pterm will respond to a bell  charac‐
              ter (^G) by flashing the window instead of beeping.

       pterm.BellOverload
              This  option  should  be set to either 0 or 1; the default is 0.
              When it is set to 1, pterm will watch out for large  numbers  of
              bells  arriving in a short time and will temporarily disable the
              bell until they stop. The idea is that if you cat a binary file,
              the  frantic beeping will mostly be silenced by this feature and
              will not drive you crazy.

              The bell overload mode is activated by receiving N bells in time
              T;  after a further time S without any bells, overload mode will
              turn itself off again.

              Bell overload mode is always deactivated by any keypress in  the
              terminal.  This means it can respond to large unexpected streams
              of data, but does not interfere with ordinary  command-line  ac‐
              tivities that generate beeps (such as filename completion).

       pterm.BellOverloadN
              This  option counts the number of bell characters which will ac‐
              tivate bell overload if they are received  within  a  length  of
              time T. The default is 5.

       pterm.BellOverloadT
              This  option  specifies  the time period in which receiving N or
              more bells will activate bell overload mode. It is  measured  in
              microseconds, so (for example) set it to 1000000 for one second.
              The default is 2000000 (two seconds).

       pterm.BellOverloadS
              This option specifies the time period  of  silence  required  to
              turn  off bell overload mode. It is measured in microseconds, so
              (for example) set it to 1000000 for one second. The  default  is
              5000000 (five seconds of silence).

       pterm.ScrollbackLines
              This option specifies how many lines of scrollback to save above
              the visible terminal screen. The default is 200.  This  resource
              is equivalent to the -sl command-line option.

       pterm.DECOriginMode
              This option should be set to either 0 or 1; the default is 0. It
              specifies the default state of DEC Origin Mode.  (If  you  don't
              know what that means, you probably don't need to mess with it.)

       pterm.AutoWrapMode
              This option should be set to either 0 or 1; the default is 1. It
              specifies the default state of auto wrap mode. When  set  to  1,
              very long lines will wrap over to the next line on the terminal;
              when set to 0, long lines will be squashed  against  the  right-
              hand edge of the screen.

       pterm.LFImpliesCR
              This  option  should  be set to either 0 or 1; the default is 0.
              When set to 1, the terminal will return the cursor to  the  left
              side of the screen when it receives a line feed character.

       pterm.WinTitle
              This resource is the same as the -T command-line option: it con‐
              trols the initial title of the window. The default is `pterm'.

       pterm.TermWidth
              This resource is the same as the width  part  of  the  -geometry
              command-line  option:  it controls the number of columns of text
              in the window. The default is 80.

       pterm.TermHeight
              This resource is the same as the width  part  of  the  -geometry
              command-line  option:  it controls the number of columns of text
              in the window. The defaults is 24.

       pterm.Font
              This resource is the same as the  -fn  command-line  option:  it
              controls  the  font  used to display normal text. The default is
              `fixed'.

       pterm.BoldFont
              This resource is the same as the  -fb  command-line  option:  it
              controls the font used to display bold text when BoldAsColour is
              set to 0 or 2. The default is unset (the font will be bolded  by
              printing it twice at a one-pixel offset).

       pterm.WideFont
              This  resource  is  the  same as the -fw command-line option: it
              controls the font used to display double-width  characters.  The
              default is unset (double-width characters cannot be displayed).

       pterm.WideBoldFont
              This  resource  is  the same as the -fwb command-line option: it
              controls the font used to  display  double-width  characters  in
              bold,  when  BoldAsColour is set to 0 or 2. The default is unset
              (double-width characters are displayed in bold by printing  them
              twice at a one-pixel offset).

       pterm.ShadowBoldOffset
              This  resource  can  be set to an integer; the default is ‐1. It
              specifies the offset at which text  is  overprinted  when  using
              `shadow  bold' mode. The default (1) means that the text will be
              printed in the normal place,  and  also  one  character  to  the
              right;  this  seems  to work well for most X bitmap fonts, which
              have a blank line of pixels down the right-hand side.  For  some
              fonts, you may need to set this to ‐1, so that the text is over‐
              printed one pixel to the left; for really large fonts,  you  may
              want to set it higher than 1 (in one direction or the other).

       pterm.BoldAsColour
              This  option  should be set to either 0, 1, or 2; the default is
              1. It specifies how bold text should be displayed. When  set  to
              1,  bold  text  is  shown by displaying it in a brighter colour;
              when set to 0, bold text is shown by displaying it in a  heavier
              font;  when  set to 2, both effects happen at once (a heavy font
              and a brighter colour).

       pterm.Colour0, pterm.Colour1, ..., pterm.Colour21
              These options control the various colours used to  display  text
              in the pterm window. Each one should be specified as a triple of
              decimal numbers giving red, green and blue values: so that black
              is `0,0,0', white is `255,255,255', red is `255,0,0' and so on.

              Colours  0  and  1  specify  the  foreground colour and its bold
              equivalent (the -fg and -bfg command-line  options).  Colours  2
              and 3 specify the background colour and its bold equivalent (the
              -bg and -bbg command-line options). Colours 4 and 5 specify  the
              text  and  block  colours used for the cursor (the -cfg and -cbg
              command-line options). Each even number from 6 to  20  inclusive
              specifies  the  colour  to  be  used for one of the ANSI primary
              colour specifications (black, red, green, yellow, blue, magenta,
              cyan, white, in that order); the odd numbers from 7 to 21 inclu‐
              sive specify the bold version of each colour, in the same order.
              The defaults are:

              pterm.Colour0: 187,187,187
              pterm.Colour1: 255,255,255
              pterm.Colour2: 0,0,0
              pterm.Colour3: 85,85,85
              pterm.Colour4: 0,0,0
              pterm.Colour5: 0,255,0
              pterm.Colour6: 0,0,0
              pterm.Colour7: 85,85,85
              pterm.Colour8: 187,0,0
              pterm.Colour9: 255,85,85
              pterm.Colour10: 0,187,0
              pterm.Colour11: 85,255,85
              pterm.Colour12: 187,187,0
              pterm.Colour13: 255,255,85
              pterm.Colour14: 0,0,187
              pterm.Colour15: 85,85,255
              pterm.Colour16: 187,0,187
              pterm.Colour17: 255,85,255
              pterm.Colour18: 0,187,187
              pterm.Colour19: 85,255,255
              pterm.Colour20: 187,187,187
              pterm.Colour21: 255,255,255

       pterm.RectSelect
              This  option  should  be set to either 0 or 1; the default is 0.
              When set to 0, dragging the mouse over several lines selects  to
              the  end  of  each line and from the beginning of the next; when
              set to 1, dragging the mouse over several lines selects  a  rec‐
              tangular  region.  In each case, holding down Alt while dragging
              gives the other behaviour.

       pterm.MouseOverride
              This option should be set to either 0 or 1; the  default  is  1.
              When  set  to  1, if the application requests mouse tracking (so
              that mouse clicks are sent to it instead  of  doing  selection),
              holding  down  Shift  will revert the mouse to normal selection.
              When set to 0, mouse tracking completely disables selection.

       pterm.Printer
              This option is unset by default. If you set it, then server-con‐
              trolled  printing  is  enabled:  the server can send control se‐
              quences to request data to be sent to a printer. That data  will
              be piped into the command you specify here; so you might want to
              set it to `lpr', for example, or `lpr -Pmyprinter'.

       pterm.ScrollBar
              This option should be set to either 0 or 1; the  default  is  1.
              When  set  to  0, the scrollbar is hidden (although Shift-PageUp
              and Shift-PageDown still work). This is the same as the -sb com‐
              mand-line option.

       pterm.ScrollbarOnLeft
              This  option  should  be set to either 0 or 1; the default is 0.
              When set to 1, the scrollbar will be displayed on  the  left  of
              the terminal instead of on the right.

       pterm.ScrollOnKey
              This  option  should  be set to either 0 or 1; the default is 0.
              When set to 1, any keypress causes the position of  the  scroll‐
              back to be reset to the very bottom.

       pterm.ScrollOnDisp
              This  option  should  be set to either 0 or 1; the default is 1.
              When set to 1, any activity in the display causes  the  position
              of the scrollback to be reset to the very bottom.

       pterm.LineCodePage
              This  option specifies the character set to be used for the ses‐
              sion. This is the same as the -cs command-line option.

       pterm.NoRemoteCharset
              This option disables the terminal's ability to change its  char‐
              acter  set  when it receives escape sequences telling it to. You
              might need to do this to interoperate with programs which incor‐
              rectly  change the character set to something they think is sen‐
              sible.

       pterm.BCE
              This option should be set to either 0 or 1; the  default  is  1.
              When set to 1, the various control sequences that erase parts of
              the terminal display will erase in whatever  the  current  back‐
              ground  colour  is;  when set to 0, they will erase in black al‐
              ways.

       pterm.BlinkText
              This option should be set to either 0 or 1; the  default  is  0.
              When set to 1, text specified as blinking by the server will ac‐
              tually blink on and off; when set to 0, pterm will use the  less
              distracting  approach  of  making  the  text's background colour
              bold.

       pterm.StampUtmp
              This option should be set to either 0 or 1; the  default  is  1.
              When  set  to  1, pterm will log the login in the various system
              log files. This resource is equivalent to the  -ut  command-line
              option.

       pterm.LoginShell
              This  option  should  be set to either 0 or 1; the default is 1.
              When set to 1, pterm will execute your shell as a  login  shell.
              This resource is equivalent to the -ls command-line option.

BUGS
       Most  of  the  X  resources  have silly names. (Historical reasons from
       PuTTY, mostly.)
