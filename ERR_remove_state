NAME
       ERR_remove_thread_state, ERR_remove_state - DEPRECATED

SYNOPSIS
       The following function has been deprecated since OpenSSL 1.0.0, and can be hidden entirely by defining OPENSSL_API_COMPAT with a suitable version value, see openssl_user_macros(7):

        void ERR_remove_state(unsigned long tid);

       The following function has been deprecated since OpenSSL 1.1.0, and can be hidden entirely by defining OPENSSL_API_COMPAT with a suitable version value, see openssl_user_macros(7):

        void ERR_remove_thread_state(void *tid);

DESCRIPTION
       ERR_remove_state() frees the error queue associated with the specified thread, identified by tid.  ERR_remove_thread_state() does the same thing, except the identifier is an opaque pointer.

RETURN VALUES
       ERR_remove_state() and ERR_remove_thread_state() return no value.

SEE ALSO
       LOPENSSL_init_crypto(3)

HISTORY
