NAME
       gnutls_est_record_overhead_size - API function

SYNOPSIS
       #include <gnutls/gnutls.h>

       size_t gnutls_est_record_overhead_size(gnutls_protocol_t version, gnutls_cipher_algorithm_t cipher, gnutls_mac_algorithm_t mac, gnutls_compression_method_t comp, unsigned int flags);

ARGUMENTS
       gnutls_protocol_t version
                   is a gnutls_protocol_t value

       gnutls_cipher_algorithm_t cipher
                   is a gnutls_cipher_algorithm_t value

       gnutls_mac_algorithm_t mac
                   is a gnutls_mac_algorithm_t value

       gnutls_compression_method_t comp
                   is a gnutls_compression_method_t value (ignored)

       unsigned int flags
                   must be zero

DESCRIPTION
       This function will return the set size in bytes of the overhead due to TLS (or DTLS) per record.

       Note  that  this  function  may  provide  inaccurate  values  when  TLS  extensions  that  modify  the  record  format  are  negotiated. In these cases a more accurate value can be obtained using
       gnutls_record_overhead_size() after a completed handshake.

SINCE
       3.2.2
