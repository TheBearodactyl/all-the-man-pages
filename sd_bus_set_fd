SD_BUS_SET_FD(3)                 sd_bus_set_fd                SD_BUS_SET_FD(3)

NAME
       sd_bus_set_fd - Set the file descriptors to use for bus communication

SYNOPSIS
       #include <systemd/sd-bus.h>

       int sd_bus_set_fd(sd_bus *bus, int input_fd, int output_fd);

DESCRIPTION
       sd_bus_set_fd() sets the file descriptors used to communicate by a bus
       connection object. Both input_fd and output_fd must be valid file
       descriptors, referring to stream-based file objects (e.g. a stream
       socket, a pair of pipes or FIFOs, or even a TTY device).  input_fd must
       be readable, and output_fd must be writable. The same file descriptor
       may be used (and typically is used) as both the input and the output
       file descriptor. This function must be called before the bus connection
       is started via sd_bus_start(3).

       The bus connection object will take possession of the passed file
       descriptors and will close them automatically when it is freed. Use
       sd_bus_set_close_on_exit(3) to turn off this behaviour.

RETURN VALUE
       On success, sd_bus_set_fd() returns a non-negative integer. On failure,
       it returns a negative errno-style error code.

   Errors
       Returned errors may indicate the following problems:

       -EINVAL
           An invalid bus object was passed.

       -ECHILD
           The bus connection was allocated in a parent process and is being
           reused in a child process after fork().

       -EBADF
           An invalid file descriptor was passed to sd_bus_set_fd().

       -ENOPKG
           The bus cannot be resolved.

       -EPERM
           The bus connection has already been started.

NOTES
       These APIs are implemented as a shared library, which can be compiled
       and linked to with the libsystemd pkg-config(1) file.
