NAME
       npm-shrinkwrap.json - A publishable lockfile

   Description
       npm-shrinkwrap.json  is  a file created by npm help npm shrinkwrap. It is identical to package-lock.json, with one major caveat: Unlike package-lock.json, npm-shrinkwrap.json may be included when
       publishing a package.

       The recommended use-case for npm-shrinkwrap.json is applications deployed through the publishing process on the registry: for example, daemons and command-line tools intended as  global  installs
       or devDependencies. It's strongly discouraged for library authors to publish this file, since that would prevent end users from having control over transitive dependency updates.

       If both package-lock.json and npm-shrinkwrap.json are present in a package root, npm-shrinkwrap.json will be preferred over the package-lock.json file.

       For full details and description of the npm-shrinkwrap.json file format, refer to the manual page for npm help package-lock.json.
