NAME
       roff2ps - transform roff code into ps mode

SYNOPSIS
       roff2ps [groffer-option ...] [--] [filespec ...]

       roff2ps -h
       roff2ps --help

       roff2ps -v
       roff2ps --version

       The  options -v and --version print the version information of the pro‐
       gram to standard output and exit.  The options -h and  --help  print  a
       usage  information  of the program to standard output and stop the pro‐
       gram instantly.

       All other options are assumed to be groffer options.  They  are  inter‐
       nally  passed  to  groffer.  They override the behavior of the program.
       The options are optional, they can be omitted.

       The filespec arguments correspond to the filespec arguments of groffer.
       So they are either the names of existing, readable files or - for stan‐
       dard input, or the name of a man page or a groffer(1) man  page  search
       pattern.   If  no filespec is specified standard input is assumed auto‐
       matically.

DESCRIPTION
       roff2ps transforms roff code into ps mode.  Print the result  to  stan‐
       dard output.

              generates HTML output.

       roff2pdf(1)
              outputs pdf mode.

       roff2text(1)
              generates text output in the groff device latin1.

       roff2x(1)
              prints the output in the groff device X  that  is  suitable  for
              programs like gxditview(1) or xditview(1).
