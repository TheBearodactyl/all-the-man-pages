NAME
       XVisibilityEvent - VisibilityNotify event structure

STRUCTURES
       The structure for VisibilityNotify events contains:

       typedef struct {
               int type;       /* VisibilityNotify */
               unsigned long serial;   /* # of last request processed by server */
               Bool send_event;        /* true if this came from a SendEvent request */
               Display *display;       /* Display the event was read from */
               Window window;
               int state;
       } XVisibilityEvent;

       When you receive this event, the structure members are set as follows.

       The  type  member is set to the event type constant name that uniquely identifies it.  For example, when the X server reports a GraphicsExpose event to a client application, it sends an XGraphic‐
       sExposeEvent structure with the type member set to GraphicsExpose.  The display member is set to a pointer to the display the event was read on.  The send_event member is set to True if the event
       came  from a SendEvent protocol request.  The serial member is set from the serial number reported in the protocol but expanded from the 16-bit least-significant bits to a full 32-bit value.  The
       window member is set to the window that is most useful to toolkit dispatchers.

       The window member is set to the window whose visibility state changes.  The state member is set to the state of the window's visibility and  can  be  VisibilityUnobscured,  VisibilityPartiallyOb‐
       scured,  or  VisibilityFullyObscured.  The X server ignores all of a window's subwindows when determining the visibility state of the window and processes VisibilityNotify events according to the
       following:

       •    When the window changes state from partially obscured, fully obscured, or not viewable to viewable and completely unobscured, the X server generates the event with the state  member  of  the
            XVisibilityEvent structure set to VisibilityUnobscured.

       •    When the window changes state from viewable and completely unobscured or not viewable to viewable and partially obscured, the X server generates the event with the state member of the XVisi‐
            bilityEvent structure set to VisibilityPartiallyObscured.

       •    When the window changes state from viewable and completely unobscured, viewable and partially obscured, or not viewable to viewable and fully obscured, the X server generates the event  with
            the state member of the XVisibilityEvent structure set to VisibilityFullyObscured.
