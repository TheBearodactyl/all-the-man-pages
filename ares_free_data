NAME
       ares_free_data - Free data allocated by several c-ares functions

SYNOPSIS

       void ares_free_data(void *dataptr)

DESCRIPTION
       The  ares_free_data(3) function frees one or more data structures allocated and returned by several c-ares functions. Specifically the data returned by the following list of functions must be de‐
       allocated using this function.

       ares_get_servers(3)
            When used to free the data returned by ares_get_servers(3) this will free the whole linked list of ares_addr_node structures returned by ares_get_servers(3).

       ares_parse_srv_reply(3)
            When used to free the data returned by ares_parse_srv_reply(3) this will free the whole linked list of ares_srv_reply structures returned by ares_parse_srv_reply(3),  along  with  any  addi‐
            tional storage associated with those structures.

       ares_parse_mx_reply(3)
            When  used  to free the data returned by ares_parse_mx_reply(3) this will free the whole linked list of ares_mx_reply structures returned by ares_parse_mx_reply(3), along with any additional
            storage associated with those structures.

       ares_parse_txt_reply(3)
            When used to free the data returned by ares_parse_txt_reply(3) this will free the whole linked list of ares_txt_reply structures returned by ares_parse_txt_reply(3),  along  with  any  addi‐
            tional storage associated with those structures.

       ares_parse_soa_reply(3)
            When  used  to  free  the  data  returned  by  ares_parse_soa_reply(3)  this  will  free  the  ares_soa_reply  structure,  along  with any additional storage associated with those structure.
            ares_parse_uri_reply(3) When used to free the data returned by ares_parse_uri_reply(3) this will free list of ares_uri_reply structures, along with any  additional  storage  associated  with
            those structure.

RETURN VALUE
       The ares_free_data() function does not return a value.

AVAILABILITY
       This function was first introduced in c-ares version 1.7.0.
