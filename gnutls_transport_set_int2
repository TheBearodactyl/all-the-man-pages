NAME
       gnutls_transport_set_int2 - API function

SYNOPSIS
       #include <gnutls/gnutls.h>

       void gnutls_transport_set_int2(gnutls_session_t session, int recv_fd, int send_fd);

ARGUMENTS
       gnutls_session_t session
                   is a gnutls_session_t type.

       int recv_fd is socket descriptor for the pull function

       int send_fd is socket descriptor for the push function

DESCRIPTION
       This  function  sets the first argument of the transport functions, such as send() and recv() for the default callbacks using the system's socket API. With this function you can set two different
       descriptors for receiving and sending.

       This function is equivalent to calling gnutls_transport_set_ptr2() with the descriptors, but requires no casts.
