NAME
       CURLOPT_TRANSFERTEXT - request a text based transfer for FTP

SYNOPSIS
       #include <curl/curl.h>

       CURLcode curl_easy_setopt(CURL *handle, CURLOPT_TRANSFERTEXT, long text);

DESCRIPTION
       A parameter set to 1 tells the library to use ASCII mode for FTP transfers, instead of the default binary transfer. For win32 systems it does not set the stdout to binary mode. This option can be
       usable when transferring text data between systems with different views on certain characters, such as newlines or similar.

       libcurl does not do a complete ASCII conversion when doing ASCII transfers over FTP. This is a known limitation/flaw that nobody has rectified. libcurl simply sets the mode to ASCII and  performs
       a standard transfer.

DEFAULT
       0, disabled

PROTOCOLS
       FTP

EXAMPLE
       CURL *curl = curl_easy_init();
       if(curl) {
         curl_easy_setopt(curl, CURLOPT_URL, "ftp://example.com/textfile");
         curl_easy_setopt(curl, CURLOPT_TRANSFERTEXT, 1L);
         ret = curl_easy_perform(curl);
         curl_easy_cleanup(curl);
       }

AVAILABILITY
       Along with FTP

RETURN VALUE
       Returns CURLE_OK if FTP is supported, and CURLE_UNKNOWN_OPTION if not.
