SD_EVENT_SOURCE_SET_FLOATsd_event_source_set_flSD_EVENT_SOURCE_SET_FLOATING(3)

NAME
       sd_event_source_set_floating, sd_event_source_get_floating - Set or
       retrieve 'floating' state of event sources

SYNOPSIS
       #include <systemd/sd-event.h>

       int sd_event_source_set_floating(sd_event_source *source,
                                        int floating);

       int sd_event_source_get_floating(sd_event_source *source);

DESCRIPTION
       sd_event_source_set_floating() takes a boolean and sets the 'floating'
       state of the specified event source object. This is used to change the
       direction of reference counts for the object and the event loop it is
       associated with. In non-floating mode, the event source object holds a
       reference to the event loop object, but not vice versa. The creator of
       the event source object must hold a reference to it as long as the
       source should exist. In floating mode, the event loop holds a reference
       to the source object, and will decrease the reference count when being
       freed. This means that a reference to the event loop should be held to
       prevent both from being destroyed.

       Various calls that allocate event source objects (i.e.
       sd_event_add_io(3), sd_event_add_time(3) and similar) will
       automatically set an event source object to 'floating' mode if the
       caller passed NULL in the parameter used to return a reference to the
       event source object. Nevertheless, it may be necessary to gain
       temporary access to the source object, for example to adjust event
       source properties after allocation (e.g. its priority or description
       string). In those cases the object may be created in non-floating mode,
       and the returned reference used to adjust the properties, and the
       object marked as floating afterwards, and the reference in the caller
       dropped.

       sd_event_source_get_floating() may be used to query the current
       'floating' state of the event source object source. It returns zero if
       'floating' mode is off, positive if it is on.

RETURN VALUE
       On success, sd_event_source_set_floating() and
       sd_event_source_get_floating() return a non-negative integer. On
       failure, they return a negative errno-style error code.

   Errors
       Returned errors may indicate the following problems:

       -EINVAL
           source is not a valid pointer to an sd_event_source object.

       -ECHILD
           The event loop has been created in a different process.

NOTES
       These APIs are implemented as a shared library, which can be compiled
       and linked to with the libsystemd pkg-config(1) file.
