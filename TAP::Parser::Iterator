NAME
       TAP::Parser::Iterator - Base class for TAP source iterators

VERSION
       Version 3.44

SYNOPSIS
         # to subclass:
         use TAP::Parser::Iterator ();
         use base 'TAP::Parser::Iterator';
         sub _initialize {
           # see TAP::Object...
         }

         sub next_raw { ... }
         sub wait     { ... }
         sub exit     { ... }

DESCRIPTION
       This is a simple iterator base class that defines TAP::Parser's iterator API.  Iterators are typically created from TAP::Parser::SourceHandlers.

METHODS
   Class Methods
       "new"

       Create an iterator.  Provided by TAP::Object.

   Instance Methods
       "next"

        while ( my $item = $iter->next ) { ... }

       Iterate through it, of course.

       "next_raw"

       Note: this method is abstract and should be overridden.

        while ( my $item = $iter->next_raw ) { ... }

       Iterate raw input without applying any fixes for quirky input syntax.

       "handle_unicode"

       If necessary switch the input stream to handle unicode. This only has any effect for I/O handle based streams.

       The default implementation does nothing.

       "get_select_handles"

       Return a list of filehandles that may be used upstream in a select() call to signal that this Iterator is ready. Iterators that are not handle-based should return an empty list.

       The default implementation does nothing.

       "wait"

       Note: this method is abstract and should be overridden.

        my $wait_status = $iter->wait;

       Return the "wait" status for this iterator.

       "exit"

       Note: this method is abstract and should be overridden.

        my $wait_status = $iter->exit;

       Return the "exit" status for this iterator.

SUBCLASSING
       Please see "SUBCLASSING" in TAP::Parser for a subclassing overview.

       You must override the abstract methods as noted above.

   Example
       TAP::Parser::Iterator::Array is probably the easiest example to follow.  There's not much point repeating it here.
