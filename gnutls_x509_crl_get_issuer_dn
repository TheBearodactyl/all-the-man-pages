NAME
       gnutls_x509_crl_get_issuer_dn - API function

SYNOPSIS
       #include <gnutls/x509.h>

       int gnutls_x509_crl_get_issuer_dn(gnutls_x509_crl_t crl, char * buf, size_t * sizeof_buf);

ARGUMENTS
       gnutls_x509_crl_t crl
                   should contain a gnutls_x509_crl_t type

       char * buf  a pointer to a structure to hold the peer's name (may be null)

       size_t * sizeof_buf
                   initially holds the size of  buf

DESCRIPTION
       This  function  will copy the name of the CRL issuer in the provided buffer. The name will be in the form "C=xxxx,O=yyyy,CN=zzzz" as described in RFC4514. The output string will be ASCII or UTF-8
       encoded, depending on the certificate data.

       If buf is NULL then only the size will be filled.

       This function does not output a fully RFC4514 compliant string, if that is required see gnutls_x509_crl_get_issuer_dn3().

RETURNS
       GNUTLS_E_SHORT_MEMORY_BUFFER if the provided buffer is not long enough, and in that case the sizeof_buf will be updated with the required size, and 0 on success.
