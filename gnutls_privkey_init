NAME
       gnutls_privkey_init - API function

SYNOPSIS
       #include <gnutls/abstract.h>

       int gnutls_privkey_init(gnutls_privkey_t * key);

ARGUMENTS
       gnutls_privkey_t * key
                   A pointer to the type to be initialized

DESCRIPTION
       This function will initialize a private key object. The object can be used to generate, import, and perform cryptographic operations on the associated private key.

       Note  that  when  the  underlying private key is a PKCS11 key (i.e., when imported with a PKCS11 URI), the limitations of gnutls_pkcs11_privkey_init() apply to this object as well. In versions of
       GnuTLS later than 3.5.11 the object is protected using locks and a single gnutls_privkey_t can be re-used by many threads. However, for performance it is recommended to utilize one object per key
       per thread.

RETURNS
       On success, GNUTLS_E_SUCCESS (0) is returned, otherwise a negative error value.

SINCE
       2.12.0
