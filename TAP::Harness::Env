NAME
       TAP::Harness::Env - Parsing harness related environmental variables where appropriate

VERSION
       Version 3.44

SYNOPSIS
        my $harness = TAP::Harness::Env->create(\%extra_args)

DESCRIPTION
       This module implements the environmental variables that Test::Harness uses with TAP::Harness, and instantiates the appropriate class with the appropriate arguments.

METHODS
       â€¢   create( \%args )

           This function reads the environment and generates an appropriate argument hash from it. If given any arguments in %extra_args, these will override the environmental defaults. In accepts
           "harness_class" (which defaults to "TAP::Harness"), and any argument the harness class accepts.

ENVIRONMENTAL VARIABLES
       "HARNESS_PERL_SWITCHES"
           Setting this adds perl command line switches to each test file run.

           For example, "HARNESS_PERL_SWITCHES=-T" will turn on taint mode.  "HARNESS_PERL_SWITCHES=-MDevel::Cover" will run "Devel::Cover" for each test.

       "HARNESS_VERBOSE"
           If true, "TAP::Harness" will output the verbose results of running its tests.

       "HARNESS_SUBCLASS"
           Specifies a TAP::Harness subclass to be used in place of TAP::Harness.

       "HARNESS_OPTIONS"
           Provide additional options to the harness. Currently supported options are:

           "j<n>"
               Run <n> (default 9) parallel jobs.

           "c" Try to color output. See "new" in TAP::Formatter::Base.

           "a<file.tgz>"
               Will use TAP::Harness::Archive as the harness class, and save the TAP to "file.tgz"

           "fPackage-With-Dashes"
               Set the formatter_class of the harness being run. Since the "HARNESS_OPTIONS" is separated by ":", we use "-" instead.

           Multiple options may be separated by colons:

               HARNESS_OPTIONS=j9:c make test

       "HARNESS_TIMER"
           Setting this to true will make the harness display the number of milliseconds each test took.  You can also use prove's "--timer" switch.

       "HARNESS_COLOR"
           Attempt to produce color output.

       "HARNESS_IGNORE_EXIT"
           If set to a true value instruct "TAP::Parser" to ignore exit and wait status from test scripts.
