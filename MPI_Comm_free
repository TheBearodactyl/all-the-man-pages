NAME
       MPI_Comm_free  - Mark a communicator object for deallocation.

SYNTAX
C Syntax
       #include <mpi.h>
       int MPI_Comm_free(MPI_Comm *comm)

Fortran Syntax
       USE MPI
       ! or the older form: INCLUDE 'mpif.h'
       MPI_COMM_FREE(COMM, IERROR)
            INTEGER   COMM, IERROR

Fortran 2008 Syntax
       USE mpi_f08
       MPI_Comm_free(comm, ierror)
            TYPE(MPI_Comm), INTENT(INOUT) :: comm
            INTEGER, OPTIONAL, INTENT(OUT) :: ierror

C++ Syntax
       #include <mpi.h>
       void Comm::Free()

INPUT PARAMETER
       comm      Communicator to be destroyed (handle).

OUTPUT PARAMETER
       IERROR    Fortran only: Error status (integer).

DESCRIPTION
       This operation marks the communicator object for deallocation. The handle is set to MPI_COMM_NULL. Any pending operations that use this communicator will complete normally; the object is actually
       deallocated only if there are no other active references to it. This call applies to intracommunicators and intercommunicators. Upon actual deallocation, the delete  callback  functions  for  all
       cached attributes (see Section 5.7 in the MPI-1 Standard, "Caching") are called in arbitrary order.

NOTES
       Note  that  it  is not defined by the MPI standard what happens if the delete_fn callback invokes other MPI functions.  In Open MPI, it is not valid for delete_fn callbacks (or any of their chil‐
       dren) to add or delete attributes on the same object on which the delete_fn callback is being invoked.

ERRORS
       Almost all MPI routines return an error value; C routines as the value of the function and Fortran routines in the last argument. C++ functions do not return errors. If the default error  handler
       is set to MPI::ERRORS_THROW_EXCEPTIONS, then on error the C++ exception mechanism will be used to throw an MPI::Exception object.

       Before  the  error  value is returned, the current MPI error handler is called. By default, this error handler aborts the MPI job, except for I/O function errors. The error handler may be changed
       with MPI_Comm_set_errhandler; the predefined error handler MPI_ERRORS_RETURN may be used to cause error values to be returned. Note that MPI does not guarantee that an MPI  program  can  continue
       past an error.
