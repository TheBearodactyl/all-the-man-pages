NAME
       gnutls_pkcs12_simple_parse - API function

SYNOPSIS
       #include <gnutls/pkcs12.h>

       int gnutls_pkcs12_simple_parse(gnutls_pkcs12_t p12, const char * password, gnutls_x509_privkey_t * key, gnutls_x509_crt_t ** chain, unsigned int * chain_len, gnutls_x509_crt_t ** extra_certs, un‐
       signed int * extra_certs_len, gnutls_x509_crl_t * crl, unsigned int flags);

ARGUMENTS
       gnutls_pkcs12_t p12
                   A pkcs12 type

       const char * password
                   optional password used to decrypt the structure, bags and keys.

       gnutls_x509_privkey_t * key
                   a structure to store the parsed private key.

       gnutls_x509_crt_t ** chain
                   the corresponding to key certificate chain (may be NULL)

       unsigned int * chain_len
                   will be updated with the number of additional (may be NULL)

       gnutls_x509_crt_t ** extra_certs
                   optional pointer to receive an array of additional certificates found in the PKCS12 structure (may be NULL).

       unsigned int * extra_certs_len
                   will be updated with the number of additional certs (may be NULL).

       gnutls_x509_crl_t * crl
                   an optional structure to store the parsed CRL (may be NULL).

       unsigned int flags
                   should be zero or one of GNUTLS_PKCS12_SP_*

DESCRIPTION
       This function parses a PKCS12 structure in  pkcs12 and extracts the private key, the corresponding certificate chain, any additional certificates and a CRL. The structures in  key ,  chain  crl ,
       and  extra_certs must not be initialized.

       The   extra_certs and  extra_certs_len parameters are optional and both may be set to NULL. If either is non-NULL, then both must be set. The value for  extra_certs is allocated using gnutls_mal‐
       loc().

       Encrypted PKCS12 bags and PKCS8 private keys are supported, but only with password based security and the same password for all operations.

       Note that a PKCS12 structure may contain many keys and/or certificates, and there is no way to identify which key/certificate pair you want.  For this reason this function is  useful  for  PKCS12
       files that contain only one key/certificate pair and/or one CRL.

       If the provided structure has encrypted fields but no password is provided then this function returns GNUTLS_E_DECRYPTION_FAILED.

       Note  that normally the chain constructed does not include self signed certificates, to comply with TLS' requirements. If, however, the flag GNUTLS_PKCS12_SP_INCLUDE_SELF_SIGNED is specified then
       self signed certificates will be included in the chain.

       Prior to using this function the PKCS 12 structure integrity must be verified using gnutls_pkcs12_verify_mac().

RETURNS
       On success, GNUTLS_E_SUCCESS (0) is returned, otherwise a negative error value.
