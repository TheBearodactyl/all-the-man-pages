NAME
       CURLOPT_RESOLVER_START_FUNCTION - callback called before a new name resolve is started

SYNOPSIS
       #include <curl/curl.h>

       int resolver_start_cb(void *resolver_state, void *reserved, void *userdata);

       CURLcode curl_easy_setopt(CURL *handle,
                                 CURLOPT_RESOLVER_START_FUNCTION,
                                 resolver_start_cb);

DESCRIPTION
       Pass a pointer to your callback function, which should match the prototype shown above.

       This callback function gets called by libcurl every time before a new resolve request is started.

       resolver_state  points  to a backend-specific resolver state. Currently only the ares resolver backend has a resolver state. It can be used to set up any desired option on the ares channel before
       it's used, for example setting up socket callback options.

       reserved is reserved.

       userdata is the user pointer set with the CURLOPT_RESOLVER_START_DATA(3) option.

       The callback must return 0 on success. Returning a non-zero value will cause the resolve to fail.

DEFAULT
       NULL (No callback)

PROTOCOLS
       All

EXAMPLE
       static int resolver_start_cb(void *resolver_state, void *reserved,
                                    void *userdata)
       {
         (void)reserved;
         printf("Received resolver_state=%p userdata=%p\n",
                resolver_state, userdata);
         return 0;
       }

       CURL *curl = curl_easy_init();
       if(curl) {
         curl_easy_setopt(curl, CURLOPT_RESOLVER_START_FUNCTION, resolver_start_cb);
         curl_easy_setopt(curl, CURLOPT_RESOLVER_START_DATA, curl);
         curl_easy_setopt(curl, CURLOPT_URL, "https://example.com");
         curl_easy_perform(curl);
         curl_easy_cleanup(curl);
       }
