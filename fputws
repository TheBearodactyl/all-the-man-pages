NAME
       fputws - write a wide-character string to a FILE stream

LIBRARY
       Standard C library (libc, -lc)

SYNOPSIS
       #include <wchar.h>

       int fputws(const wchar_t *restrict ws, FILE *restrict stream);

DESCRIPTION
       The  fputws()  function is the wide-character equivalent of the fputs(3) function.  It writes the wide-character string starting at ws, up to but not including the terminating null wide character
       (L'\0'), to stream.

       For a nonlocking counterpart, see unlocked_stdio(3).

RETURN VALUE
       The fputws() function returns a nonnegative integer if the operation was successful, or -1 to indicate an error.

ATTRIBUTES
       For an explanation of the terms used in this section, see attributes(7).

STANDARDS
       C11, POSIX.1-2008.

HISTORY
       POSIX.1-2001, C99.

NOTES
       The behavior of fputws() depends on the LC_CTYPE category of the current locale.

       In the absence of additional information passed to the fopen(3) call, it is reasonable to expect that fputws() will actually write the multibyte string corresponding to the wide-character  string
       ws.

PROLOG

       the interface may not be implemented on Linux.

NAME
       fputws — put a wide-character string on a stream

SYNOPSIS
       #include <stdio.h>
       #include <wchar.h>

       int fputws(const wchar_t *restrict ws, FILE *restrict stream);

DESCRIPTION
       The functionality described on this reference page is aligned with the ISO C standard. Any conflict between the requirements described here and the ISO C standard is unintentional. This volume of
       POSIX.1‐2017 defers to the ISO C standard.

       The  fputws() function shall write a character string corresponding to the (null-terminated) wide-character string pointed to by ws to the stream pointed to by stream.  No character corresponding
       to the terminating null wide-character code shall be written.

       The last data modification and last file status change timestamps of the file shall be marked for update between the successful execution of fputws() and the next successful completion of a  call
       to fflush() or fclose() on the same stream or a call to exit() or abort().

RETURN VALUE
       Upon successful completion, fputws() shall return a non-negative number. Otherwise, it shall return -1, set an error indicator for the stream, and set errno to indicate the error.

ERRORS
       Refer to fputwc().

       The following sections are informative.

EXAMPLES
       None.

APPLICATION USAGE
       The fputws() function does not append a <newline>.

       This volume of POSIX.1‐2017 requires that successful completion simply return a non-negative integer. There are at least three known different implementation conventions for this requirement:

        *  Return a constant value.

        *  Return the last character written.

        *  Return the number of bytes written. Note that this implementation convention cannot be adhered to for strings longer than {INT_MAX} bytes as the value would not be representable in the return
           type of the function. For backwards-compatibility, implementations can return the number of bytes for strings of up to {INT_MAX} bytes, and return {INT_MAX} for all longer strings.

RATIONALE
       None.

FUTURE DIRECTIONS
       None.
