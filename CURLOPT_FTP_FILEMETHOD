NAME
       CURLOPT_FTP_FILEMETHOD - select directory traversing method for FTP

SYNOPSIS
       #include <curl/curl.h>

       CURLcode curl_easy_setopt(CURL *handle, CURLOPT_FTP_FILEMETHOD,
                                 long method);

DESCRIPTION
       Pass a long telling libcurl which method to use to reach a file on a FTP(S) server.

       This option exists because some server implementations are not compliant to what the standards say should work.

       The argument should be one of the following alternatives:

       CURLFTPMETHOD_MULTICWD
              libcurl  does a single CWD operation for each path part in the given URL. For deep hierarchies this means many commands. This is how RFC1738 says it should be done. This is the default but
              the slowest behavior.

       CURLFTPMETHOD_NOCWD
              libcurl does no CWD at all. libcurl will do SIZE, RETR, STOR etc and give a full path to the server for all these commands. This is the fastest behavior.

       CURLFTPMETHOD_SINGLECWD
              libcurl does one CWD with the full target directory and then operates on the file "normally" (like in the multicwd case). This is somewhat more standards compliant than 'nocwd' but without
              the full penalty of 'multicwd'.

DEFAULT
       CURLFTPMETHOD_MULTICWD

PROTOCOLS
       FTP

EXAMPLE
       CURL *curl = curl_easy_init();
       if(curl) {
         curl_easy_setopt(curl, CURLOPT_URL, "ftp://example.com/1/2/3/4/new.txt");
         curl_easy_setopt(curl, CURLOPT_FTP_FILEMETHOD,
                          (long)CURLFTPMETHOD_SINGLECWD);

         ret = curl_easy_perform(curl);

         curl_easy_cleanup(curl);
       }

AVAILABILITY
       Added in 7.15.1

RETURN VALUE
       Returns CURLE_OK if the option is supported, and CURLE_UNKNOWN_OPTION if not.
