NAME
       gnutls_record_send_early_data - API function

SYNOPSIS
       #include <gnutls/gnutls.h>

       ssize_t gnutls_record_send_early_data(gnutls_session_t session, const void * data, size_t data_size);

ARGUMENTS
       gnutls_session_t session
                   is a gnutls_session_t type.

       const void * data
                   contains the data to send

       size_t data_size
                   is the length of the data

DESCRIPTION
       This  function  can be used by a client to send data early in the handshake processes when resuming a session.  This is used to implement a zero-roundtrip (0-RTT) mode.  It has the same semantics
       as gnutls_record_send().

       There may be a  limit  to  the  amount  of  data  sent  as  early  data.   Use  gnutls_record_get_max_early_data_size()  to  check  the  limit.   If  the  limit  exceeds,  this  function  returns
       GNUTLS_E_RECORD_LIMIT_REACHED.

RETURNS
       The  number  of bytes sent, or a negative error code.  The number of bytes sent might be less than  data_size .  The maximum number of bytes this function can send in a single call depends on the
       negotiated maximum record size.

SINCE
       3.6.5
