NAME
       strfmon, strfmon_l - convert monetary value to a string

LIBRARY
       Standard C library (libc, -lc)

SYNOPSIS
       #include <monetary.h>

       ssize_t strfmon(char s[restrict .max], size_t max,
                       const char *restrict format, ...);
       ssize_t strfmon_l(char s[restrict .max], size_t max, locale_t locale,
                       const char *restrict format, ...);

DESCRIPTION
       The  strfmon() function formats the specified monetary amount according
       to the current locale and format specification format  and  places  the
       result in the character array s of size max.

       The  strfmon_l()  function  performs the same task, but uses the locale
       specified by locale.  The behavior of strfmon_l() is undefined  if  lo‐
       cale  is  the special locale object LC_GLOBAL_LOCALE (see duplocale(3))
       or is not a valid locale object handle.

       Ordinary characters in format are copied to s without conversion.  Con‐
       version specifiers are introduced by a '%' character.  Immediately fol‐
       lowing it there can be zero or more of the following flags:

       =f     The single-byte character f is used as the numeric fill  charac‐
              ter  (to  be  used  with a left precision, see below).  When not
              specified, the space character is used.

       ^      Do not use any grouping characters that might be defined for the
              current locale.  By default, grouping is enabled.

       ( or + The  (  flag  indicates that negative amounts should be enclosed
              between parentheses.  The + flag indicates that signs should  be
              handled in the default way, that is, amounts are preceded by the
              locale's sign indication, for example, nothing for positive, "-"
              for negative.

       !      Omit the currency symbol.

       -      Left justify all fields.  The default is right justification.

       Next,  there  may be a field width: a decimal digit string specifying a
       minimum field width in bytes.  The default is 0.  A result smaller than
       this  width is padded with spaces (on the left, unless the left-justify
       flag was given).

       Next, there may be a left precision of the form "#" followed by a deci‐
       mal  digit string.  If the number of digits left of the radix character
       is smaller than this, the representation is padded on the left with the
       numeric  fill  character.   Grouping characters are not counted in this
       field width.

       Next, there may be a right precision of the form "." followed by a dec‐
       imal digit string.  The amount being formatted is rounded to the speci‐
       fied number of digits prior to formatting.  The default is specified in
       the  frac_digits  and  int_frac_digits items of the current locale.  If
       the right precision is 0, no radix character is  printed.   (The  radix
       character  here  is determined by LC_MONETARY, and may differ from that
       specified by LC_NUMERIC.)

       Finally, the conversion specification must be ended with  a  conversion
       character.  The three conversion characters are

       %      (In  this  case, the entire specification must be exactly "%%".)
              Put a '%' character in the result string.

       i      One argument of type double is converted using the locale's  in‐
              ternational currency format.

       n      One  argument of type double is converted using the locale's na‐
              tional currency format.

RETURN VALUE
       The strfmon() function returns the number of characters placed  in  the
       array  s, not including the terminating null byte, provided the string,
       including the terminating null byte, fits.  Otherwise, it sets errno to
       E2BIG, returns -1, and the contents of the array is undefined.

NAME
       strfmon, strfmon_l — convert monetary value to a string

SYNOPSIS
       #include <monetary.h>

       ssize_t strfmon(char *restrict s, size_t maxsize,
           const char *restrict format, ...);
       ssize_t strfmon_l(char *restrict s, size_t maxsize,
           locale_t locale, const char *restrict format, ...);

DESCRIPTION
       The strfmon() function shall place characters into the array pointed to
       by  s  as  controlled by the string pointed to by format.  No more than
       maxsize bytes are placed into the array.

       The format is a character string, beginning and ending in  its  initial
       state,  if  any,  that contains two types of objects: plain characters,
       which are simply copied to the output stream, and conversion specifica‐
       tions, each of which shall result in the fetching of zero or more argu‐
       ments which are converted and formatted. The results are  undefined  if
       there  are  insufficient arguments for the format. If the format is ex‐
       hausted while arguments remain, the excess  arguments  are  simply  ig‐
       nored.

       The  application  shall ensure that a conversion specification consists
       of the following sequence:

        *  A '%' character

        *  Optional flags

        *  Optional field width

        *  Optional left precision

        *  Optional right precision

        *  A required conversion specifier character that determines the  con‐
           version to be performed

       The strfmon_l() function shall be equivalent to the strfmon() function,
       except that the locale data used is from the locale represented by  lo‐
       cale.

   Flags
       One or more of the following optional flags can be specified to control
       the conversion:

       =f      An '=' followed by a single character f which is  used  as  the
               numeric  fill  character.  In  order  to work with precision or
               width counts, the fill character shall be a single byte charac‐
               ter;  if  not,  the  behavior is undefined. The default numeric
               fill character is the <space>.  This flag does not affect field
               width  filling which always uses the <space>.  This flag is ig‐
               nored unless a left precision (see below) is specified.

       ^       Do not format the currency amount with grouping characters. The
               default is to insert the grouping characters if defined for the
               current locale.

       + or (  Specify the style of representing positive  and  negative  cur‐
               rency  amounts. Only one of '+' or '(' may be specified. If '+'
               is specified, the locale's equivalent of '+' and '-'  are  used
               (for example, in many locales, the empty string if positive and
               '-' if negative). If '(' is specified, negative amounts are en‐
               closed  within  parentheses.  If neither flag is specified, the
               '+' style is used.

       !       Suppress the currency symbol from the output conversion.

       -       Specify the alignment. If this flag is present  the  result  of
               the  conversion  is left-justified (padded to the right) rather
               than right-justified. This flag shall be ignored unless a field
               width (see below) is specified.

   Field Width
       w       A  decimal  digit  string w specifying a minimum field width in
               bytes in which the result of the conversion is  right-justified
               (or  left-justified  if the flag '-' is specified). The default
               is 0.

   Left Precision
       #n      A '#' followed by a decimal digit string n specifying a maximum
               number  of  digits  expected to be formatted to the left of the
               radix character. This option can be used to keep the  formatted
               output from multiple calls to the strfmon() function aligned in
               the same columns. It can also be used to fill unused  positions
               with  a  special  character  as  in  "$***123.45".  This option
               causes an amount to be formatted as if it  has  the  number  of
               digits  specified by n.  If more than n digit positions are re‐
               quired, this conversion specification is ignored.  Digit  posi‐
               tions  in excess of those actually required are filled with the
               numeric fill character (see the =f flag above).

               If grouping has not been suppressed with the '^' flag,  and  it
               is  defined for the current locale, grouping separators are in‐
               serted before the fill characters (if any) are added.  Grouping
               separators  are not applied to fill characters even if the fill
               character is a digit.

               To ensure alignment, any characters appearing before  or  after
               the  number  in  the  formatted output such as currency or sign
               symbols are padded as necessary with <space> characters to make
               their positive and negative formats an equal length.

   Right Precision
       .p      A  <period> followed by a decimal digit string p specifying the
               number of digits after the radix character. If the value of the
               right  precision p is 0, no radix character appears. If a right
               precision is not included, a default specified by  the  current
               locale  is  used.  The amount being formatted is rounded to the
               specified number of digits prior to formatting.

   Conversion Specifier Characters
       The conversion specifier characters and their meanings are:

       i       The double argument is formatted according to the locale's  in‐
               ternational  currency  format  (for  example,  in  the  US: USD
               1,234.56). If the argument is ±Inf or NaN, the  result  of  the
               conversion is unspecified.

       n       The  double argument is formatted according to the locale's na‐
               tional currency format (for example, in the US: $1,234.56).  If
               the  argument  is  ±Inf or NaN, the result of the conversion is
               unspecified.

       %       Convert to a '%'; no argument is converted. The entire  conver‐
               sion specification shall be %%.

   Locale Information
       The  LC_MONETARY category of the current locale affects the behavior of
       this function including the monetary radix character (which may be dif‐
       ferent from the numeric radix character affected by the LC_NUMERIC cat‐
       egory), the grouping separator, the currency symbols, and formats.  The
       international   currency   symbol   should   be   conformant  with  the
       ISO 4217:2001 standard.

       If the value of maxsize is greater than {SSIZE_MAX}, the result is  im‐
       plementation-defined.

       The  behavior is undefined if the locale argument to strfmon_l() is the
       special locale object LC_GLOBAL_LOCALE or is not a valid locale  object
       handle.

RETURN VALUE
       If  the  total number of resulting bytes including the terminating null
       byte is not more than maxsize, these functions shall return the  number
       of  bytes placed into the array pointed to by s, not including the ter‐
       minating NUL character. Otherwise, -1 shall be returned,  the  contents
       of  the  array  are unspecified, and errno shall be set to indicate the
       error.

ERRORS
       These functions shall fail if:

       E2BIG  Conversion stopped due to lack of space in the buffer.

       The following sections are informative.

EXAMPLES
       Given a locale for the US and the values 123.45, -123.45, and 3456.781,
       the following output might be produced. Square brackets ("[]") are used
       in this example to delimit the output.
