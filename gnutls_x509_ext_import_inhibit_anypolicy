NAME
       gnutls_x509_ext_import_inhibit_anypolicy - API function

SYNOPSIS
       #include <gnutls/x509-ext.h>

       int gnutls_x509_ext_import_inhibit_anypolicy(const gnutls_datum_t * ext, unsigned int * skipcerts);

ARGUMENTS
       const gnutls_datum_t * ext
                   the DER encoded extension data

       unsigned int * skipcerts
                   will hold the number of certificates after which anypolicy is no longer acceptable.

DESCRIPTION
       This function will return certificate's value of SkipCerts, by reading the DER data of the Inhibit anyPolicy X.509 extension (2.5.29.54).

       The  skipcerts value is the number of additional certificates that may appear in the path before the anyPolicy (GNUTLS_X509_OID_POLICY_ANY) is no longer acceptable.

RETURNS
       zero, or a negative error code in case of parsing error.  If the certificate does not contain the Inhibit anyPolicy extension GNUTLS_E_REQUESTED_DATA_NOT_AVAILABLE will be returned.
