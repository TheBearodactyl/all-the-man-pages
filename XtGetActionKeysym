NAME
       XtGetActionKeysym - obtain corresponding keysym

SYNTAX
       #include <X11/Intrinsic.h>

       KeySym XtGetActionKeysym(XEvent* event, Modifiers* modifiers_return);

ARGUMENTS
       event     Specifies the event pointer passed to the action procedure by the Intrinsics.

       modifiers_return
                 Returns the modifiers that caused the match, if non-NULL.

DESCRIPTION
       If XtGetActionKeysym is called after an action procedure has been invoked by the Intrinsics and before that action procedure returns, and if the event pointer has the same value as the event
       pointer passed to that action routine, and if the event is a KeyPress or KeyRelease event, then XtGetActionKeysym returns the KeySym that matched the final event specification in the translation
       table and, if modifiers_return is non-NULL, the modifier state actually used to generate this KeySym; otherwise, if the event is a KeyPress or KeyRelease event, then XtGetActionKeysym calls Xt‚Äê
       TranslateKeycode and returns the results; else it returns NoSymbol and does not examine modifiers_return.
