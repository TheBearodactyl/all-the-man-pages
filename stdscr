DESCRIPTION
       This page summarizes variables provided by the curses library.  A  more
       complete description is given in the curses(3X) manual page.

       Depending  on  the  configuration,  these  may  be actual variables, or
       macros (see curs_threads(3X) and curs_opaque(3X)) which  provide  read-
       only  access  to  curses's  state.  In either case, applications should
       treat them as read-only to avoid confusing the library.

   COLOR_PAIRS
       After initializing curses, this variable contains the number  of  color
       pairs  which  the  terminal  can  support.  Usually the number of color
       pairs will be the product COLORS*COLORS, however  this  is  not  always
       true:

       •   a few terminals use HLS colors, which do not follow this rule

       •   terminals  supporting  a  large number of colors are limited by the
           number of color pairs that can be represented  in  a  signed  short
           value.

   COLORS
       After  initializing curses, this variable contains the number of colors
       which the terminal can support.

   COLS
       After initializing curses, this variable  contains  the  width  of  the
       screen, i.e., the number of columns.

   ESCDELAY
       This variable holds the number of milliseconds to wait after reading an
       escape character, to distinguish between an individual escape character
       entered on the keyboard from escape sequences sent by cursor- and func‐
       tion-keys (see curses(3X)).

   LINES
       After initializing curses, this variable contains  the  height  of  the
       screen, i.e., the number of lines.

   TABSIZE
       This  variable  holds  the number of columns used by the curses library
       when converting a tab character to spaces as it adds the tab to a  win‐
       dow (see curs_addch(3X).

   The Current Screen
       This  implementation  of  curses uses a special window curscr to record
       its updates to the terminal screen.

       This is referred to as the “physical screen”  in  the  curs_refresh(3X)
       and curs_outopts(3X) manual pages.

   The New Screen
       This  implementation of curses uses a special window newscr to hold up‐
       dates to the terminal screen before applying them to curscr.

       This is referred to as the “virtual  screen”  in  the  curs_kernel(3X),
       curs_refresh(3X) and curs_outopts(3X) manual pages.

   The Standard Screen
       Upon  initializing curses, a default window called stdscr, which is the
       size of the terminal screen, is created.   Many  curses  functions  use
       this window.

NOTES
       The   curses  library  is  initialized  using  either  initscr(3X),  or
       newterm(3X).

       If curses is configured to use separate curses/terminfo libraries, most
       of these variables reside in the curses library.

PORTABILITY
       TABSIZE  is  a feature of SVr4 curses which is not documented by X/Open
       curses.

       •   In SVr4 curses, TABSIZE is initially set from the terminal descrip‐
           tion's  init_tabs capability.  After that, it can be altered by the
           applications using SVr4 curses.

           SVr4 curses uses the current value of TABSIZE to compute the  posi‐
           tion  of  tabstops  for  updating both the virtual screen with add‐
           ch(3X) as well as the physical screen with mvcur(3X).

       •   This implementation uses the current value of TABSIZE only for  up‐
           dating  the  virtual screen.  It uses the terminal description's it
           (init_tabs) capability for computing hardware tabs (i.e., tab stops
           on the physical screen).

       •   Other  implementations  differ.  For instance, NetBSD curses allows
           TABSIZE to be set through an environment variable.  This  implemen‐
           tation does not.

           NetBSD curses does not support hardware tabs; it uses the init_tabs
           capability and the TABSIZE variable only for updating  the  virtual
           screen.

       ESCDELAY is an extension in AIX curses:

       •   In AIX, the units for ESCDELAY are fifths of a millisecond.

       •   The default value for AIX's ESCDELAY is 0.1 seconds.

       •   AIX  also enforces a limit of 10,000 seconds for ESCDELAY; this im‐
           plementation currently has no upper limit.

       This implementation has long used ESCDELAY with units of  milliseconds,
       making  it  impossible to be completely compatible with AIX.  Likewise,
       most users have either decided to override the value, or rely upon  its
       default value.
