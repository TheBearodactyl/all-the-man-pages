IOCTL-XFS-FSBULKSTAT(2)                                                                     System Calls Manual                                                                    IOCTL-XFS-FSBULKSTAT(2)

NAME
       ioctl_xfs_fsbulkstat - query information for a batch of XFS inodes

SYNOPSIS
       #include <xfs/xfs_fs.h>

       int ioctl(int fd, XFS_IOC_FSBULKSTAT, struct xfs_fsop_bulkreq *arg);
       int ioctl(int fd, XFS_IOC_FSBULKSTAT_SINGLE, struct xfs_fsop_bulkreq *arg);

DESCRIPTION
       Query stat information for a group of XFS inodes.

       NOTE: This ioctl has been superseded.  Please see the ioctl_xfs_bulkstat(2) manpage for information about its replacement.

       These ioctls use struct xfs_fsop_bulkreq to set up a bulk transfer with the kernel:

           struct xfs_fsop_bulkreq {
                __u64             *lastip;
                __s32             count;
                void              *ubuffer;
                __s32             *ocount;
           };

       lastip  points  to a value that will receive the number of the "last inode."  This cannot be NULL.  For FSBULKSTAT, this should be set to one less than the number of the first inode for which the
       caller wants information, or zero to start with the first inode in the filesystem.  For FSBULKSTAT_SINGLE, this should be set to the number of the inode for which the  caller  wants  information.
       After the call, this value will be set to the number of the last inode for which information was supplied.  This field will not be updated if ocount is NULL.

       count is the number of elements in the ubuffer array and therefore the number of inodes for which to return stat information.  This value must be set to 1 for FSBULKSTAT_SINGLE.

       ocount points to a value that will receive the number of records returned.  If this value is NULL, then neither ocount nor lastip will be updated.

       ubuffer points to a memory buffer into which inode stat information will be copied.  This buffer must be an array of struct xfs_bstat which is described below.  The array must have at least count
       elements.

           struct xfs_bstat {
                __u64             bs_ino;
                __u16             bs_mode;
                __u16             bs_nlink;
                __u32             bs_uid;
                __u32             bs_gid;
                __u32             bs_rdev;
                __s32             bs_blksize;
                __s64             bs_size;
                struct xfs_bstime bs_atime;
                struct xfs_bstime bs_mtime;
                struct xfs_bstime bs_ctime;
                int64_t           bs_blocks;
                __u32             bs_xflags;
                __s32             bs_extsize;
                __s32             bs_extents;
                __u32             bs_gen;
                __u16             bs_projid_lo;
                __u16             bs_forkoff;
                __u16             bs_projid_hi;
                uint16_t          bs_sick;
                uint16_t          bs_checked;
                unsigned char     bs_pad[2];
                __u32             bs_cowextsize;
                __u32             bs_dmevmask;
                __u16             bs_dmstate;
                __u16             bs_aextents;
           };

       The structure members are as follows:

       bs_ino is the inode number for this record.

       bs_mode is the file type and mode.

       bs_nlink is the number of hard links to this inode.

       bs_uid is the user id.

       bs_gid is the group id.

       bs_rdev is the encoded device id if this is a special file.

       bs_blksize is the size of a data block for this file, in units of bytes.

       bs_size is the size of the file, in bytes.

       bs_atime is the last time this file was accessed.

       bs_mtime is the last time the contents of this file were modified.

       bs_ctime is the last time this inode record was modified.

       bs_blocks is the number of filesystem blocks allocated to this file, including metadata.

       bs_xflags contains the extended flags that are set on this inode.  These flags are the same values as those defined in the XFS INODE FLAGS section of the ioctl_xfs_fsgetxattr(2) manpage.

       bs_extsize is the extent size hint for this file, in bytes.

       bs_extents is the number of storage mappings associated with this file's data.

       bs_gen is the generation number of the inode record.

       bs_projid_lo is the lower 16-bits of the project id.

       bs_forkoff is the offset of the attribute fork in the inode record, in bytes.

       bs_projid_hi is the upper 16-bits of the project id.

       bs_pad[6] is zeroed.

       bs_cowextsize is the Copy on Write extent size hint for this file, in bytes.

       bs_dmevmask is unused on Linux.

       bs_dmstate is unused on Linux.

       bs_aextents is the number of storage mappings associated with this file's extended attributes.

       The fields bs_sick and bs_checked indicate the relative health of various inode metadata:

       • If a given sick flag is set in bs_sick, then that piece of metadata has been observed to be damaged.  The same bit should be set in bs_checked.

       • If a given sick flag is set in bs_checked but is not set in bs_sick, then that piece of metadata has been checked and is not faulty.

       • If a given sick flag is not set in bs_checked, then no conclusion can be made.

       The following flags apply to these fields:

           XFS_BS_SICK_INODE
                  The inode's record itself.

           XFS_BS_SICK_BMBTD

           XFS_BS_SICK_BMBTA
                  Extended attribute extent mappings.

           XFS_BS_SICK_BMBTC
                  Copy on Write staging extent mappings.

           XFS_BS_SICK_DIR
                  Directory information.

           XFS_BS_SICK_XATTR
                  Extended attribute data.

           XFS_BS_SICK_SYMLINK

           XFS_BS_SICK_PARENT
                  Parent pointers.

RETURN VALUE
       On error, -1 is returned, and errno is set to indicate the error.

ERRORS
       Error codes can be one of, but are not limited to, the following:

       EFAULT The kernel was not able to copy into the userspace buffer.

       EFSBADCRC
              Metadata checksum validation failed while performing the query.
