NAME
       gnutls_dtls_set_data_mtu - API function

SYNOPSIS
       #include <gnutls/dtls.h>

       int gnutls_dtls_set_data_mtu(gnutls_session_t session, unsigned int mtu);

ARGUMENTS
       gnutls_session_t session
                   is a gnutls_session_t type.

       unsigned int mtu
                   The maximum unencrypted transfer unit of the session

DESCRIPTION
       This  function  will set the maximum size of the *unencrypted* records which will be sent over a DTLS session. It is equivalent to calculating the DTLS packet overhead with the current encryption
       parameters, and calling gnutls_dtls_set_mtu() with that value. In particular, this means that you may need to call this function again after any negotiation or renegotiation, in order  to  ensure
       that the MTU is still sufficient to account for the new protocol overhead.

       In most cases you only need to call gnutls_dtls_set_mtu() with the maximum MTU of your transport layer.

RETURNS
       GNUTLS_E_SUCCESS (0) on success, or a negative error code.

SINCE
       3.1
