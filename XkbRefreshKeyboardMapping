DESCRIPTION
       XkbRefreshKeyboardMapping  is the Xkb equivalent of the core XRefreshKeyboardMapping function. It requests that the X server send the current key mapping information to this client. A client usu‐
       ally invokes XkbRefreshKeyboardMapping after receiving an XkbMapNotify event.  XkbRefreshKeyboardMapping returns Success if it succeeds and BadMatch if the event is not an Xkb event.

       The XkbMapNotify event can be generated when some client calls XkbSetMap, XkbChangeMap, XkbGetKeyboardByName, or any of the standard X library functions that change the keyboard mapping or  modi‐
       fier mapping.

RETURN VALUES

DIAGNOSTICS
