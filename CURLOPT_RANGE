NAME
       CURLOPT_RANGE - byte range to request

SYNOPSIS
       #include <curl/curl.h>

       CURLcode curl_easy_setopt(CURL *handle, CURLOPT_RANGE, char *range);

DESCRIPTION
       Pass a char * as parameter, which should contain the specified range you want to retrieve. It should be in the format "X-Y", where either X or Y may be left out and X and Y are byte indexes.

       HTTP transfers also support several intervals, separated with commas as in "X-Y,N-M". Using this kind of multiple intervals will cause the HTTP server to send the response document in pieces (us‚Äê
       ing standard MIME separation techniques). Unfortunately, the HTTP standard (RFC 7233 section 3.1) allows servers to ignore range requests so even when you set CURLOPT_RANGE(3) for a request,  you
       may end up getting the full response sent back.

       For RTSP, the formatting of a range should follow RFC2326 Section 12.29. For RTSP, byte ranges are not permitted. Instead, ranges should be given in npt, utc, or smpte formats.

       For HTTP PUT uploads this option should not be used, since it may conflict with other options.

       Pass a NULL to this option to disable the use of ranges.

       The application does not have to keep the string around after setting this option.

DEFAULT
       NULL

PROTOCOLS
       HTTP, FTP, FILE, RTSP and SFTP.

EXAMPLE
       CURL *curl = curl_easy_init();
       if(curl) {
         curl_easy_setopt(curl, CURLOPT_URL, "https://example.com");

         /* get the first 200 bytes */
         curl_easy_setopt(curl, CURLOPT_RANGE, "0-199");

         /* Perform the request */
         curl_easy_perform(curl);
       }

AVAILABILITY
       FILE since 7.18.0, RTSP since 7.20.0

RETURN VALUE
       Returns CURLE_OK on success or CURLE_OUT_OF_MEMORY if there was insufficient heap space.
