NAME
       IO::Socket::UNIX - Object interface for AF_UNIX domain sockets

SYNOPSIS
           use IO::Socket::UNIX;

           my $SOCK_PATH = "$ENV{HOME}/unix-domain-socket-test.sock";

           # Server:
           my $server = IO::Socket::UNIX->new(
               Type => SOCK_STREAM(),
               Local => $SOCK_PATH,
               Listen => 1,
           );

           my $count = 1;
           while (my $conn = $server->accept()) {
               $conn->print("Hello " . ($count++) . "\n");
           }

           # Client:
           my $client = IO::Socket::UNIX->new(
               Type => SOCK_STREAM(),
               Peer => $SOCK_PATH,
           );

           # Now read and write from $client

DESCRIPTION
       "IO::Socket::UNIX" provides an object interface to creating and using sockets in the AF_UNIX domain. It is built upon the IO::Socket interface and inherits all the methods defined by IO::Socket.

CONSTRUCTOR
       new ( [ARGS] )
           Creates an "IO::Socket::UNIX" object, which is a reference to a newly created symbol (see the "Symbol" package). "new" optionally takes arguments, these arguments are in key-value pairs.

           In addition to the key-value pairs accepted by IO::Socket, "IO::Socket::UNIX" provides.

               Type        Type of socket (eg SOCK_STREAM or SOCK_DGRAM)
               Local       Path to local fifo
               Peer        Path to peer fifo
               Listen      Queue size for listen

           If the constructor is only passed a single argument, it is assumed to be a "Peer" specification.

           If the "Listen" argument is given, but false, the queue size will be set to 5.

           If the constructor fails it will return "undef" and set the $IO::Socket::errstr package variable to contain an error message.

               $sock = IO::Socket::UNIX->new(...)
                   or die "Cannot create socket - $IO::Socket::errstr\n";

           For legacy reasons the error message is also set into the global $@ variable, and you may still find older code which looks here instead.

               $sock = IO::Socket::UNIX->new(...)
                   or die "Cannot create socket - $@\n";

METHODS
       hostpath()
           Returns the pathname to the fifo at the local end

       peerpath()
           Returns the pathanme to the fifo at the peer end
