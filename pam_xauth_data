PAM_XAUTH_DATA(3)              Linux-PAM Manual              PAM_XAUTH_DATA(3)

NAME
       pam_xauth_data - structure containing X authentication data

SYNOPSIS
       #include <security/pam_appl.h>

       struct pam_xauth_data {
           int namelen;
           char *name;
           int datalen;
           char *data;
       };

DESCRIPTION
       The pam_xauth_data structure contains X authentication data used to
       make a connection to an X display. Using this mechanism, an application
       can communicate X authentication data to PAM service modules. This
       allows modules to make a connection to the user's X display in order to
       label the user's session on login, display visual feedback or for other
       purposes.

       The name field contains the name of the authentication method, such as
       "MIT-MAGIC-COOKIE-1". The namelen field contains the length of this
       string, not including the trailing NUL character.

       The data field contains the authentication method-specific data
       corresponding to the specified name. The datalen field contains its
       length in bytes.

       The X authentication data can be changed with the PAM_XAUTH_DATA item.
       It can be queried and set with pam_get_item(3) and pam_set_item (3)
       respectively. The value used to set it should be a pointer to a
       pam_xauth_data structure. An internal copy of both the structure itself
       and its fields is made by PAM when setting the item.

SEE ALSO
       pam_start(3), pam_get_item(3),

STANDARDS
       The pam_xauth_data structure and PAM_XAUTH_DATA item are Linux-PAM
       extensions.
