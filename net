DESCRIPTION
       This tool is part of the samba(7) suite.

       The Samba net utility is meant to work just like the net utility available for windows and DOS. The first argument should be used to specify the protocol to use when executing a certain command.
       ADS is used for ActiveDirectory, RAP is using for old (Win9x/NT3) clients and RPC can be used for NT4 and Windows 2000. If this argument is omitted, net will try to determine it automatically.
       Not all commands are available on all protocols.

OPTIONS
       -w|--target-workgroup target-workgroup
           Sets target workgroup or domain. You have to specify either this option or the IP address or the name of a server.

       -d|--debuglevel=DEBUGLEVEL
           level is an integer from 0 to 10. The default value if this parameter is not specified is 1 for client applications.

           The higher this value, the more detail will be logged to the log files about the activities of the server. At level 0, only critical errors and serious warnings will be logged. Level 1 is a
           reasonable level for day-to-day running - it generates a small amount of information about operations carried out.

           Levels above 1 will generate considerable amounts of log data, and should only be used when investigating a problem. Levels above 3 are designed for use only by developers and generate HUGE
           amounts of log data, most of which is extremely cryptic.

           Note that specifying this parameter here will override the log level parameter in the /etc/samba/smb.conf file.

       --debug-stdout
           This will redirect debug output to STDOUT. By default all clients are logging to STDERR.

       --configfile=<configuration file>
           The file specified contains the configuration details required by the client. The information in this file can be general for client and server or only provide client specific like options
           such as client smb encrypt. See /etc/samba/smb.conf for more information. The default configuration file name is determined at compile time.

       --option=<name>=<value>
           Set the smb.conf(5) option "<name>" to value "<value>" from the command line. This overrides compiled-in defaults and options read from the configuration file. If a name or a value includes a
           space, wrap whole --option=name=value into quotes.

       -l|--log-basename=logdirectory
           Base directory name for log/debug files. The extension ".progname" will be appended (e.g. log.smbclient, log.smbd, etc...). The log file is never removed by the client.

       --leak-report
           Enable talloc leak reporting on exit.

       --leak-report-full
           Enable full talloc leak reporting on exit.

       -V|--version
           Prints the program version number.

       -R|--name-resolve=NAME-RESOLVE-ORDER
           This option is used to determine what naming services and in what order to resolve host names to IP addresses. The option takes a space-separated string of different name resolution options.
           The best ist to wrap the whole --name-resolve=NAME-RESOLVE-ORDER into quotes.

           The options are: "lmhosts", "host", "wins" and "bcast". They cause names to be resolved as follows:

                  •   lmhosts: Lookup an IP address in the Samba lmhosts file. If the line in lmhosts has no name type attached to the NetBIOS name (see the lmhosts(5) for details) then any name type
                      matches for lookup.

                  •   host: Do a standard host name to IP address resolution, using the system /etc/hosts, NIS, or DNS lookups. This method of name resolution is operating system dependent, for instance
                      on IRIX or Solaris this may be controlled by the /etc/nsswitch.conf file). Note that this method is only used if the NetBIOS name type being queried is the 0x20 (server) name type,
                      otherwise it is ignored.

                  •   wins: Query a name with the IP address listed in the wins server parameter. If no WINS server has been specified this method will be ignored.

                  •   bcast: Do a broadcast on each of the known local interfaces listed in the interfaces parameter. This is the least reliable of the name resolution methods as it depends on the
                      target host being on a locally connected subnet.

           If this parameter is not set then the name resolve order defined in the /etc/samba/smb.conf file parameter (name resolve order) will be used.

           The default order is lmhosts, host, wins, bcast. Without this parameter or any entry in the name resolve order parameter of the /etc/samba/smb.conf file, the name resolution methods will be
           attempted in this order.

       -O|--socket-options=SOCKETOPTIONS
           TCP socket options to set on the client socket. See the socket options parameter in the /etc/samba/smb.conf manual page for the list of valid options.

       -m|--max-protocol=MAXPROTOCOL
           The value of the parameter (a string) is the highest protocol level that will be supported by the client.

           Note that specifying this parameter here will override the client max protocol parameter in the /etc/samba/smb.conf file.

       -n|--netbiosname=NETBIOSNAME
           This option allows you to override the NetBIOS name that Samba uses for itself. This is identical to setting the netbios name parameter in the /etc/samba/smb.conf file. However, a command
           line setting will take precedence over settings in /etc/samba/smb.conf.

       --netbios-scope=SCOPE
           This specifies a NetBIOS scope that nmblookup will use to communicate with when generating NetBIOS names. For details on the use of NetBIOS scopes, see rfc1001.txt and rfc1002.txt. NetBIOS
           scopes are very rarely used, only set this parameter if you are the system administrator in charge of all the NetBIOS systems you communicate with.

       -W|--workgroup=WORKGROUP
           Set the SMB domain of the username. This overrides the default domain which is the domain defined in smb.conf. If the domain specified is the same as the servers NetBIOS name, it causes the
           client to log on using the servers local SAM (as opposed to the Domain SAM).

           Note that specifying this parameter here will override the workgroup parameter in the /etc/samba/smb.conf file.

       -r|--realm=REALM
           Set the realm for the domain.

           Note that specifying this parameter here will override the realm parameter in the /etc/samba/smb.conf file.

       -U|--user=[DOMAIN\]USERNAME[%PASSWORD]
           Sets the SMB username or username and password.

           If %PASSWORD is not specified, the user will be prompted. The client will first check the USER environment variable (which is also permitted to also contain the password separated by a %),
           then the LOGNAME variable (which is not permitted to contain a password) and if either exists, the value is used. If these environmental variables are not found, the username found in a
           Kerberos Credentials cache may be used.

           A third option is to use a credentials file which contains the plaintext of the username and password. This option is mainly provided for scripts where the admin does not wish to pass the
           credentials on the command line or via environment variables. If this method is used, make certain that the permissions on the file restrict access from unwanted users. See the -A for more
           details.

           Be cautious about including passwords in scripts or passing user-supplied values onto the command line. For security it is better to let the Samba client tool ask for the password if needed,
           or obtain the password once with kinit.

           While Samba will attempt to scrub the password from the process title (as seen in ps), this is after startup and so is subject to a race.

       -N|--no-pass
           If specified, this parameter suppresses the normal password prompt from the client to the user. This is useful when accessing a service that does not require a password.

           Unless a password is specified on the command line or this parameter is specified, the client will request a password.

           If a password is specified on the command line and this option is also defined the password on the command line will be silently ignored and no password will be used.

       --password
           Specify the password on the commandline.

           Be cautious about including passwords in scripts or passing user-supplied values onto the command line. For security it is better to let the Samba client tool ask for the password if needed,
           or obtain the password once with kinit.

           If --password is not specified, the tool will check the PASSWD environment variable, followed by PASSWD_FD which is expected to contain an open file descriptor (FD) number.

           Finally it will check PASSWD_FILE (containing a file path to be opened). The file should only contain the password. Make certain that the permissions on the file restrict access from unwanted
           users!

           While Samba will attempt to scrub the password from the process title (as seen in ps), this is after startup and so is subject to a race.

       --pw-nt-hash
           The supplied password is the NT hash.

       -A|--authentication-file=filename
           This option allows you to specify a file from which to read the username and password used in the connection. The format of the file is:

                                   username = <value>
                                   password = <value>
                                   domain   = <value>

           Make certain that the permissions on the file restrict access from unwanted users!

       -P|--machine-pass
           Use stored machine account password.

       --simple-bind-dn=DN
           DN to use for a simple bind.

       --use-kerberos=desired|required|off
           This parameter determines whether Samba client tools will try to authenticate using Kerberos. For Kerberos authentication you need to use dns names instead of IP addresses when connecting to
           a service.

           Note that specifying this parameter here will override the client use kerberos parameter in the /etc/samba/smb.conf file.

       --use-krb5-ccache=CCACHE
           Specifies the credential cache location for Kerberos authentication.

           This will set --use-kerberos=required too.

       --use-winbind-ccache
           Try to use the credential cache by winbind.

       --client-protection=sign|encrypt|off
           Sets the connection protection the client tool should use.

           Note that specifying this parameter here will override the client protection parameter in the /etc/samba/smb.conf file.

           In case you need more fine grained control you can use: --option=clientsmbencrypt=OPTION, --option=clientipcsigning=OPTION, --option=clientsigning=OPTION.

COMMANDS
   CHANGESECRETPW
       This command allows the Samba machine account password to be set from an external application to a machine account password that has already been stored in Active Directory. DO NOT USE this
       command unless you know exactly what you are doing. The use of this command requires that the force flag (-f) be used also. There will be NO command prompt. Whatever information is piped into
       stdin, either by typing at the command line or otherwise, will be stored as the literal machine password. Do NOT use this without care and attention as it will overwrite a legitimate machine
       password without warning. YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED.

   TIME
       The NET TIME command allows you to view the time on a remote server or synchronise the time on the local server with the time on the remote server.

   TIME
       Without any options, the NET TIME command displays the time on the remote server. The remote server must be specified with the -S option.

   TIME SYSTEM
       Displays the time on the remote server in a format ready for /bin/date. The remote server must be specified with the -S option.

   TIME SET
       Tries to set the date and time of the local server to that on the remote server using /bin/date. The remote server must be specified with the -S option.

   TIME ZONE
       Displays the timezone in hours from GMT on the remote server. The remote server must be specified with the -S option.

   [RPC|ADS] JOIN [TYPE] [--no-dns-updates] [-U username[%password]] [dnshostname=FQDN] [createupn=UPN] [createcomputer=OU] [machinepass=PASS] [osName=string osVer=string] [options]
       Join a domain. If the account already exists on the server, and [TYPE] is MEMBER, the machine will attempt to join automatically. (Assuming that the machine has been created in server manager)
       Otherwise, a password will be prompted for, and a new account may be created.

       [TYPE] may be PDC, BDC or MEMBER to specify the type of server joining the domain.

       [FQDN] (ADS only) set the dnsHostName attribute during the join. The default format is netbiosname.dnsdomain.

       [UPN] (ADS only) set the principalname attribute during the join. The default format is host/netbiosname@REALM.

       [OU] (ADS only) Precreate the computer account in a specific OU. The OU string reads from top to bottom without RDNs, and is delimited by a '/'. Please note that '\' is used for escape by both
       the shell and ldap, so it may need to be doubled or quadrupled to pass through, and it is not used as a delimiter.

       [PASS] (ADS only) Set a specific password on the computer account being created by the join.

       [osName=string osVer=String] (ADS only) Set the operatingSystem and operatingSystemVersion attribute during the join. Both parameters must be specified for either to take effect.

   [RPC] OLDJOIN [options]
       Join a domain. Use the OLDJOIN option to join the domain using the old style of domain joining - you need to create a trust account in server manager first.

           to the keytab file.

       Windows SPN
           A Windows SPN is of the format 'serviceclass/host:port', it is used to create a kerberos principal 'serviceclass/host@realm' which will be written to the keytab file.

       Unlike old versions no computer AD objects are modified by this command. To preserve the bevhaviour of older clients 'net ads keytab ad_update_ads' is available.

   ADS KEYTAB ADD_UPDATE_ADS (principal | machine | serviceclass | windows SPN
       Adds a new keytab entry (see section for net ads keytab add). In addition to adding entries to the keytab file corrosponding Windows SPNs are created from the entry passed to this command. These

       serviceclass
           A serviceclass (such as 'cifs', 'html' etc.) is used to create a pair of Windows SPN(s) 'param/full_qualified_dns' & 'param/netbios_name' which are added to the AD computer account object for
           this client.

       Windows SPN

           Something we failed to parse. Default action is to "edit" it in interactive and "delete" it in automatic mode.

   USERSHARE
       Starting with version 3.0.23, a Samba server now supports the ability for non-root users to add user defined shares to be exported using the "net usershare" commands.

       To set this up, first set up your /etc/samba/smb.conf by adding to the [global] section: usershare path = /usr/local/samba/lib/usershares Next create the directory
       /usr/local/samba/lib/usershares, change the owner to root and set the group owner to the UNIX group who should have the ability to create usershares, for example a group called "serverops". Set
       the permissions on /usr/local/samba/lib/usershares to 01770. (Owner and group all access, no access for others, plus the sticky bit, which means that a file in that directory can be renamed or
       deleted only by the owner of the file). Finally, tell smbd how many usershares you will allow by adding to the [global] section of /etc/samba/smb.conf a line such as : usershare max shares = 100.
       To allow 100 usershare definitions. Now, members of the UNIX group "serverops" can create user defined shares on demand using the commands below.

       The usershare commands are:
           net usershare add sharename path [comment [acl] [guest_ok=[y|n]]] - to add or change a user defined share.
           net usershare delete sharename - to delete a user defined share.
           net usershare info [--long] [wildcard sharename] - to print info about a user defined share.
           net usershare list [--long] [wildcard sharename] - to list user defined shares.

   USERSHARE ADD sharename path [comment] [acl] [guest_ok=[y|n]]
       Add or replace a new user defined share, with name "sharename".

       "path" specifies the absolute pathname on the system to be exported. Restrictions may be put on this, see the global /etc/samba/smb.conf parameters: "usershare owner only", "usershare prefix
       allow list", and "usershare prefix deny list".

       The optional "comment" parameter is the comment that will appear on the share when browsed to by a client.

       The optional "acl" field specifies which users have read and write access to the entire share. Note that guest connections are not allowed unless the /etc/samba/smb.conf parameter "usershare
       allow guests" has been set. The definition of a user defined share acl is: "user:permission", where user is a valid username on the system and permission can be "F", "R", or "D". "F" stands for
       "full permissions", ie. read and write permissions. "D" stands for "deny" for a user, ie. prevent this user from accessing this share. "R" stands for "read only", ie. only allow read access to
       this share (no creation of new files or directories or writing to files).

       The default if no "acl" is given is "Everyone:R", which means any authenticated user has read-only access.

       The optional "guest_ok" has the same effect as the parameter of the same name in /etc/samba/smb.conf, in that it allows guest access to this user defined share. This parameter is only allowed if
       the global parameter "usershare allow guests" has been set to true in the /etc/samba/smb.conf.

       There is no separate command to modify an existing user defined share, just use the "net usershare add [sharename]" command using the same sharename as the one you wish to modify and specify the
       new options you wish. The Samba smbd daemon notices user defined share modifications at connect time so will see the change immediately, there is no need to restart smbd on adding, deleting or
       changing a user defined share.

   USERSHARE DELETE sharename
       Deletes the user defined share by name. The Samba smbd daemon immediately notices this change, although it will not disconnect any users currently connected to the deleted share.

   USERSHARE INFO [--long] [wildcard sharename]
       Get info on user defined shares owned by the current user matching the given pattern, or all users.

       net usershare info on its own dumps out info on the user defined shares that were created by the current user, or restricts them to share names that match the given wildcard pattern ('*' matches
       one or more characters, '?' matches only one character). If the '--long' option is also given, it prints out info on user defined shares created by other users.

       The information given about a share looks like: [foobar] path=/home/jeremy comment=testme usershare_acl=Everyone:F guest_ok=n And is a list of the current settings of the user defined share that
       can be modified by the "net usershare add" command.

   USERSHARE LIST [--long] wildcard sharename
       List all the user defined shares owned by the current user matching the given pattern, or all users.

       net usershare list on its own list out the names of the user defined shares that were created by the current user, or restricts the list to share names that match the given wildcard pattern ('*'
       matches one or more characters, '?' matches only one character). If the '--long' option is also given, it includes the names of user defined shares created by other users.

   [RPC] CONF
       Starting with version 3.2.0, a Samba server can be configured by data stored in registry. This configuration data can be edited with the new "net conf" commands. There is also the possibility to
       configure a remote Samba server by enabling the RPC conf mode and specifying the address of the remote server.

       The deployment of this configuration data can be activated in two levels from the /etc/samba/smb.conf file: Share definitions from registry are activated by setting registry shares to “yes” in
       the [global] section and global configuration options are activated by setting include = registry in the [global] section for a mixed configuration or by setting config backend = registry in the
       [global] section for a registry-only configuration. See the smb.conf(5) manpage for details.

       The conf commands are:
           net [rpc] conf list - Dump the complete configuration in smb.conf like format.
           net [rpc] conf import - Import configuration from file in smb.conf format.
           net [rpc] conf listshares - List the registry shares.
           net [rpc] conf drop - Delete the complete configuration from registry.
           net [rpc] conf showshare - Show the definition of a registry share.
           net [rpc] conf addshare - Create a new registry share.
           net [rpc] conf delshare - Delete a registry share.
           net [rpc] conf setparm - Store a parameter.
           net [rpc] conf getparm - Retrieve the value of a parameter.
           net [rpc] conf delparm - Delete a parameter.
           net [rpc] conf getincludes - Show the includes of a share definition.
           net [rpc] conf setincludes - Set includes for a share.
           net [rpc] conf delincludes - Delete includes from a share definition.

   [RPC] CONF LIST
       Print the configuration data stored in the registry in a smb.conf-like format to standard output.

   [RPC] CONF IMPORT [--test|-T] filename [section]
       This command imports configuration from a file in smb.conf format. If a section encountered in the input file is present in registry, its contents is replaced. Sections of registry configuration
       that have no counterpart in the input file are not affected. If you want to delete these, you will have to use the "net conf drop" or "net conf delshare" commands. Optionally, a section may be
       specified to restrict the effect of the import command to that specific section. A test mode is enabled by specifying the parameter "-T" on the commandline. In test mode, no changes are made to
       the registry, and the resulting configuration is printed to standard output instead.

   [RPC] CONF LISTSHARES
       List the names of the shares defined in registry.

   [RPC] CONF DROP
       Delete the complete configuration data from registry.

   [RPC] CONF SHOWSHARE sharename
       Show the definition of the share or section specified. It is valid to specify "global" as sharename to retrieve the global configuration options from registry.

   [RPC] CONF ADDSHARE sharename path [writeable={y|N} [guest_ok={y|N} [comment]]]
       Create a new share definition in registry. The sharename and path have to be given. The share name may not be "global". Optionally, values for the very common options "writeable", "guest ok" and
       a "comment" may be specified. The same result may be obtained by a sequence of "net conf setparm" commands.

   [RPC] CONF DELSHARE sharename
       Delete a share definition from registry.

   [RPC] CONF SETPARM section parameter value
       Store a parameter in registry. The section may be global or a sharename. The section is created if it does not exist yet.

   [RPC] CONF GETPARM section parameter
       Show a parameter stored in registry.

   [RPC] CONF DELPARM section parameter
       Delete a parameter stored in registry.

   [RPC] CONF GETINCLUDES section
       Get the list of includes for the provided section (global or share).

       Note that due to the nature of the registry database and the nature of include directives, the includes need special treatment: Parameters are stored in registry by the parameter name as
       valuename, so there is only ever one instance of a parameter per share. Also, a specific order like in a text file is not guaranteed. For all real parameters, this is perfectly ok, but the
       include directive is rather a meta parameter, for which, in the smb.conf text file, the place where it is specified between the other parameters is very important. This can not be achieved by the
       simple registry smbconf data model, so there is one ordered list of includes per share, and this list is evaluated after all the parameters of the share.

       Further note that currently, only files can be included from registry configuration. In the future, there will be the ability to include configuration data from other registry keys.

   [RPC] CONF SETINCLUDES section [filename]+
       Set the list of includes for the provided section (global or share) to the given list of one or more filenames. The filenames may contain the usual smb.conf macros like %I.

   [RPC] CONF DELINCLUDES section
       Delete the list of includes from the provided section (global or share).

           This is a mechanism to check the existence or non-existence of certain keys or values specified in a precheck file before applying the import file. The import file will only be applied if the
           precheck succeeds.

           The check-file follows the normal registry file syntax with the following semantics:

                  •   <value name>=<value> checks whether the value exists and has the given value.

                  •   <value name>=- checks whether the value does not exist.

                  •   [key] checks whether the key exists.

   EVENTLOG
       Starting with version 3.4.0 net can read, dump, import and export native win32 eventlog files (usually *.evt). evt files are used by the native Windows eventviewer tools.

       The import and export of evt files can only succeed when eventlog list is used in /etc/samba/smb.conf file. See the smb.conf(5) manpage for details.

       The eventlog commands are:
           net eventlog dump - Dump a eventlog *.evt file on the screen.
           net eventlog import - Import a eventlog *.evt into the samba internal tdb based representation of eventlogs.
           net eventlog export - Export the samba internal tdb based representation of eventlogs into an eventlog *.evt file.

   EVENTLOG DUMP filename
       Prints a eventlog *.evt file to standard output.

   EVENTLOG IMPORT filename eventlog
       Imports a eventlog *.evt file defined by filename into the samba internal tdb representation of eventlog defined by eventlog.  eventlog needs to part of the eventlog list defined in
       /etc/samba/smb.conf. See the smb.conf(5) manpage for details.

   EVENTLOG EXPORT filename eventlog
       Exports the samba internal tdb representation of eventlog defined by eventlog to a eventlog *.evt file defined by filename.  eventlog needs to part of the eventlog list defined in
       /etc/samba/smb.conf. See the smb.conf(5) manpage for details.

   DOM
       Starting with version 3.2.0 Samba has support for remote join and unjoin APIs, both client and server-side. Windows supports remote join capabilities since Windows 2000.

       In order for Samba to be joined or unjoined remotely an account must be used that is either member of the Domain Admins group, a member of the local Administrators group or a user that is granted
       the SeMachineAccountPrivilege privilege.

       The client side support for remote join is implemented in the net dom commands which are:
           net dom join - Join a remote computer into a domain.
           net dom unjoin - Unjoin a remote computer from a domain.
           net dom renamecomputer - Renames a remote computer joined to a domain.

   DOM JOIN  domain=DOMAIN ou=OU account=ACCOUNT password=PASSWORD reboot
       Joins a computer into a domain. This command supports the following additional parameters:

              •   DOMAIN can be a NetBIOS domain name (also known as short domain name) or a DNS domain name for Active Directory Domains. As in Windows, it is also possible to control which Domain
                  Controller to use. This can be achieved by appending the DC name using the \ separator character. Example: MYDOM\MYDC. The DOMAIN parameter cannot be NULL.

              •   OU can be set to a RFC 1779 LDAP DN, like ou=mymachines,cn=Users,dc=example,dc=com in order to create the machine account in a non-default LDAP container. This optional parameter is
                  only supported when joining Active Directory Domains.

              •   ACCOUNT defines a domain account that will be used to join the machine to the domain. This domain account needs to have sufficient privileges to join machines.

              •   PASSWORD defines the password for the domain account defined with ACCOUNT.

              •   REBOOT is an optional parameter that can be set to reboot the remote machine after successful join to the domain.

       Note that you also need to use standard net parameters to connect and authenticate to the remote machine that you want to join. These additional parameters include: -S computer and -U user.

       Example: net dom join -S xp -U XP\\administrator%secret domain=MYDOM account=MYDOM\\administrator password=topsecret reboot.

       This example would connect to a computer named XP as the local administrator using password secret, and join the computer into a domain called MYDOM using the MYDOM domain administrator account
       and password topsecret. After successful join, the computer would reboot.

   DOM UNJOIN account=ACCOUNT password=PASSWORD reboot
       Unjoins a computer from a domain. This command supports the following additional parameters:

              •   ACCOUNT defines a domain account that will be used to unjoin the machine from the domain. This domain account needs to have sufficient privileges to unjoin machines.

              •   PASSWORD defines the password for the domain account defined with ACCOUNT.

              •   REBOOT is an optional parameter that can be set to reboot the remote machine after successful unjoin from the domain.

       Note that you also need to use standard net parameters to connect and authenticate to the remote machine that you want to unjoin. These additional parameters include: -S computer and -U user.

       Example: net dom unjoin -S xp -U XP\\administrator%secret account=MYDOM\\administrator password=topsecret reboot.

       This example would connect to a computer named XP as the local administrator using password secret, and unjoin the computer from the domain using the MYDOM domain administrator account and
       password topsecret. After successful unjoin, the computer would reboot.

   DOM RENAMECOMPUTER newname=NEWNAME account=ACCOUNT password=PASSWORD reboot
       Renames a computer that is joined to a domain. This command supports the following additional parameters:

              •   NEWNAME defines the new name of the machine in the domain.

              •   ACCOUNT defines a domain account that will be used to rename the machine in the domain. This domain account needs to have sufficient privileges to rename machines.

              •   PASSWORD defines the password for the domain account defined with ACCOUNT.

              •   REBOOT is an optional parameter that can be set to reboot the remote machine after successful rename in the domain.

       Note that you also need to use standard net parameters to connect and authenticate to the remote machine that you want to rename in the domain. These additional parameters include: -S computer
       and -U user.

       Example: net dom renamecomputer -S xp -U XP\\administrator%secret newname=XPNEW account=MYDOM\\administrator password=topsecret reboot.

       This example would connect to a computer named XP as the local administrator using password secret, and rename the joined computer to XPNEW using the MYDOM domain administrator account and
       password topsecret. After successful rename, the computer would reboot.

   G_LOCK
       Manage global locks.

   G_LOCK DO lockname timeout command
       Execute a shell command under a global lock. This might be useful to define the order in which several shell commands will be executed. The locking information is stored in a file called
       g_lock.tdb. In setups with CTDB running, the locking information will be available on all cluster nodes.

              •   LOCKNAME defines the name of the global lock.

              •   TIMEOUT defines the timeout.

              •   COMMAND defines the shell command to execute.

   G_LOCK LOCKS
       Print a list of all currently existing locknames.

   G_LOCK DUMP lockname
       Dump the locking table of a certain global lock.

   TDB
       Print information from tdb records.

   TDB LOCKING key [DUMP]
       List sharename, filename and number of share modes for a record from locking.tdb. With the optional DUMP options, dump the complete record.

              •   KEY Key of the tdb record as hex string.

   vfs
       Access shared filesystem through the VFS.

   vfs stream2abouble [--recursive] [--verbose] [--continue] [--follow-symlinks] share path
       Convert file streams to AppleDouble files.

              •   share A Samba share.

              •   path A relative path of something in the Samba share. "." can be used for the root directory of the share.

       Options:

       --recursive
           Traverse a directory hierarchy.

       --verbose
           Verbose output.

       --continue
           Continue traversing a directory hierarchy if a single conversion fails.

       --follow-symlinks
           Follow symlinks encountered while traversing a directory.

   vfs getntacl share path
       Display the security descriptor of a file or directory.

              •   share A Samba share.

              •   path A relative path of something in the Samba share. "." can be used for the root directory of the share.

   OFFLINEJOIN
       Starting with version 4.15 Samba has support for offline join APIs. Windows supports offline join capabilities since Windows 7 and Windows 2008 R2.

       The following offline commands are implemented:
           net offlinejoin provision - Provisions a machine account in AD.
           net offlinejoin requestodj - Requests a domain offline join.

   OFFLINEJOIN PROVISION domain=DOMAIN machine_name=MACHINE_NAME machine_account_ou=MACHINE_ACCOUNT_OU dcname=DCNAME defpwd reuse savefile=FILENAME printblob
       Provisions a machine account in AD. This command needs network connectivity to the domain controller to succeed. This command supports the following additional parameters:

              •   DOMAIN can be a NetBIOS domain name (also known as short domain name) or a DNS domain name for Active Directory Domains. The DOMAIN parameter cannot be NULL.

              •   MACHINE_NAME defines the machine account name that will be provisioned in AD. The MACHINE_NAME parameter cannot be NULL.

              •   MACHINE_ACCOUNT_OU can be set to a RFC 1779 LDAP DN, like ou=mymachines,cn=Users,dc=example,dc=com in order to create the machine account in a non-default LDAP container. This optional
                  parameter is only supported when joining Active Directory Domains.

              •   DCNAME defines a specific domain controller for creating the machine account in AD.

              •   DEFPWD is an optional parameter that can be set to enforce using the default machine account password. The use of this parameter is not recommended as the default machine account
                  password can be easily guessed.

              •   REUSE is an optional parameter that can be set to enforce reusing an existing machine account in AD.

              •   SAVEFILE is an optional parameter to store the generated provisioning data on disk.

              •   PRINTBLOB is an optional parameter to print the generated provisioning data on stdout.

       Example: net offlinejoin provision -U administrator%secret domain=MYDOM machine_name=MYHOST savefile=provisioning.txt

   OFFLINEJOIN REQUESTODJ loadfile=FILENAME
       Requests an offline domain join by providing file-based provisioning data. This command supports the following additional parameters:

              •   LOADFILE is a required parameter to load the provisioning from a file.

       Example: net offlinejoin requestodj -U administrator%secret loadfile=provisioning.txt

   HELP [COMMAND]
       Gives usage information for the specified command.
