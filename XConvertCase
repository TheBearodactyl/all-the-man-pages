NAME
       XStringToKeysym, XKeysymToString, XKeycodeToKeysym, XKeysymToKeycode, XConvertCase - convert keysyms

SYNTAX
       KeySym XStringToKeysym(_Xconst char *string);

       char *XKeysymToString(KeySym keysym);

       KeySym XKeycodeToKeysym(Display *display, KeyCode keycode, int index);

       KeyCode XKeysymToKeycode(Display *display, KeySym keysym);

       void XConvertCase(KeySym keysym, KeySym *lower_return, KeySym *upper_return);

ARGUMENTS
       display   Specifies the connection to the X server.

       index     Specifies the element of KeyCode vector.

       keycode   Specifies the KeyCode.

       keysym    Specifies the KeySym that is to be searched for or converted.

       lower_return
                 Returns the lowercase form of keysym, or keysym.

       string    Specifies the name of the KeySym that is to be converted.

       upper_return
                 Returns the uppercase form of keysym, or keysym.

DESCRIPTION
       Standard  KeySym  names  are obtained from X11/keysymdef.h by removing the XK_ prefix from each name.  KeySyms that are not part of the Xlib standard also may be obtained with this function.  The
       set of KeySyms that are available in this manner and the mechanisms by which Xlib obtains them is implementation-dependent.

       If the KeySym name is not in the Host Portable Character Encoding, the result is implementation-dependent.  If the specified string does not match a valid KeySym, XStringToKeysym  returns  NoSym‚Äê
       bol.

       The returned string is in a static area and must not be modified.  The returned string is in the Host Portable Character Encoding.  If the specified KeySym is not defined, XKeysymToString returns
       a NULL.

       The XKeycodeToKeysym function uses internal Xlib tables and returns the KeySym defined for the specified KeyCode and the element of the KeyCode vector.  If no symbol is defined,  XKeycodeToKeysym
       returns NoSymbol.  XKeycodeToKeysym predates the XKB extension.  If you want to lookup a KeySym while using XKB you have to use XkbKeycodeToKeysym.

       If the specified KeySym is not defined for any KeyCode, XKeysymToKeycode returns zero.

       The  XConvertCase  function  returns  the  uppercase  and lowercase forms of the specified Keysym, if the KeySym is subject to case conversion; otherwise, the specified KeySym is returned to both
       lower_return and upper_return.  Support for conversion of other than Latin and Cyrillic KeySyms is implementation-dependent.
