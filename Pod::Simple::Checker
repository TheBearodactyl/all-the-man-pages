Pod::Simple::Checker(3pPerl Programmers Reference GPod::Simple::Checker(3perl)

NAME
       Pod::Simple::Checker -- check the Pod syntax of a document

SYNOPSIS
         perl -MPod::Simple::Checker -e \
          "exit Pod::Simple::Checker->filter(shift)->any_errata_seen" \
          thingy.pod

DESCRIPTION
       This class is for checking the syntactic validity of Pod.  It works by
       basically acting like a simple-minded version of Pod::Simple::Text that
       formats only the "Pod Errors" section (if Pod::Simple even generates
       one for the given document).

       This is a subclass of Pod::Simple and inherits all its methods.
