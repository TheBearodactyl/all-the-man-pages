NAME
       dane_verify_crt_raw - API function

SYNOPSIS
       #include <gnutls/dane.h>

       int dane_verify_crt_raw(dane_state_t s, const gnutls_datum_t * chain, unsigned chain_size, gnutls_certificate_type_t chain_type, dane_query_t r, unsigned int sflags, unsigned int vflags, unsigned
       int * verify);

ARGUMENTS
       dane_state_t s
                   A DANE state structure (may be NULL)

       const gnutls_datum_t * chain
                   A certificate chain

       unsigned chain_size
                   The size of the chain

       gnutls_certificate_type_t chain_type
                   The type of the certificate chain

       dane_query_t r
                   DANE data to check against

       unsigned int sflags
                   Flags for the initialization of  s (if NULL)

       unsigned int vflags
                   Verification flags; an OR'ed list of dane_verify_flags_t.

       unsigned int * verify
                   An OR'ed list of dane_verify_status_t.

DESCRIPTION
       This is the low-level function of dane_verify_crt(). See the high level function for documentation.

       This function does not perform any resolving, it utilizes cached entries from  r .

RETURNS
       a negative error code on error and DANE_E_SUCCESS (0) when the DANE entries were successfully parsed, irrespective of whether they were verified (see  verify for that information). If  no  usable
       entries were encountered DANE_E_REQUESTED_DATA_NOT_AVAILABLE will be returned.
