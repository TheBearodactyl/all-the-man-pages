NAME
       gnutls_x509_rdn_get - API function

SYNOPSIS
       #include <gnutls/x509.h>

       int gnutls_x509_rdn_get(const gnutls_datum_t * idn, char * buf, size_t * buf_size);

ARGUMENTS
       const gnutls_datum_t * idn
                   should contain a DER encoded RDN sequence

       char * buf  a pointer to a structure to hold the peer's name

       size_t * buf_size
                   holds the size of  buf

DESCRIPTION
       This function will return the name of the given RDN sequence.  The name will be in the form "C=xxxx,O=yyyy,CN=zzzz" as described in RFC4514.

       This function does not output a fully RFC4514 compliant string, if that is required see gnutls_x509_rdn_get2().

RETURNS
       On success, GNUTLS_E_SUCCESS (0) is returned, or GNUTLS_E_SHORT_MEMORY_BUFFER is returned and * buf_size is updated if the provided buffer is not long enough, otherwise a negative error value.
