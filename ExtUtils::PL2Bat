NAME
       ExtUtils::PL2Bat - Batch file creation to run perl scripts on Windows

VERSION
       version 0.004

OVERVIEW
       This module converts a perl script into a batch file that can be executed on Windows/DOS-like operating systems.  This is intended to allow you to use a Perl script like regular programs and
       batch files where you just enter the name of the script [probably minus the extension] plus any command-line arguments and the script is found in your PATH and run.

FUNCTIONS
   pl2bat(%opts)
       This function takes a perl script and write a batch file that contains the script. This is sometimes necessary

       •       "in"

               The name of the script that is to be batchified. This argument is mandatory.

       •       "out"

               The name of the output batch file. If not given, it will be generated using "in" and "stripsuffix".

       •       "ntargs"

               Arguments to invoke perl with in generated batch file when run from Windows NT.  Defaults to '-x -S %0 %*'.

       •       "otherargs"

               Arguments to invoke perl with in generated batch file except when run from Windows NT (ie. when run from DOS, Windows 3.1, or Windows 95).  Defaults to
               '-x -S "%0" %1 %2 %3 %4 %5 %6 %7 %8 %9'.

       •       "stripsuffix"

               Strip a suffix string from file name before appending a ".bat" suffix.  The suffix is not case-sensitive.  It can be a regex or a string and a trailing "$" is always assumed).  Defaults
               to "qr/\.plx?/".

       •       "usewarnings"

               With the "usewarnings" option, " -w" is added after the value of $Config{startperl}.  If a line matching "/^#!.*perl/" already exists in the script, then it is not changed and the -w
               option is ignored.

       •       "update"

               If the script appears to have already been processed by pl2bat, then the script is skipped and not processed unless "update" was specified.  If "update" is specified, the existing
               preamble is replaced.

ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS
       This code was taken from Module::Build and then modified; which had taken it from perl's pl2bat script. This module is an attempt at unifying all three implementations.
