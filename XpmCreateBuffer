DESCRIPTION
   XpmCreateBufferFromPixmap
       XpmCreateBufferFromPixmap()  creates an XPM buffer from a Pixmap.  The XpmCreateBufferFromPixmap() function works as XpmWriteFileFromPixmap(3), it just calls XpmCreateBufferFromImage() instead of
       XpmWriteFileFromImage(3).  Once again, the caller should free the buffer using XpmFree(3) when finished.

       As a convenience, the XpmReadFileToBuffer(3) and XpmWriteFileFromBuffer(3) functions are provided to copy a file to a buffer and to write a file from a buffer. Thus for instance one may decide to
       use  XpmCreateBufferFromPixmap(), XpmWriteFileFromBuffer(3), and XpmFree(3) instead of XpmWriteFileFromPixmap(3).  On some systems this may lead to a performance improvement, since the processing
       will be performed in memory, but it uses more memory.

   XpmCreateBufferFromImage
       The XpmCreateBufferFromImage() function works as XpmWriteFileFromImage(3), it just writes to a malloc’ed buffer instead of to a file.  The caller should free the buffer using XpmFree(3) when fin‐
       ished.

   XpmCreateBufferFromXpmImage.
       To  create an XPM buffer from an XpmImage, use XpmCreateBufferFromXpmImage().  The XpmCreateBufferFromXpmImage() function writes out the given image to a single block malloc’ed buffer in XPM for‐
       mat.  If insufficient working storage is allocated, it returns XpmNoMemory, and returns XpmSuccess on success.  If the passed XpmInfo structure pointer is not NULL,  XpmCreateBufferFromXpmImage()
       looks for the following attributes: XpmComments, XpmExtensions, and XpmHotspot, and writes the related information out as well.  The caller should free the buffer using XpmFree(3) when finished.
