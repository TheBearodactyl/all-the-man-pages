NAME
       Test2::EventFacet::Control - Facet for hub actions and behaviors.

DESCRIPTION
       This facet is used when the event needs to give instructions to the Test2 internals.

FIELDS
       $string = $control->{details}
       $string = $control->details()
           Human readable explanation for the special behavior.

       $bool = $control->{global}
       $bool = $control->global()
           True if the event is global in nature and should be seen by all hubs.

       $exit = $control->{terminate}
       $exit = $control->terminate()
           Defined if the test should immediately exit, the value is the exit code and may be 0.

       $bool = $control->{halt}
       $bool = $control->halt()
           True if all testing should be halted immediately.

       $bool = $control->{has_callback}
       $bool = $control->has_callback()
           True if the "callback($hub)" method on the event should be called.

       $encoding = $control->{encoding}
       $encoding = $control->encoding()
           This can be used to change the encoding from this event onward.

       $phase = $control->{phase}
       $phase = $control->phase()
           Used to signal that a phase change has occurred. Currently only the perl END phase is signaled.
