NAME
       cmp - compare two files byte by byte

SYNOPSIS
       cmp [OPTION]... FILE1 [FILE2 [SKIP1 [SKIP2]]]

DESCRIPTION
       Compare two files byte by byte.

       The optional SKIP1 and SKIP2 specify the number of bytes to skip at the beginning of each file (zero by default).

       Mandatory arguments to long options are mandatory for short options too.

       -b, --print-bytes
              print differing bytes

       -i, --ignore-initial=SKIP
              skip first SKIP bytes of both inputs

       -i, --ignore-initial=SKIP1:SKIP2
              skip first SKIP1 bytes of FILE1 and first SKIP2 bytes of FILE2

       -l, --verbose
              output byte numbers and differing byte values

       -n, --bytes=LIMIT
              compare at most LIMIT bytes

       -s, --quiet, --silent
              suppress all normal output

       --help display this help and exit

       -v, --version
              output version information and exit

       SKIP values may be followed by the following multiplicative suffixes: kB 1000, K 1024, MB 1,000,000, M 1,048,576, GB 1,000,000,000, G 1,073,741,824, and so on for T, P, E, Z, Y.

       If a FILE is '-' or missing, read standard input.  Exit status is 0 if inputs are the same, 1 if different, 2 if trouble.

HISTORY
       Initially, the manual page entry for the "openssl cmd" command used to be available at cmd(1). Later, the alias openssl-cmd(1) was introduced, which made it easier to group the openssl commands
       using the apropos(1) command or the shell's tab completion.

       In order to reduce cluttering of the global manual page namespace, the manual page entries without the 'openssl-' prefix have been deprecated in OpenSSL 3.0 and will be removed in OpenSSL 4.0.

NAME
       cmp — compare two files

SYNOPSIS
       cmp [-l|-s] file1 file2

DESCRIPTION
       The cmp utility shall compare two files. The cmp utility shall write no output if the files are the same. Under default options, if they differ, it shall write to standard  output  the  byte  and
       line number at which the first difference occurred. Bytes and lines shall be numbered beginning with 1.

OPTIONS
       The cmp utility shall conform to the Base Definitions volume of POSIX.1‐2017, Section 12.2, Utility Syntax Guidelines.

       The following options shall be supported:

       -l        (Lowercase ell.) Write the byte number (decimal) and the differing bytes (octal) for each difference.

       -s        Write  nothing  to  standard output or standard error when files differ; indicate differing files through exit status only.  It is unspecified whether a diagnostic message is written to
                 standard error when an error is encountered; if a message is not written, the error is indicated through exit status only.

OPERANDS
       The following operands shall be supported:

       file1     A pathname of the first file to be compared. If file1 is '-', the standard input shall be used.

       file2     A pathname of the second file to be compared. If file2 is '-', the standard input shall be used.

       If both file1 and file2 refer to standard input or refer to the same FIFO special, block special, or character special file, the results are undefined.

STDIN
       The standard input shall be used only if the file1 or file2 operand refers to standard input. See the INPUT FILES section.

INPUT FILES
       The input files can be any file type.

ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
       The following environment variables shall affect the execution of cmp:

       LANG      Provide a default value for the internationalization variables that are unset or null. (See the Base Definitions volume of POSIX.1‐2017, Section 8.2, Internationalization Variables  for
                 the precedence of internationalization variables used to determine the values of locale categories.)

       LC_ALL    If set to a non-empty string value, override the values of all the other internationalization variables.

       LC_CTYPE  Determine the locale for the interpretation of sequences of bytes of text data as characters (for example, single-byte as opposed to multi-byte characters in arguments).

       LC_MESSAGES
                 Determine the locale that should be used to affect the format and contents of diagnostic messages written to standard error and informative messages written to standard output.

       NLSPATH   Determine the location of message catalogs for the processing of LC_MESSAGES.

ASYNCHRONOUS EVENTS
       Default.

STDOUT
       In the POSIX locale, results of the comparison shall be written to standard output. When no options are used, the format shall be:

           "%s %s differ: char %d, line %d\n", file1, file2,
               <byte number>, <line number>

       When the -l option is used, the format shall be:

           "%d %o %o\n", <byte number>, <differing byte>,
               <differing byte>

       for each byte that differs. The first <differing byte> number is from file1 while the second is from file2.  In both cases, <byte number> shall be relative to the beginning of the file, beginning
       with 1.

       No output shall be written to standard output when the -s option is used.

STDERR
       The standard error shall be used only for diagnostic messages. If the -l option is used and file1 and file2 differ in length, or if the -s option is not used and file1 and file2 are identical for
       the entire length of the shorter file, in the POSIX locale the following diagnostic message shall be written:

           "cmp: EOF on %s%s\n", <name of shorter file>, <additional info>

       The <additional info> field shall either be null or a string that starts with a <blank> and contains no <newline> characters. Some implementations report on the number of lines in this case.

       If the -s option is used and an error occurs, it is unspecified whether a diagnostic message is written to standard error.

OUTPUT FILES
       None.

EXTENDED DESCRIPTION
       None.

EXIT STATUS
       The following exit values shall be returned:

        0    The files are identical.

        1    The files are different; this includes the case where one file is identical to the first part of the other.

       >1    An error occurred.

CONSEQUENCES OF ERRORS
       Default.

       The following sections are informative.

APPLICATION USAGE
       Although  input  files  to cmp can be any type, the results might not be what would be expected on character special device files or on file types not described by the System Interfaces volume of
       POSIX.1‐2017. Since this volume of POSIX.1‐2017 does not specify the block size used when doing input, comparisons of character special files need not compare all of the data in those files.

       For files which are not text files, line numbers simply reflect the presence of a <newline>, without any implication that the file is organized into lines.

       Since the behavior of -s differs between implementations as to whether error messages are written, the only way to ensure consistent behavior of cmp when -s is used is to redirect standard  error
       to /dev/null.

       If  error messages are wanted, instead of using -s standard output should be redirected to /dev/null, and anything written to standard error should be discarded if the exit status is 1. For exam‐
       ple:

           silent_cmp() {
               # compare files with no output except error messages
               message=$(cmp "$@" 2>&1 >/dev/null)
               status=$?
               case $status in
               (0|1) ;;
               (*) printf '%s\n' "$message" ;;
               esac
               return $status
           }

EXAMPLES
       None.

RATIONALE
       The global language in Section 1.4, Utility Description Defaults indicates that using two mutually-exclusive options together produces unspecified results. Some System V implementations  consider
       the option usage:

           cmp -l -s ...

       to be an error. They also treat:

           cmp -s -l ...

       as if no options were specified. Both of these behaviors are considered bugs, but are allowed.

       The  word  char  in the standard output format comes from historical usage, even though it is actually a byte number. When cmp is supported in other locales, implementations are encouraged to use
       the word byte or its equivalent in another language. Users should not interpret this difference to indicate that the functionality of the utility changed between locales.

       Some implementations report on the number of lines in the identical-but-shorter file case. This is allowed by the inclusion of the <additional info> fields in the output format.  The  restriction
       on  having  a leading <blank> and no <newline> characters is to make parsing for the filename easier. It is recognized that some filenames containing white-space characters make parsing difficult
       anyway, but the restriction does aid programs used on systems where the names are predominantly well behaved.

FUTURE DIRECTIONS
       Future versions of this standard may require that diagnostic messages are written to standard error when the -s option is specified.
