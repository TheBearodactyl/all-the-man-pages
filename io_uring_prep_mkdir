NAME
       io_uring_prep_mkdirat - prepare an mkdirat request

SYNOPSIS
       #include <fcntl.h>
       #include <sys/stat.h>
       #include <liburing.h>

       void io_uring_prep_mkdirat(struct io_uring_sqe *sqe,
                                  int dirfd,
                                  const char *path,
                                  mode_t mode);

       void io_uring_prep_mkdir(struct io_uring_sqe *sqe,
                                const char *path,
                                mode_t mode);

DESCRIPTION
       The  io_uring_prep_mkdirat(3) function prepares a mkdirat request. The submission queue entry sqe is setup to use the directory file descriptor pointed to by dirfd to start a mkdirat operation on
       the path identified by path with the mode given in mode.

       The io_uring_prep_mkdir(3) function prepares a mkdir request. The submission queue entry sqe is setup to use the current working directory to start a mkdir operation on  the  path  identified  by
       path with the mode given in mode.

       These functions prepare an async mkdir(2) or mkdirat(2) request. See those man pages for details.

RETURN VALUE
       None

ERRORS
       The CQE res field will contain the result of the operation. See the related man page for details on possible values. Note that where synchronous system calls will return -1 on failure and set er‐
       rno to the actual error value, io_uring never uses errno.  Instead it returns the negated errno directly in the CQE res field.

NOTES
       As with any request that passes in data in a struct, that data must remain valid until the request has been successfully submitted. It need not remain valid until completion. Once a  request  has
       been  submitted, the in-kernel state is stable. Very early kernels (5.4 and earlier) required state to be stable until the completion occurred. Applications can test for this behavior by inspect‐
       ing the IORING_FEAT_SUBMIT_STABLE flag passed back from io_uring_queue_init_params(3).
