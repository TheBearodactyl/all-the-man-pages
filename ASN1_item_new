ASN1_ITEM_NEW(3ssl)                                                                               OpenSSL                                                                              ASN1_ITEM_NEW(3ssl)

NAME
       ASN1_item_new_ex, ASN1_item_new - create new ASN.1 values

SYNOPSIS
        #include <openssl/asn1.h>

        ASN1_VALUE *ASN1_item_new_ex(const ASN1_ITEM *it, OSSL_LIB_CTX *libctx,
                                     const char *propq);
        ASN1_VALUE *ASN1_item_new(const ASN1_ITEM *it);

DESCRIPTION
       ASN1_item_new_ex() creates a new ASN1_VALUE structure based on the ASN1_ITEM template given in the it parameter. If any algorithm fetches are required during the process then they will use the
       OSSL_LIB_CTX provided in the libctx parameter and the property query string in propq. See "ALGORITHM FETCHING" in crypto(7) for more information about algorithm fetching.

       ASN1_item_new() is the same as ASN1_item_new_ex() except that the default OSSL_LIB_CTX is used (i.e. NULL) and with a NULL property query string.

RETURN VALUES
       ASN1_item_new_ex() and ASN1_item_new() return a pointer to the newly created ASN1_VALUE or NULL on error.

HISTORY
       The function ASN1_item_new_ex() was added in OpenSSL 3.0.
