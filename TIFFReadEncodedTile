NAME
       TIFFReadEncodedTile - read and decode a tile of data from an open TIFF file

SYNOPSIS
          #include <tiffio.h>

       int TIFFReadEncodedTile(TIFF *tif, ttile_t tile, tdata_t buf, tsize_t size)

DESCRIPTION
       Read the specified tile of data and place up to size bytes of decompressed information in the (user supplied) data buffer.

NOTES
       The  value  of tile is a “raw tile number”. That is, the caller must take into account whether or not the data are organized in separate planes (PlanarConfiguration = 2).  TIFFComputeTile() auto‐
       matically does this when converting an (x,y,z,sample) coordinate quadruple to a tile number. To read a full tile of data the data buffer should be at least as  large  as  the  value  returned  by
       TIFFTileSize().

       The library attempts to hide bit- and byte-ordering differences between the image and the native machine by converting data to the native machine order.  Bit reversal is done if the FillOrder tag
       is opposite to the native machine bit order. 16- and 32-bit samples are automatically byte-swapped if the file was written with a byte order opposite to the native machine byte order.

RETURN VALUES
       The actual number of bytes of data that were placed in buf is returned; TIFFReadEncodedTile() returns -1 if an error was encountered.

DIAGNOSTICS
       All error messages are directed to the TIFFErrorExtR() routine.
