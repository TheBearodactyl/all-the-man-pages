SHADOW(3)                        Library Calls                       SHADOW(3)

NAME
       shadow, getspnam - encrypted password file routines

SYNTAX
       #include <shadow.h>

       struct spwd *getspent();

       struct spwd *getspnam(char *name);

       void setspent();

       void endspent();

       struct spwd *fgetspent(FILE *fp);

       struct spwd *sgetspent(char *cp);

       int putspent(struct spwd *p, FILE *fp);

       int lckpwdf();

       int ulckpwdf();

DESCRIPTION
       shadow manipulates the contents of the shadow password file,
       /etc/shadow. The structure in the #include file is:

           struct spwd {
                 char          *sp_namp; /* user login name */
                 char          *sp_pwdp; /* encrypted password */
                 long int      sp_lstchg; /* last password change */
                 long int      sp_min; /* days until change allowed. */
                 long int      sp_max; /* days before change required */
                 long int      sp_warn; /* days warning for expiration */
                 long int      sp_inact; /* days before account inactive */
                 long int      sp_expire; /* date when account expires */
                 unsigned long int  sp_flag; /* reserved for future use */
           }

       The meanings of each field are:

       •   sp_namp - pointer to null-terminated user name

       •   sp_pwdp - pointer to null-terminated password

       •   sp_lstchg - days since Jan 1, 1970 password was last changed

       •   sp_min - days before which password may not be changed

       •   sp_max - days after which password must be changed

       •   sp_warn - days before password is to expire that user is warned of
           pending password expiration

       •   sp_inact - days after password expires that account is considered
           inactive and disabled

       •   sp_expire - days since Jan 1, 1970 when account will be disabled

       •   sp_flag - reserved for future use

DESCRIPTION
       getspent, getspname, fgetspent, and sgetspent each return a pointer to
       a struct spwd.  getspent returns the next entry from the file, and
       fgetspent returns the next entry from the given stream, which is
       assumed to be a file of the proper format.  sgetspent returns a pointer
       to a struct spwd using the provided string as input.  getspnam searches
       from the current position in the file for an entry matching name.

       setspent and endspent may be used to begin and end, respectively,
       access to the shadow password file.

       The lckpwdf and ulckpwdf routines should be used to insure exclusive
       access to the /etc/shadow file.  lckpwdf attempts to acquire a lock
       using pw_lock for up to 15 seconds. It continues by attempting to
       acquire a second lock using spw_lock for the remainder of the initial
       15 seconds. Should either attempt fail after a total of 15 seconds,
       lckpwdf returns -1. When both locks are acquired 0 is returned.

DIAGNOSTICS
       Routines return NULL if no more entries are available or if an error
       occurs during processing. Routines which have int as the return value
       return 0 for success and -1 for failure.

CAVEATS
       These routines may only be used by the superuser as access to the
       shadow password file is restricted.

FILES
       /etc/shadow
           Secure user account information.

NAME
       shadow - shadowed password file

DESCRIPTION
       shadow is a file which contains the password information for the
       system's accounts and optional aging information.

       This file must not be readable by regular users if password security is
       to be maintained.

       Each line of this file contains 9 fields, separated by colons (“:”), in
       the following order:

       login name
           It must be a valid account name, which exist on the system.

       encrypted password
           This field may be empty, in which case no passwords are required to
           authenticate as the specified login name. However, some
           applications which read the /etc/shadow file may decide not to
           permit any access at all if the password field is empty.

           A password field which starts with an exclamation mark means that
           the password is locked. The remaining characters on the line
           represent the password field before the password was locked.

           Refer to crypt(3) for details on how this string is interpreted.

           If the password field contains some string that is not a valid
           result of crypt(3), for instance ! or *, the user will not be able
           to use a unix password to log in (but the user may log in the
           system by other means).

       date of last password change
           The date of the last password change, expressed as the number of
           days since Jan 1, 1970 00:00 UTC.

           The value 0 has a special meaning, which is that the user should
           change her password the next time she will log in the system.

           An empty field means that password aging features are disabled.

       minimum password age
           The minimum password age is the number of days the user will have
           to wait before she will be allowed to change her password again.

           An empty field and value 0 mean that there is no minimum password
           age.

       maximum password age
           The maximum password age is the number of days after which the user
           will have to change her password.

           After this number of days is elapsed, the password may still be
           valid. The user should be asked to change her password the next
           time she will log in.

           An empty field means that there are no maximum password age, no
           password warning period, and no password inactivity period (see
           below).

           If the maximum password age is lower than the minimum password age,
           the user cannot change her password.

       password warning period
           The number of days before a password is going to expire (see the
           maximum password age above) during which the user should be warned.

           An empty field and value 0 mean that there are no password warning
           period.

       password inactivity period
           The number of days after a password has expired (see the maximum
           password age above) during which the password should still be
           accepted (and the user should update her password during the next
           login).

           After expiration of the password and this expiration period is
           elapsed, no login is possible for the user. The user should contact
           her administrator.

           An empty field means that there are no enforcement of an inactivity
           period.

       account expiration date
           The date of expiration of the account, expressed as the number of
           days since Jan 1, 1970 00:00 UTC.

           Note that an account expiration differs from a password expiration.
           In case of an account expiration, the user shall not be allowed to
           login. In case of a password expiration, the user is not allowed to
           login using her password.

           An empty field means that the account will never expire.

           The value 0 should not be used as it is interpreted as either an
           account with no expiration, or as an expiration on Jan 1, 1970.

       reserved field
           This field is reserved for future use.

FILES
       /etc/passwd
           User account information.

       /etc/shadow
           Secure user account information.

       /etc/shadow-
           Backup file for /etc/shadow.

           Note that this file is used by the tools of the shadow toolsuite,
           but not by all user and password management tools.
