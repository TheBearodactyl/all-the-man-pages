PROLOG
       This  manual  page is part of the POSIX Programmer's Manual.  The Linux
       implementation of this interface may differ (consult the  corresponding
       Linux  manual page for details of Linux behavior), or the interface may
       not be implemented on Linux.

NAME
       posix_trace_eventtypelist_getnext_id,  posix_trace_eventtypelist_rewind
       — iterate over a mapping of trace event types (TRACING)

SYNOPSIS
       #include <trace.h>

       int posix_trace_eventtypelist_getnext_id(trace_id_t trid,
           trace_event_id_t *restrict event, int *restrict unavailable);
       int posix_trace_eventtypelist_rewind(trace_id_t trid);

DESCRIPTION
       The  first  time  posix_trace_eventtypelist_getnext_id() is called, the
       function shall return in the variable pointed to  by  event  the  first
       trace  event  type  identifier of the list of trace events of the trace
       stream  identified  by  the  trid   argument.   Successive   calls   to
       posix_trace_eventtypelist_getnext_id()  return  in the variable pointed
       to by event the next trace event type identifier  in  that  same  list.
       Each  time  a  trace event type identifier is successfully written into
       the variable pointed to by the event argument, the variable pointed  to
       by  the  unavailable  argument shall be set to zero. When no more trace
       event type identifiers are available, and  so  none  is  returned,  the
       variable pointed to by the unavailable argument shall be set to a value
       different from zero.

       The posix_trace_eventtypelist_rewind() function shall  reset  the  next
       trace  event  type  identifier to be read to the first trace event type
       identifier from the list of trace events used in the trace stream iden‐
       tified by trid.

RETURN VALUE
       Upon  successful  completion,  these  functions shall return a value of
       zero. Otherwise, they shall return the corresponding error number.

       The posix_trace_eventtypelist_getnext_id() function  stores  the  trace
       event  type identifier value in the object pointed to by event, if suc‐
       cessful.

ERRORS
       These functions shall fail if:

       EINVAL The trid argument was not a valid trace stream identifier.

       The following sections are informative.

EXAMPLES
       None.

APPLICATION USAGE
       None.

RATIONALE
       None.

FUTURE DIRECTIONS
       The posix_trace_eventtypelist_getnext_id()  and  posix_trace_eventtype‐
       list_rewind() functions may be removed in a future version.
