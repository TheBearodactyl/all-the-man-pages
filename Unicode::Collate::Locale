NAME
       Unicode::Collate::Locale - Linguistic tailoring for DUCET via Unicode::Collate

SYNOPSIS
         use Unicode::Collate::Locale;

         #construct
         $Collator = Unicode::Collate::Locale->
             new(locale => $locale_name, %tailoring);

         #sort
         @sorted = $Collator->sort(@not_sorted);

         #compare
         $result = $Collator->cmp($a, $b); # returns 1, 0, or -1.

       Note: Strings in @not_sorted, $a and $b are interpreted according to Perl's Unicode support. See perlunicode, perluniintro, perlunitut, perlunifaq, utf8.  Otherwise you can use "preprocess" (cf.
       "Unicode::Collate") or should decode them before.

DESCRIPTION
       This module provides linguistic tailoring for it taking advantage of "Unicode::Collate".

   Constructor
       The "new" method returns a collator object.

       A parameter list for the constructor is a hash, which can include a special key "locale" and its value (case-insensitive) standing for a Unicode base language code (two or three-letter).  For
       example, "Unicode::Collate::Locale->new(locale => 'ES')" returns a collator tailored for Spanish.

       $locale_name may be suffixed with a Unicode script code (four-letter), a Unicode region (territory) code, a Unicode language variant code.  These codes are case-insensitive, and separated with
       '_' or '-'.  E.g. "en_US" for English in USA, "az_Cyrl" for Azerbaijani in the Cyrillic script, "es_ES_traditional" for Spanish in Spain (Traditional).

       If $locale_name is not available, fallback is selected in the following order:

           1. language with a variant code
           2. language with a script code
           3. language with a region code
           4. language
           5. default

       Tailoring tags provided by "Unicode::Collate" are allowed as long as they are not used for "locale" support.  Esp. the "table" tag is always untailorable, since it is reserved for DUCET.

       However "entry" is allowed, even if it is used for "locale" support, to add or override mappings.

       E.g. a collator for Spanish, which ignores diacritics and case difference (i.e. level 1), with reversed case ordering and no normalization.

           Unicode::Collate::Locale->new(
               level => 1,
               locale => 'es',
               upper_before_lower => 1,
               normalization => undef
           )

       Overriding a behavior already tailored by "locale" is disallowed if such a tailoring is passed to "new()".

           Unicode::Collate::Locale->new(
               locale => 'da',
               upper_before_lower => 0, # causes error as reserved by 'da'
           )

       However "change()" inherited from "Unicode::Collate" allows such a tailoring that is reserved by "locale". Examples:

           new(locale => 'fr_ca')->change(backwards => undef)
           new(locale => 'da')->change(upper_before_lower => 0)
           new(locale => 'ja')->change(overrideCJK => undef)

   Methods
       "Unicode::Collate::Locale" is a subclass of "Unicode::Collate" and methods other than "new" are inherited from "Unicode::Collate".

       Here is a list of additional methods:

       "$Collator->getlocale"
           Returns a language code accepted and used actually on collation.  If linguistic tailoring is not provided for a language code you passed (intensionally for some languages, or due to the
           incomplete implementation), this method returns a string 'default' meaning no special tailoring.

       "$Collator->locale_version"
           (Since Unicode::Collate::Locale 0.87) Returns the version number (perhaps "/\d\.\d\d/") of the locale, as that of Locale/*.pl.

           Note: Locale/*.pl that a collator uses should be identified by a combination of return values from "getlocale" and "locale_version".

       ru (Russian) without "[reorder Cyrl]", sw (Swahili), zu (Zulu).

       Note

       [1] ja: Ideographs are sorted in JIS X 0208 order.  Fullwidth and halfwidth forms are identical to their regular form.  The difference between hiragana and katakana is at the 4th level, the
       comparison also requires "(variable => 'Non-ignorable')", and then "katakana_before_hiragana" has no effect.

       [2] ko: Plenty of ideographs are sorted by their reading. Such an ideograph is primary (level 1) equal to, and secondary (level 2) greater than, the corresponding hangul syllable.

       [3] zh__pinyin, zh__stroke and zh__zhuyin: implemented alt='short', where a smaller number of ideographs are tailored.

INSTALL
       Installation of "Unicode::Collate::Locale" requires Collate/Locale.pm, Collate/Locale/*.pm, Collate/CJK/*.pm and Collate/allkeys.txt.  On building, "Unicode::Collate::Locale" doesn't require any
       of data/*.txt, gendata/*, and mklocale.  Tests for "Unicode::Collate::Locale" are named t/loc_*.t.

CAVEAT
       Tailoring is not maximum
           Even if a certain letter is tailored, its equivalent would not always tailored as well as it. For example, even though W is tailored, fullwidth W ("U+FF37"), W with acute ("U+1E82"), etc. are
           not tailored. The result may depend on whether source strings are normalized or not, and whether decomposed or composed.  Thus "(normalization => undef)" is less preferred.

       Collation reordering is not supported
           The order of any groups including scripts is not changed.
