NAME
       gnutls_idna_map - API function

SYNOPSIS
       #include <gnutls/gnutls.h>

       int gnutls_idna_map(const char * input, unsigned ilen, gnutls_datum_t * out, unsigned flags);

ARGUMENTS
       const char * input
                   contain the UTF-8 formatted domain name

       unsigned ilen
                   the length of the provided string

       gnutls_datum_t * out
                   the result in an null-terminated allocated string

       unsigned flags
                   should be zero

DESCRIPTION
       This  function will convert the provided UTF-8 domain name, to its IDNA mapping in an allocated variable. Note that depending on the flags the used gnutls library was compiled with, the output of
       this function may vary (i.e., may be IDNA2008, or IDNA2003).

       To force IDNA2008 specify the flag GNUTLS_IDNA_FORCE_2008. In the case GnuTLS is not compiled with the necessary dependencies, GNUTLS_E_UNIMPLEMENTED_FEATURE will be  returned  to  indicate  that
       gnutls is unable to perform the requested conversion.

       Note also, that this function will return an empty string if an empty string is provided as input.

RETURNS
       GNUTLS_E_INVALID_UTF8_STRING on invalid UTF-8 data, or 0 on success.

SINCE
       3.5.8
