NAME
       CURLOPT_ISSUERCERT - issuer SSL certificate filename

SYNOPSIS
       #include <curl/curl.h>

       CURLcode curl_easy_setopt(CURL *handle, CURLOPT_ISSUERCERT, char *file);

DESCRIPTION
       Pass  a  char * to a null-terminated string naming a file holding a CA certificate in PEM format. If the option is set, an additional check against the peer certificate is performed to verify the
       issuer is indeed the one associated with the certificate provided by the option. This additional check is useful in multi-level PKI where one needs to enforce that the peer certificate is from  a
       specific branch of the tree.

       This option makes sense only when used in combination with the CURLOPT_SSL_VERIFYPEER(3) option. Otherwise, the result of the check is not considered as failure.

       A  specific  error code (CURLE_SSL_ISSUER_ERROR) is defined with the option, which is returned if the setup of the SSL/TLS session has failed due to a mismatch with the issuer of peer certificate
       (CURLOPT_SSL_VERIFYPEER(3) has to be set too for the check to fail). (Added in 7.19.0)

       The application does not have to keep the string around after setting this option.

DEFAULT
       NULL

PROTOCOLS
       All TLS-based protocols

EXAMPLE
       CURL *curl = curl_easy_init();
       if(curl) {
         curl_easy_setopt(curl, CURLOPT_URL, "https://example.com/");
         curl_easy_setopt(curl, CURLOPT_ISSUERCERT, "/etc/certs/cacert.pem");
         ret = curl_easy_perform(curl);
         curl_easy_cleanup(curl);
       }

AVAILABILITY
       If built TLS enabled

RETURN VALUE
       Returns CURLE_OK if the option is supported, CURLE_UNKNOWN_OPTION if not, or CURLE_OUT_OF_MEMORY if there was insufficient heap space.
