Detailed Description
Function Documentation
   int hwloc_obj_add_info (hwloc_obj_t obj, const char * name, const char * value)
       Add the given info name and value pair to the given object. The info is appended to the existing info array even if another key with the same name already exists.

       The input strings are copied before being added in the object infos.

           0 on success, -1 on error.

       Note
           This function may be used to enforce object colors in the lstopo graphical output by using 'lstopoStyle' as a name and 'Background=#rrggbb' as a value. See CUSTOM COLORS in the lstopo(1)
           manpage for details.

           If value contains some non-printable characters, they will be dropped when exporting to XML, see hwloc_topology_export_xml() in hwloc/export.h.

   static const char* hwloc_obj_get_info_by_name (hwloc_obj_t obj, const char * name) [inline],  [static]

       Returns
