NAME
       sd-device - API for enumerating and introspecting local devices

SYNOPSIS
       #include <systemd/sd-device.h>

       pkg-config --cflags --libs libsystemd

DESCRIPTION
       sd-device.h provides an API to introspect and enumerate devices on the
       local system. It provides a programmatic interface to the database of
       devices and their properties mananaged by systemd-udevd.service(8).
       This API is a replacement for libudev(3) and libudev.h.

       See

           sd_device_get_syspath(3),
           sd_device_ref(3)

       for more information about the functions available.

NOTES
       These APIs are implemented as a shared library, which can be compiled
       and linked to with the libsystemd pkg-config(1) file.
