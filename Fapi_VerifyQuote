       Verifies that the data returned by a quote is valid.

       Parameters
           context The FAPI_CONTEXT
           publicKeyPath The path to the signing key
           qualifyingData The qualifying data nonce. May be NULL
           qualifyingDataSize The size of qualifyingData in bytes. Must be 0 if qualifyingData is NULL

           pcrLog The PCR's log. May be NULL

       Return values
           TSS2_RC_SUCCESS if the function call was a success.
           TSS2_FAPI_RC_BAD_REFERENCE if context, publicKeyPath, quoteInfo, or signature is NULL.
           TSS2_FAPI_RC_BAD_CONTEXT if context corruption is detected.
           TSS2_FAPI_RC_KEY_NOT_FOUND if path does not map to a FAPI entity.
           TSS2_FAPI_RC_BAD_KEY if the entity at path is not a key, or is a key that is unsuitable for the requested operation.
           TSS2_FAPI_RC_BAD_VALUE if quoteInfo, pcrEventLog, qualifyingData, or signature is invalid.
           TSS2_FAPI_RC_BAD_SEQUENCE if the context has an asynchronous operation already pending.
           TSS2_FAPI_RC_IO_ERROR if the data cannot be saved.
           TSS2_FAPI_RC_MEMORY if the FAPI cannot allocate enough memory for internal operations or return parameters.
           TSS2_FAPI_RC_PATH_NOT_FOUND if a FAPI object path was not found during authorization.
           TSS2_FAPI_RC_TRY_AGAIN if an I/O operation is not finished yet and this function needs to be called again.
           TSS2_FAPI_RC_GENERAL_FAILURE if an internal error occurred.
           TSS2_FAPI_RC_SIGNATURE_VERIFICATION_FAILED if the signature could not be verified
           TSS2_FAPI_RC_NOT_PROVISIONED FAPI was not provisioned.
           TSS2_FAPI_RC_BAD_PATH if the path is used in inappropriate context or contains illegal characters.

           signature The quote's signature
           signatureSize The size of signature in bytes
           pcrLog The PCR's log. May be NULL

       Return values
           TSS2_RC_SUCCESS if the function call was a success.
           TSS2_FAPI_RC_BAD_REFERENCE if context, publicKeyPath, quoteInfo, or signature is NULL.
