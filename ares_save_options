ARES_SAVE_OPTIONS(3)                                                                     Library Functions Manual                                                                     ARES_SAVE_OPTIONS(3)

NAME
       ares_save_options - Save configuration values obtained from initialized ares_channel

SYNOPSIS
       #include <ares.h>

       int ares_save_options(ares_channel channel,
                             struct ares_options *options, int *optmask)

DESCRIPTION
       The  ares_save_options(3)  function saves the channel data identified by channel, into the options struct identified by options, and saves the mask of options which are set to the integer pointer
       (passed by reference) identified by optmask.

       The resultant options and optmask are then able to be passed directly to ares_init_options.  When the options are no longer needed, ares_destroy_options should be called to  free  any  associated
       memory.

RETURN VALUES
       ares_save_options(3) can return any of the following values:

       ARES_SUCCESS   The channel data was successfully stored

       ARES_ENOMEM    The memory was exhausted

       ARES_ENODATA   The channel data identified by channel were invalid.

NOTE
       Since  c-ares  1.6.0  the ares_options struct has been "locked" meaning that it won't be extended to cover new functions. This function will remain functioning, but it can only return config data
       that can be represented in this config struct, which may no longer be the complete set of config options. ares_dup(3) will not have that restriction.

       The ares_options struct can not handle potential IPv6 name servers the ares_channel might be configured to use. The ares_save_options(3) function will only return IPv4 servers, if any.  In  order
       to retrieve all name servers an ares_channel might be using, the ares_get_servers(3) function must be used instead.

SEE ALSO
       ares_destroy_options(3), ares_init_options(3), ares_get_servers(3), ares_dup(3)

AVAILABILITY
       ares_save_options(3) was added in c-ares 1.4.0
