NAME
       io_uring_prep_poll_update - update an existing poll request

SYNOPSIS
       #include <poll.h>
       #include <liburing.h>

       void io_uring_prep_poll_update(struct io_uring_sqe *sqe,
                                      __u64 old_user_data,
                                      __u64 new_user_data,
                                      unsigned poll_mask,
                                      unsigned flags);

DESCRIPTION
       The  io_uring_prep_poll_update(3)  function  prepares  a  poll  update request. The submission queue entry sqe is setup to update a poll request identified by old_user_data, replacing it with the
       new_user_data information. The poll_mask arguments contains the new mask to use for the poll request, and flags argument contains modifier flags telling io_uring what fields to update.

       The flags modifier flags is a bitmask and may contain and OR'ed mask of:

       IORING_POLL_UPDATE_EVENTS
              If set, the poll update request will replace the existing events being waited for with the ones specified in the poll_mask argument to the function.

       IORING_POLL_UPDATE_USER_DATA
              If set, the poll update request will update the existing user_data of the request with the value passed in as the new_user_data argument.

       IORING_POLL_ADD_MULTI
              If set, this will change the poll request from a singleshot to a multishot request. This must be used along with IORING_POLL_UPDATE_EVENTS as the event field must be updated to enable mul‐
              tishot.

RETURN VALUE
       None

ERRORS
       These are the errors that are reported in the CQE res field. On success, 0 is returned.

       -ENOENT
              The request identified by user_data could not be located. This could be because it completed before the cancelation request was issued, or if an invalid identifier is used.

       -EINVAL
              One of the fields set in the SQE was invalid.

       -EALREADY
              The execution state of the request has progressed far enough that cancelation is no longer possible. This should normally mean that it will complete shortly, either successfully, or inter‐
              rupted due to the cancelation.

       -ECANCELED
              IORING_POLL_UPDATE_EVENTS was set and an error occurred re-arming the poll request with the new mask.  The original poll request is terminated if this happens,  and  that  termination  CQE
              will contain the reason for the error re-arming.
