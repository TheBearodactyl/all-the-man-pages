NAME
       asn1_parser2tree - API function

SYNOPSIS
       #include <libtasn1.h>

       int asn1_parser2tree(const char * file, asn1_node * definitions, char * error_desc);

ARGUMENTS
       const char * file
                   specify the path and the name of file that contains ASN.1 declarations.

       asn1_node * definitions
                   return the pointer to the structure created from "file" ASN.1 declarations.

       char * error_desc
                   return the error description or an empty string if success.

DESCRIPTION
       Function used to start the parse algorithm.  Creates the structures needed to manage the definitions included in  file file.

       ASN1_SUCCESS  if  the  file  has  a  correct  syntax and every identifier is known, ASN1_ELEMENT_NOT_EMPTY if  definitions not NULL, ASN1_FILE_NOT_FOUND if an error occurred while opening  file ,
       ASN1_SYNTAX_ERROR if the syntax is not correct, ASN1_IDENTIFIER_NOT_FOUND if in the file there is an identifier that is not defined, ASN1_NAME_TOO_LONG if in the file there is an identifier  with
