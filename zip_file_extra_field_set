ZIP_FILE_EXTRA_FIELD_SET(3)                                                            BSD Library Functions Manual                                                            ZIP_FILE_EXTRA_FIELD_SET(3)

NAME
     zip_file_extra_field_set â€” set extra field for file in zip

LIBRARY
     libzip (-lzip)

SYNOPSIS
     #include <zip.h>

     int
     zip_file_extra_field_set(zip_t *archive, zip_uint64_t index, zip_uint16_t extra_field_id, zip_uint16_t extra_field_index, const zip_uint8_t *extra_field_data, zip_uint16_t len, zip_flags_t flags);

DESCRIPTION
     The zip_file_extra_field_set() function sets the extra field with ID (two-byte signature) extra_field_id and index extra_field_index for the file at position index in the zip archive.  The extra
     field's data will be set to extra_field_data and length len.  If a new entry shall be appended, set extra_field_index to ZIP_EXTRA_FIELD_NEW.

     At least one of the following flags must be set:

           ZIP_FL_CENTRAL    Set extra field in the archive's central directory.

           ZIP_FL_LOCAL      Set extra field in the local file headers.

     Please note that the extra field IDs 0x0001 (ZIP64 extension), 0x6375 (Infozip UTF-8 comment), and 0x7075 (Infozip UTF-8 file name) can not be set using zip_file_extra_field_set() since they are
     set by libzip(3) automatically when needed.

RETURN VALUES
     Upon successful completion 0 is returned.  Otherwise, -1 is returned and the error code in archive is set to indicate the error.

ERRORS
     zip_file_extra_field_set() fails if:

     [ZIP_ER_INVAL]     The extra field size is too large (ID and length need 4 bytes; the maximum length of all extra fields for one file combined is 65536 bytes).  This error also occurs if
                        extra_field_index is too large.

     [ZIP_ER_MEMORY]    Required memory could not be allocated.

     [ZIP_ER_NOENT]     index is not a valid file index in archive.
