NAME
       XkbGetNamedGeometry - Loads a keyboard geometry description from this database by name

SYNOPSIS
       Status XkbGetNamedGeometry (Display *dpy, XkbDescPtr xkb, Atom name);

ARGUMENTS
       dpy    connection to the X server

       xkb    keyboard description into which the geometry should be loaded

       name   name of the geometry to be loaded

DESCRIPTION
       It is also possible to load a keyboard geometry by name. The X server maintains a database of keyboard components (see below).

       XkbGetNamedGeometry can return BadName if the name cannot be found.

       The X server maintains a database of keyboard components, identified by component type.  The database contains all the information necessary to build a complete keyboard description for a partic‐
       ular device, as well as to assemble partial descriptions. Table 1 identifies the component types and the type of information they contain.

       While a keymap is a database entry for a complete keyboard description, and therefore logically different from the individual component database entries, the rules for processing  keymap  entries
       are identical to those for the individual components.  In the discussion that follows, the term component is used to refer to either individual components or a keymap.

       There  may  be multiple entries for each of the component types. An entry may be either complete or partial.  Partial entries describe only a piece of the corresponding keyboard component and are
       designed to be combined with other entries of the same type to form a complete entry.

       For example, a partial symbols map might describe the differences between a common ASCII keyboard and some national layout. Such a partial map is not useful on its own because it does not include
       those  symbols  that are the same on both the ASCII and national layouts (such as function keys). On the other hand, this partial map can be used to configure any ASCII keyboard to use a national
       layout.

       When a keyboard description is built, the components are processed in the order in which they appear in Table 1; later definitions override earlier ones.
