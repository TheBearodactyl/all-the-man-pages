NAME
       MailTools - bundle of ancient email modules

SYNOPSIS
        # This is a place-holder for the distribution

DESCRIPTION
       MailTools is a bundle: an ancient form of combining packages into one distribution.  Gladly, it can be distributed as if it is a normal distribution as well.

       Be warned: The code you find here is very old.  It works for simple emails, but when you start with new code then please use more sofisticated libraries.  The main reason that you still find this
       code on CPAN, is because many books use it as example.

   Component
       In this distribution, you find

       Mail::Address
           Parse email address from a header line.

       Mail::Cap
           Interpret mailcap files: mappings of file-types to applications as used by many command-line email programs.

       Mail::Field
           Simplifies access to (some) email header fields.  Used by Mail::Header.

       Mail::Filter
           Process Mail::Internet messages.

       Mail::Header
           Collection of Mail::Field objects, representing the header of a Mail::Internet object.

       Mail::Internet
           Represents a single email message, with header and body.

       Mail::Mailer
           Send Mail::Internet emails via direct smtp or local MTA's.

       Mail::Send
           Build a Mail::Internet object, and then send it out using Mail::Mailer.

       Mail::Util
           "Smart functions" you should not depend on.
