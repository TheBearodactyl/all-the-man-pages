NAME
       gnutls_x509_crl_iter_crt_serial - API function

SYNOPSIS
       #include <gnutls/x509.h>

       int gnutls_x509_crl_iter_crt_serial(gnutls_x509_crl_t crl, gnutls_x509_crl_iter_t * iter, unsigned char * serial, size_t * serial_size, time_t * t);

ARGUMENTS
       gnutls_x509_crl_t crl
                   should contain a gnutls_x509_crl_t type

       gnutls_x509_crl_iter_t * iter
                   A pointer to an iterator (initially the iterator should be NULL)

       unsigned char * serial
                   where the serial number will be copied

       size_t * serial_size
                   initially holds the size of serial

       time_t * t  if non null, will hold the time this certificate was revoked

DESCRIPTION
       This  function  performs  the  same  as gnutls_x509_crl_get_crt_serial(), but reads sequentially and keeps state in the iterator between calls. That allows it to provide better performance in se‐
       quences with many elements (50000+).

       When past the last element is accessed GNUTLS_E_REQUESTED_DATA_NOT_AVAILABLE is returned and the iterator is reset.

       After use, the iterator must be deinitialized using gnutls_x509_crl_iter_deinit().

RETURNS
       On success, GNUTLS_E_SUCCESS (0) is returned, otherwise a negative error value.
