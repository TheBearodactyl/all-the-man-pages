NAME
       fish_indent - indenter and prettifier

SYNOPSIS
       fish_indent [OPTIONS] [FILE ...]

DESCRIPTION
       fish_indent is used to indent a piece of fish code. fish_indent reads commands from standard input or the given filenames and outputs them to standard output or a specified file (if -w is given).

       The following options are available:

       -w or --write
              Indents a specified file and immediately writes to that file.

       -i or --no-indent
              Do not indent commands; only reformat to one job per line.

       -c or --check
              Do not indent, only return 0 if the code is already indented as fish_indent would, the number of failed files otherwise. Also print the failed filenames if not reading from standard input.

       -v or --version
              Displays the current fish version and then exits.

       --ansi Colorizes the output using ANSI escape sequences, appropriate for the current TERM, using the colors defined in the environment (such as fish_color_command).

       --html Outputs HTML, which supports syntax highlighting if the appropriate CSS is defined. The CSS class names are the same as the variable names, such as fish_color_command.

       -d or --debug=DEBUG_CATEGORIES
              Enable debug output and specify a pattern for matching debug categories. See Debugging in fish (1) for details.

       -o or --debug-output=DEBUG_FILE
              Specify a file path to receive the debug output, including categories and fish_trace. The default is standard error.

       --dump-parse-tree
              Dumps information about the parsed statements to standard error. This is likely to be of interest only to people working on the fish source code.

       -h or --help
              Displays help about using this command.
