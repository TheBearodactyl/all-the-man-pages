sinh(3)                    Library Functions Manual                    sinh(3)

NAME
       sinh, sinhf, sinhl - hyperbolic sine function

LIBRARY
       Math library (libm, -lm)

SYNOPSIS
       #include <math.h>

       double sinh(double x);
       float sinhf(float x);
       long double sinhl(long double x);

   Feature Test Macro Requirements for glibc (see feature_test_macros(7)):

       sinhf(), sinhl():
           _ISOC99_SOURCE || _POSIX_C_SOURCE >= 200112L
               || /* Since glibc 2.19: */ _DEFAULT_SOURCE
               || /* glibc <= 2.19: */ _BSD_SOURCE || _SVID_SOURCE

DESCRIPTION
       These functions return the hyperbolic sine of x, which is defined math‐
       ematically as:

           sinh(x) = (exp(x) - exp(-x)) / 2

RETURN VALUE
       On success, these functions return the hyperbolic sine of x.

       If x is a NaN, a NaN is returned.

       If x is +0 (-0), +0 (-0) is returned.

       If x is positive infinity (negative infinity), positive infinity (nega‐
       tive infinity) is returned.

       If the result overflows, a range error occurs, and the functions return
       HUGE_VAL, HUGE_VALF, or HUGE_VALL, respectively, with the same sign  as
       x.

ERRORS
       See  math_error(7) for information on how to determine whether an error
       has occurred when calling these functions.

       The following errors can occur:

       Range error: result overflow
              errno is set to ERANGE.  An  overflow  floating-point  exception
              (FE_OVERFLOW) is raised.

NAME
       sinh, sinhf, sinhl — hyperbolic sine functions

SYNOPSIS
       #include <math.h>

       double sinh(double x);
       float sinhf(float x);
       long double sinhl(long double x);

DESCRIPTION
       The functionality described on this reference page is aligned with  the
       ISO C  standard.  Any  conflict between the requirements described here
       and the ISO C standard is unintentional. This  volume  of  POSIX.1‐2017
       defers to the ISO C standard.

       These functions shall compute the hyperbolic sine of their argument x.

       An  application  wishing to check for error situations should set errno
       to zero and  call  feclearexcept(FE_ALL_EXCEPT)  before  calling  these
       functions. On return, if errno is non-zero or fetestexcept(FE_INVALID |
       FE_DIVBYZERO | FE_OVERFLOW | FE_UNDERFLOW) is non-zero,  an  error  has
       occurred.

RETURN VALUE
       Upon successful completion, these functions shall return the hyperbolic
       sine of x.

       If the result would cause an overflow, a range error  shall  occur  and
       ±HUGE_VAL,  ±HUGE_VALF,  and ±HUGE_VALL (with the same sign as x) shall
       be returned as appropriate for the type of the function.

       If x is NaN, a NaN shall be returned.

       If x is ±0 or ±Inf, x shall be returned.

       If x is subnormal, a range error may occur
       and x should be returned.

       If x is not returned, sinh(), sinhf(), and sinhl() shall return an  im‐
       plementation-defined  value  no  greater  in  magnitude  than  DBL_MIN,
       FLT_MIN, and LDBL_MIN, respectively.

ERRORS
       These functions shall fail if:

       Range Error The result would cause an overflow.

                   If the integer expression (math_errhandling  &  MATH_ERRNO)
                   is  non-zero,  then errno shall be set to [ERANGE].  If the
                   integer expression (math_errhandling &  MATH_ERREXCEPT)  is
                   non-zero,  then the overflow floating-point exception shall
                   be raised.

       These functions may fail if:

       Range Error The value x is subnormal.

                   If the integer expression (math_errhandling  &  MATH_ERRNO)
                   is  non-zero,  then errno shall be set to [ERANGE].  If the
                   integer expression (math_errhandling &  MATH_ERREXCEPT)  is
                   non-zero, then the underflow floating-point exception shall
                   be raised.

       The following sections are informative.

EXAMPLES
       None.

APPLICATION USAGE
       On error, the expressions (math_errhandling & MATH_ERRNO) and (math_er‐
       rhandling & MATH_ERREXCEPT) are independent of each other, but at least
       one of them must be non-zero.

RATIONALE
       None.

FUTURE DIRECTIONS
       None.
