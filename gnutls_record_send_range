NAME
       gnutls_record_send_range - API function

SYNOPSIS
       #include <gnutls/gnutls.h>

       ssize_t gnutls_record_send_range(gnutls_session_t session, const void * data, size_t data_size, const gnutls_range_st * range);

ARGUMENTS
       gnutls_session_t session
                   is a gnutls_session_t type.

       const void * data
                   contains the data to send.

       size_t data_size
                   is the length of the data.

       const gnutls_range_st * range
                   is the range of lengths in which the real data length must be hidden.

DESCRIPTION
       This function operates like gnutls_record_send() but, while gnutls_record_send() adds minimal padding to each TLS record, this function uses the TLS extra-padding feature to conceal the real data
       size within the range of lengths provided.  Some TLS sessions do not support extra padding (e.g. stream ciphers in standard TLS or SSL3 sessions). To know whether the current session supports ex‐
       tra padding, and hence length hiding, use the gnutls_record_can_use_length_hiding() function.

NOTE
       This function currently is limited to blocking sockets.

RETURNS
       The number of bytes sent (that is data_size in a successful invocation), or a negative error code.
