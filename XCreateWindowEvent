NAME
       XCreateWindowEvent - CreateNotify event structure

STRUCTURES
       The structure for CreateNotify events contains:

       typedef struct {
               int type;       /* CreateNotify */
               unsigned long serial;   /* # of last request processed by server */
               Bool send_event;        /* true if this came from a SendEvent request */
               Display *display;       /* Display the event was read from */
               Window parent;  /* parent of the window */
               Window window;  /* window id of window created */
               int x, y;       /* window location */
               int width, height;      /* size of window */
               int border_width;       /* border width */
               Bool override_redirect; /* creation should be overridden */
       } XCreateWindowEvent;

       When you receive this event, the structure members are set as follows.

       The  type  member is set to the event type constant name that uniquely identifies it.  For example, when the X server reports a GraphicsExpose event to a client application, it sends an XGraphic‐
       sExposeEvent structure with the type member set to GraphicsExpose.  The display member is set to a pointer to the display the event was read on.  The send_event member is set to True if the event
       came  from a SendEvent protocol request.  The serial member is set from the serial number reported in the protocol but expanded from the 16-bit least-significant bits to a full 32-bit value.  The
       window member is set to the window that is most useful to toolkit dispatchers.

       The parent member is set to the created window's parent.  The window member specifies the created window.  The x and y members are set to the created window's coordinates relative to  the  parent
       window's origin and indicate the position of the upper-left outside corner of the created window.  The width and height members are set to the inside size of the created window (not including the
       border) and are always nonzero.  The border_width member is set to the width of the created window's border, in pixels.  The override_redirect member is set to the override-redirect attribute  of
       the window.  Window manager clients normally should ignore this window if the override_redirect member is True.
