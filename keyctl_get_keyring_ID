KEYCTL_GET_KEYRING_ID(3)                                                                Linux Key Management Calls                                                                KEYCTL_GET_KEYRING_ID(3)

NAME
       keyctl_get_keyring_ID - get the ID of a special keyring

SYNOPSIS
       #include <keyutils.h>

       key_serial_t keyctl_get_keyring_ID(key_serial_t key,
        int create);

DESCRIPTION
       keyctl_get_keyring_ID() maps a special key or keyring ID to the serial number of the key actually representing that feature.  The serial number will be returned if that key exists.

       If the key or keyring does not yet exist, then if create is non-zero, the key or keyring will be created if it is appropriate to do so.

       The following special key IDs may be specified as key:

       KEY_SPEC_THREAD_KEYRING
              This specifies the caller's thread-specific keyring.

       KEY_SPEC_PROCESS_KEYRING
              This specifies the caller's process-specific keyring.

       KEY_SPEC_SESSION_KEYRING
              This specifies the caller's session-specific keyring.

       KEY_SPEC_USER_KEYRING
              This specifies the caller's UID-specific keyring.

       KEY_SPEC_USER_SESSION_KEYRING
              This specifies the caller's UID-session keyring.

       KEY_SPEC_REQKEY_AUTH_KEY
              This specifies the authorisation key created by request_key() and passed to the process it spawns to generate a key.

       If a valid keyring ID is passed in, then this will simply be returned if the key exists; an error will be issued if it doesn't exist.

RETURN VALUE
       On success keyctl_get_keyring_ID() returns the serial number of the key it found.  On error, the value -1 will be returned and errno will have been set to an appropriate error.

ERRORS
       ENOKEY No matching key was found.

       ENOMEM Insufficient memory to create a key.

       EDQUOT The key quota for this user would be exceeded by creating this key or linking it to the keyring.

LINKING
       This is a library function that can be found in libkeyutils.  When linking, -lkeyutils should be specified to the linker.
