ARGUMENTS
       const char * token_url
                   A PKCS 11 URL specifying a token

DESCRIPTION
       This  function  will  modify  or set a user or administrator's PIN for the given token.  If it is called to set a PIN for first time the oldpin must be NULL. When setting the admin's PIN with the
       GNUTLS_PIN_SO flag, the  oldpin value must be provided (this requirement is relaxed after GnuTLS 3.6.5 since which the PIN will be requested if missing).

RETURNS
       On success, GNUTLS_E_SUCCESS (0) is returned, otherwise a negative error value.
