NAME
       gnutls_x509_crt_get_pk_algorithm - API function

SYNOPSIS
       #include <gnutls/x509.h>

       int gnutls_x509_crt_get_pk_algorithm(gnutls_x509_crt_t cert, unsigned int * bits);

ARGUMENTS
       gnutls_x509_crt_t cert
                   should contain a gnutls_x509_crt_t type

       unsigned int * bits
                   if bits is non null it will hold the size of the parameters' in bits

DESCRIPTION
       This function will return the public key algorithm of an X.509 certificate.

       If bits is non null, it should have enough size to hold the parameters size in bits. For RSA the bits returned is the modulus.  For DSA the bits returned are of the public exponent.

       Unknown/unsupported algorithms are mapped to GNUTLS_PK_UNKNOWN.

RETURNS
       a member of the gnutls_pk_algorithm_t enumeration on success, or a negative error code on error.
