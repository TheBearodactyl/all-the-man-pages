pthread_attr_setstacksize(3Library Functions Manuapthread_attr_setstacksize(3)

NAME
       pthread_attr_setstacksize,  pthread_attr_getstacksize  -  set/get stack
       size attribute in thread attributes object

LIBRARY
       POSIX threads library (libpthread, -lpthread)

SYNOPSIS
       #include <pthread.h>

       int pthread_attr_setstacksize(pthread_attr_t *attr, size_t stacksize);
       int pthread_attr_getstacksize(const pthread_attr_t *restrict attr,
                                     size_t *restrict stacksize);

DESCRIPTION
       The pthread_attr_setstacksize() function sets the stack size  attribute
       of the thread attributes object referred to by attr to the value speci‐
       fied in stacksize.

       The stack size attribute determines the minimum size  (in  bytes)  that
       will  be  allocated for threads created using the thread attributes ob‐
       ject attr.

       The pthread_attr_getstacksize() function returns the stack size  attri‐
       bute  of the thread attributes object referred to by attr in the buffer
       pointed to by stacksize.

RETURN VALUE
       On success, these functions return 0; on error, they return  a  nonzero
       error number.

ERRORS
       pthread_attr_setstacksize() can fail with the following error:

       EINVAL The stack size is less than PTHREAD_STACK_MIN (16384) bytes.

       On  some  systems,  pthread_attr_setstacksize() can fail with the error
       EINVAL if stacksize is not a multiple of the system page size.

VERSIONS
       These functions are provided since glibc 2.1.

STANDARDS
       POSIX.1-2001, POSIX.1-2008.

NOTES
       For details on the default stack size of new threads, see  pthread_cre‐
       ate(3).

       A  thread's  stack  size is fixed at the time of thread creation.  Only
       the main thread can dynamically grow its stack.

       The pthread_attr_setstack(3) function allows an application to set both
       the size and location of a caller-allocated stack that is to be used by
       a thread.

BUGS
       As at glibc 2.8, if the  specified  stacksize  is  not  a  multiple  of
       STACK_ALIGN  (16  bytes on most architectures), it may be rounded down‐
       ward, in violation of POSIX.1, which says that the allocated stack will
       be at least stacksize bytes.

EXAMPLES
       See pthread_create(3).

PROLOG
       This  manual  page is part of the POSIX Programmer's Manual.  The Linux
       implementation of this interface may differ (consult the  corresponding
       Linux  manual page for details of Linux behavior), or the interface may
       not be implemented on Linux.

NAME
       pthread_attr_getstacksize, pthread_attr_setstacksize — get and set the
       stacksize attribute

SYNOPSIS
       #include <pthread.h>

       int pthread_attr_getstacksize(const pthread_attr_t *restrict attr,
           size_t *restrict stacksize);
       int pthread_attr_setstacksize(pthread_attr_t *attr, size_t stacksize);

DESCRIPTION
       The  pthread_attr_getstacksize()  and pthread_attr_setstacksize() func‐
       tions, respectively, shall get and set the  thread  creation  stacksize
       attribute in the attr object.

       The  stacksize attribute shall define the minimum stack size (in bytes)
       allocated for the created threads stack.

       The behavior is undefined if the value specified by the  attr  argument
       to  pthread_attr_getstacksize() or pthread_attr_setstacksize() does not
       refer to an initialized thread attributes object.

RETURN VALUE
       Upon    successful    completion,    pthread_attr_getstacksize()    and
       pthread_attr_setstacksize()  shall  return  a value of 0; otherwise, an
       error number shall be returned to indicate the error.

       The pthread_attr_getstacksize() function stores the stacksize attribute
       value in stacksize if successful.

ERRORS
       The pthread_attr_setstacksize() function shall fail if:

       EINVAL The  value  of stacksize is less than {PTHREAD_STACK_MIN} or ex‐
              ceeds a system-imposed limit.

       These functions shall not return an error code of [EINTR].

       The following sections are informative.

EXAMPLES
       None.

APPLICATION USAGE
       None.

RATIONALE
       If an implementation detects that the value specified by the attr argu‐
       ment to pthread_attr_getstacksize() or pthread_attr_setstacksize() does
       not refer to an initialized thread attributes object, it is recommended
       that the function should fail and report an [EINVAL] error.

FUTURE DIRECTIONS
       None.
