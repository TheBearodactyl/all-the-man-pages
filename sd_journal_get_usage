NAME
       sd_journal_get_usage - Journal disk usage

SYNOPSIS
       #include <systemd/sd-journal.h>

       int sd_journal_get_usage(sd_journal *j, uint64_t *bytes);

DESCRIPTION
       sd_journal_get_usage() determines the total disk space currently used
       by journal files (in bytes). If SD_JOURNAL_LOCAL_ONLY was passed when
       opening the journal, this value will only reflect the size of journal
       files of the local host, otherwise of all hosts.

RETURN VALUE
       sd_journal_get_usage() returns 0 on success or a negative errno-style
       error code.

NOTES
       All functions listed here are thread-agnostic and only a single
       specific thread may operate on a given object during its entire
       lifetime. It's safe to allocate multiple independent objects and use
       each from a specific thread in parallel. However, it's not safe to
       allocate such an object in one thread, and operate or free it from any
       other, even if locking is used to ensure these threads don't operate on
       it at the very same time.

       These APIs are implemented as a shared library, which can be compiled
       and linked to with the libsystemd pkg-config(1) file.
