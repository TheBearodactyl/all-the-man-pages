NAME
       PCRE2 - Perl-compatible regular expressions (revised API)

SYNOPSIS

       #include <pcre2.h>

       int pcre2_substring_copy_bynumber(pcre2_match_data *match_data,
         uint32_t number, PCRE2_UCHAR *buffer,
         PCRE2_SIZE *bufflen);

DESCRIPTION

       This is a convenience function for extracting a captured substring into
       a given buffer. The arguments are:

         match_data    The match data block for the match
         number        Number of the required substring
         buffer        Buffer to receive the string
         bufflen       Length of buffer

       The bufflen variable is  updated  with  the  length  of  the  extracted
       string,  excluding  the  terminating zero. The yield of the function is
       zero for success or one of the following error numbers:

         PCRE2_ERROR_NOSUBSTRING   there are no groups of that number
         PCRE2_ERROR_UNAVAILBLE    the ovector was too small for that group
         PCRE2_ERROR_UNSET         the group did not participate in the match
         PCRE2_ERROR_NOMEMORY      the buffer is too small

       There is a complete description of the PCRE2 native API in the pcre2api
       page and a description of the POSIX API in the pcre2posix page.
