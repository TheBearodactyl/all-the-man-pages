SSL_GET_CERTIFICATE(3ssl)           OpenSSL          SSL_GET_CERTIFICATE(3ssl)

NAME
       SSL_get_certificate, SSL_get_privatekey - retrieve TLS/SSL certificate
       and private key

SYNOPSIS
        #include <openssl/ssl.h>

        X509 *SSL_get_certificate(const SSL *s);
        EVP_PKEY *SSL_get_privatekey(const SSL *s);

DESCRIPTION
       SSL_get_certificate() returns a pointer to an X509 object representing
       a certificate used as the local peer's identity.

       Multiple certificates can be configured; for example, a server might
       have both RSA and ECDSA certificates. The certificate which is returned
       by SSL_get_certificate() is determined as follows:

       •   If it is called before certificate selection has occurred, it
           returns the most recently added certificate, or NULL if no
           certificate has been added.

       •   After certificate selection has occurred, it returns the
           certificate which was selected during the handshake, or NULL if no
           certificate was selected (for example, on a client where no client
           certificate is in use).

       Certificate selection occurs during the handshake; therefore, the value
       returned by SSL_get_certificate() during any callback made during the
       handshake process will depend on whether that callback is made before
       or after certificate selection occurs.

       A specific use for SSL_get_certificate() is inside a callback set via a
       call to SSL_CTX_set_tlsext_status_cb(3). This callback occurs after
       certificate selection, where it can be used to examine a server's
       chosen certificate, for example for the purpose of identifying a
       certificate's OCSP responder URL so that an OCSP response can be
       obtained.

       SSL_get_privatekey() returns a pointer to the EVP_PKEY object
       corresponding to the certificate returned by SSL_get_certificate(), if
       any.

RETURN VALUES
       These functions return pointers to their respective objects, or NULL if
       no such object is available. Returned objects are owned by the SSL
       object and should not be freed by users of these functions.
