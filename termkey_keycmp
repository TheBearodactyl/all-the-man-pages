NAME
       termkey_keycmp - compare two key events

SYNOPSIS
       #include <termkey.h>

       int termkey_keycmp(TermKey *tk, const TermKeyKey *key1,
                    const TermKeyKey *key2);

       Link with -ltermkey.

DESCRIPTION
       termkey_keycmp() compares two key structures and applies a total ordering, returning a value that is negative, zero, or positive, to indicate if the given structures are increasing, identical, or
       decreasing. Before comparison, copies of both referenced structures are taken, and canonicalised according to the rules for termkey_canonicalise(3).

       Two structures of differing type are ordered TERMKEY_TYPE_UNICODE, TERMKEY_TYPE_KEYSYM, TERMKEY_TYPE_FUNCTION, TERMKEY_TYPE_MOUSE. Unicode structures are ordered by codepoint,  keysym  structures
       are  ordered  by  keysym  number, function structures are ordered by function key number, and mouse structures are ordered opaquely by an unspecified but consistent ordering. Within these values,
       keys different in modifier bits are ordered by the modifiers.

RETURN VALUE
       termkey_keycmp() returns an integer greater than, equal to, or less than zero to indicate the relation between the two given key structures.
