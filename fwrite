NAME
       fread, fwrite - binary stream input/output

LIBRARY
       Standard C library (libc, -lc)

SYNOPSIS
       #include <stdio.h>

       size_t fread(void ptr[restrict .size * .nmemb],
                    size_t size, size_t nmemb,
                    FILE *restrict stream);
       size_t fwrite(const void ptr[restrict .size * .nmemb],
                    size_t size, size_t nmemb,
                    FILE *restrict stream);

DESCRIPTION
       The function fread() reads nmemb items of data, each size bytes long, from the stream pointed to by stream, storing them at the location given by ptr.

       The function fwrite() writes nmemb items of data, each size bytes long, to the stream pointed to by stream, obtaining them from the location given by ptr.

       For nonlocking counterparts, see unlocked_stdio(3).

RETURN VALUE
       On  success,  fread() and fwrite() return the number of items read or written.  This number equals the number of bytes transferred only when size is 1.  If an error occurs, or the end of the file
       is reached, the return value is a short item count (or zero).

       The file position indicator for the stream is advanced by the number of bytes successfully read or written.

       fread() does not distinguish between end-of-file and error, and callers must use feof(3) and ferror(3) to determine which occurred.

HISTORY
       POSIX.1-2001, C89.

EXAMPLES
       The program below demonstrates the use of fread() by parsing /bin/sh ELF executable in binary mode and printing its magic and class:

           $ ./a.out
           ELF magic: 0x7f454c46
           Class: 0x02

   Program source

       #include <stdio.h>
       #include <stdlib.h>

       #define ARRAY_SIZE(arr) (sizeof(arr) / sizeof((arr)[0]))

       int
       main(void)
       {
           FILE           *fp;
           size_t         ret;
           unsigned char  buffer[4];

           fp = fopen("/bin/sh", "rb");
           if (!fp) {
               perror("fopen");
               return EXIT_FAILURE;
           }

           ret = fread(buffer, sizeof(*buffer), ARRAY_SIZE(buffer), fp);
           if (ret != ARRAY_SIZE(buffer)) {
               fprintf(stderr, "fread() failed: %zu\n", ret);
               exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
           }

           printf("ELF magic: %#04x%02x%02x%02x\n", buffer[0], buffer[1],
                  buffer[2], buffer[3]);

           ret = fread(buffer, 1, 1, fp);
           if (ret != 1) {
               fprintf(stderr, "fread() failed: %zu\n", ret);
               exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
           }

           printf("Class: %#04x\n", buffer[0]);

PROLOG

       the interface may not be implemented on Linux.

NAME
       fwrite — binary output

SYNOPSIS
       #include <stdio.h>

       size_t fwrite(const void *restrict ptr, size_t size, size_t nitems,
           FILE *restrict stream);

DESCRIPTION
       The functionality described on this reference page is aligned with the ISO C standard. Any conflict between the requirements described here and the ISO C standard is unintentional. This volume of
       POSIX.1‐2017 defers to the ISO C standard.

       The  fwrite() function shall write, from the array pointed to by ptr, up to nitems elements whose size is specified by size, to the stream pointed to by stream.  For each object, size calls shall
       be made to the fputc() function, taking the values (in order) from an array of unsigned char exactly overlaying the object. The file-position indicator for the stream (if defined)  shall  be  ad‐
       vanced by the number of bytes successfully written. If an error occurs, the resulting value of the file-position indicator for the stream is unspecified.

       The  last data modification and last file status change timestamps of the file shall be marked for update between the successful execution of fwrite() and the next successful completion of a call
       to fflush() or fclose() on the same stream, or a call to exit() or abort().

RETURN VALUE
       The fwrite() function shall return the number of elements successfully written, which may be less than nitems if a write error is encountered. If size or nitems is 0, fwrite() shall return 0  and
       the state of the stream remains unchanged. Otherwise, if a write error occurs, the error indicator for the stream shall be set, and errno shall be set to indicate the error.

ERRORS
       Refer to fputc().

       The following sections are informative.

EXAMPLES
       None.

APPLICATION USAGE
       Because  of  possible differences in element length and byte ordering, files written using fwrite() are application-dependent, and possibly cannot be read using fread() by a different application
       or by the same application on a different processor.

RATIONALE
       None.

FUTURE DIRECTIONS
       None.
