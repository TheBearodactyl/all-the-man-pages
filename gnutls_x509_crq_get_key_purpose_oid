NAME
       gnutls_x509_crq_get_key_purpose_oid - API function

SYNOPSIS
       #include <gnutls/x509.h>

       int gnutls_x509_crq_get_key_purpose_oid(gnutls_x509_crq_t crq, unsigned indx, void * oid, size_t * sizeof_oid, unsigned int * critical);

ARGUMENTS
       gnutls_x509_crq_t crq
                   should contain a gnutls_x509_crq_t type

       unsigned indx
                   This specifies which OID to return, use (0) to get the first one

       void * oid  a pointer to store the OID (may be NULL)

       size_t * sizeof_oid
                   initially holds the size of  oid

       unsigned int * critical
                   output variable with critical flag, may be NULL.

DESCRIPTION
       This  function  will  extract the key purpose OIDs of the Certificate specified by the given index.  These are stored in the Extended Key Usage extension (2.5.29.37).  See the GNUTLS_KP_* defini‐
       tions for human readable names.

RETURNS
       GNUTLS_E_SHORT_MEMORY_BUFFER if the provided buffer is not long enough, and in that case the * sizeof_oid will be updated with the required size.  On success 0 is returned.

SINCE
       2.8.0
