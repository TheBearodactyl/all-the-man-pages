NAME
       gnutls_pkcs11_crt_is_known - API function

SYNOPSIS
       #include <gnutls/pkcs11.h>

       unsigned gnutls_pkcs11_crt_is_known(const char * url, gnutls_x509_crt_t cert, unsigned int flags);

ARGUMENTS
       const char * url
                   A PKCS 11 url identifying a token

       gnutls_x509_crt_t cert
                   is the certificate to find issuer for

       unsigned int flags
                   Use zero or flags from GNUTLS_PKCS11_OBJ_FLAG.

DESCRIPTION
       This   function   will   check   whether   the  provided  certificate  is  stored  in  the  specified  token.  This  is  useful  in  combination  with  GNUTLS_PKCS11_OBJ_FLAG_RETRIEVE_TRUSTED  or
       GNUTLS_PKCS11_OBJ_FLAG_RETRIEVE_DISTRUSTED, to check whether a CA is present or a certificate is distrusted in a trust PKCS 11 module.

       This function can  be  used  with  a   url  of  "pkcs11:",  and  in  that  case  all  modules  will  be  searched.  To  restrict  the  modules  to  the  marked  as  trusted  in  p11-kit  use  the
       GNUTLS_PKCS11_OBJ_FLAG_PRESENT_IN_TRUSTED_MODULE flag.

       Note that the flag GNUTLS_PKCS11_OBJ_FLAG_RETRIEVE_DISTRUSTED is specific to p11-kit trust modules.

RETURNS
       If the certificate exists non-zero is returned, otherwise zero.
