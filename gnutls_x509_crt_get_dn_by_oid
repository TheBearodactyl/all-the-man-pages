NAME
       gnutls_x509_crt_get_dn_by_oid - API function

SYNOPSIS
       #include <gnutls/x509.h>

       int gnutls_x509_crt_get_dn_by_oid(gnutls_x509_crt_t cert, const char * oid, unsigned indx, unsigned int raw_flag, void * buf, size_t * buf_size);

ARGUMENTS
       gnutls_x509_crt_t cert
                   should contain a gnutls_x509_crt_t type

       const char * oid
                   holds an Object Identified in null terminated string

       unsigned indx
                   In case multiple same OIDs exist in the RDN, this specifies which to send. Use (0) to get the first one.

       unsigned int raw_flag
                   If non-zero returns the raw DER data of the DN part.

       void * buf  a pointer where the DN part will be copied (may be null).

       size_t * buf_size
                   initially holds the size of  buf

DESCRIPTION
       This  function  will  extract  the part of the name of the Certificate subject specified by the given OID. The output, if the raw flag is not used, will be encoded as described in RFC4514. Thus a
       string that is ASCII or UTF-8 encoded, depending on the certificate data.

       Some helper macros with popular OIDs can be found in gnutls/x509.h If raw flag is (0), this function will only return known OIDs as text. Other OIDs will be DER encoded, as described  in  RFC4514
       -- in hex format with a '#' prefix.  You can check about known OIDs using gnutls_x509_dn_oid_known().

       If  buf is null then only the size will be filled. If the  raw_flag is not specified the output is always null terminated, although the
        buf_size will not include the null character.

RETURNS
       GNUTLS_E_SHORT_MEMORY_BUFFER  if  the provided buffer is not long enough, and in that case the  buf_size will be updated with the required size. GNUTLS_E_REQUESTED_DATA_NOT_AVAILABLE if there are
       no data in the current index. On success 0 is returned.
