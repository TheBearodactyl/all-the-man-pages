NAME
       gnutls_transport_set_ptr2 - API function

SYNOPSIS
       #include <gnutls/gnutls.h>

       void gnutls_transport_set_ptr2(gnutls_session_t session, gnutls_transport_ptr_t recv_ptr, gnutls_transport_ptr_t send_ptr);

ARGUMENTS
       gnutls_session_t session
                   is a gnutls_session_t type.

       gnutls_transport_ptr_t recv_ptr
                   is the value for the pull function

       gnutls_transport_ptr_t send_ptr
                   is the value for the push function

DESCRIPTION
       Used to set the first argument of the transport function (for push and pull callbacks). In berkeley style sockets this function will set the connection descriptor.  With this function you can use
       two different pointers for receiving and sending.
