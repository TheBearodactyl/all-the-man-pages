NAME
       gnutls_x509_privkey_verify_seed - API function

SYNOPSIS
       #include <gnutls/x509.h>

       int gnutls_x509_privkey_verify_seed(gnutls_x509_privkey_t key, gnutls_digest_algorithm_t digest, const void * seed, size_t seed_size);

ARGUMENTS
       gnutls_x509_privkey_t key
                   should contain a gnutls_x509_privkey_t type

       gnutls_digest_algorithm_t digest
                   it contains the digest algorithm used for key generation (if applicable)

       const void * seed
                   the seed of the key to be checked with

       size_t seed_size
                   holds the size of  seed

DESCRIPTION
       This function will verify that the given private key was generated from the provided seed. If  seed is NULL then the seed stored in the  key 's structure will be used for verification.

RETURNS
       In case of a verification failure GNUTLS_E_PRIVKEY_VERIFICATION_ERROR is returned, and zero or positive code on success.

SINCE
       3.5.0
