PCRE2_JIT_MATCH(3)         Library Functions Manual         PCRE2_JIT_MATCH(3)

NAME
       PCRE2 - Perl-compatible regular expressions (revised API)

SYNOPSIS

       #include <pcre2.h>

       int pcre2_jit_match(const pcre2_code *code, PCRE2_SPTR subject,
         PCRE2_SIZE length, PCRE2_SIZE startoffset,
         uint32_t options, pcre2_match_data *match_data,
         pcre2_match_context *mcontext);

DESCRIPTION

       This  function matches a compiled regular expression that has been suc‐
       cessfully processed by the JIT compiler against a given subject string,
       using  a  matching  algorithm  that is similar to Perl's. It is a "fast
       path" interface to JIT, and it bypasses some of the sanity checks  that
       pcre2_match()  applies.   Its  arguments  are  exactly  the same as for
       pcre2_match(), except that the subject string must be specified with  a
       length; PCRE2_ZERO_TERMINATED is not supported.

       The  supported  options are PCRE2_NOTBOL, PCRE2_NOTEOL, PCRE2_NOTEMPTY,
       PCRE2_NOTEMPTY_ATSTART, PCRE2_PARTIAL_HARD, and PCRE2_PARTIAL_SOFT. Un‐
       supported  options  are  ignored. The subject string is not checked for
       UTF validity.

       The return values are the same  as  for  pcre2_match()  plus  PCRE2_ER‐
       ROR_JIT_BADOPTION if a matching mode (partial or complete) is requested
       that was not  compiled.  For  details  of  partial  matching,  see  the
       pcre2partial page.

       There is a complete description of the PCRE2 native API in the pcre2api
       page and a description of the JIT API in the pcre2jit page.
