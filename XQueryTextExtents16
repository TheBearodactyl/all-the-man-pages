NAME
       XTextExtents, XTextExtents16, XQueryTextExtents, XQueryTextExtents16 - compute or query text extents

SYNTAX
       int XTextExtents(XFontStruct *font_struct, _Xconst char *string, int nchars, int *direction_return, int *font_ascent_return, int *font_descent_return, XCharStruct *overall_return);

       int XTextExtents16(XFontStruct *font_struct, _Xconst XChar2b *string, int nchars, int *direction_return, int *font_ascent_return, int *font_descent_return, XCharStruct *overall_return);

       int XQueryTextExtents(Display *display, XID font_ID, _Xconst char *string, int nchars, int *direction_return, int *font_ascent_return, int *font_descent_return, XCharStruct *overall_return);

       int XQueryTextExtents16(Display *display, XID font_ID, _Xconst XChar2b *string, int nchars, int *direction_return, int *font_ascent_return, int *font_descent_return, XCharStruct *overall_return);

ARGUMENTS
       direction_return
                 Returns the value of the direction hint (FontLeftToRight or FontRightToLeft).

       display   Specifies the connection to the X server.

       font_ID   Specifies either the font ID or the GContext ID that contains the font.

       font_ascent_return
                 Returns the font ascent.

       font_descent_return
                 Returns the font descent.

       font_struct
                 Specifies the XFontStruct structure.

       nchars    Specifies the number of characters in the character string.

       string    Specifies the character string.

       overall_return
                 Returns the overall size in the specified XCharStruct structure.

DESCRIPTION
       The XTextExtents and XTextExtents16 functions perform the size computation locally and, thereby, avoid the round-trip overhead of XQueryTextExtents and XQueryTextExtents16.  Both functions return
       an XCharStruct structure, whose members are set to the values as follows.

       The ascent member is set to the maximum of the ascent metrics of all characters in the string.  The descent member is set to the maximum of the descent metrics.  The width member is  set  to  the
       sum  of  the  character-width  metrics  of  all  characters in the string.  For each character in the string, let W be the sum of the character-width metrics of all characters preceding it in the
       string.  Let L be the left-side-bearing metric of the character plus W.  Let R be the right-side-bearing metric of the character plus W.  The lbearing member is set to the minimum L of all  char‐
       acters in the string.  The rbearing member is set to the maximum R.

       For  fonts  defined  with linear indexing rather than 2-byte matrix indexing, each XChar2b structure is interpreted as a 16-bit number with byte1 as the most significant byte.  If the font has no
       defined default character, undefined characters in the string are taken to have all zero metrics.

       The XQueryTextExtents and XQueryTextExtents16 functions return the bounding box of the specified 8-bit and 16-bit character string in the specified font or the font contained in the specified GC.
       These functions query the X server and, therefore, suffer the round-trip overhead that is avoided by XTextExtents and XTextExtents16.  Both functions return a XCharStruct structure, whose members
       are set to the values as follows.

       The ascent member is set to the maximum of the ascent metrics of all characters in the string.  The descent member is set to the maximum of the descent metrics.  The width member is  set  to  the
       sum  of  the  character-width  metrics  of  all  characters in the string.  For each character in the string, let W be the sum of the character-width metrics of all characters preceding it in the
       string.  Let L be the left-side-bearing metric of the character plus W.  Let R be the right-side-bearing metric of the character plus W.  The lbearing member is set to the minimum L of all  char‐
       acters in the string.  The rbearing member is set to the maximum R.

       For  fonts  defined  with linear indexing rather than 2-byte matrix indexing, each XChar2b structure is interpreted as a 16-bit number with byte1 as the most significant byte.  If the font has no
       defined default character, undefined characters in the string are taken to have all zero metrics.

       Characters with all zero metrics are ignored.  If the font has no defined default_char, the undefined characters in the string are also ignored.

       XQueryTextExtents and XQueryTextExtents16 can generate BadFont and BadGC errors.

DIAGNOSTICS
       BadFont   A value for a Font or GContext argument does not name a defined Font.

       BadGC     A value for a GContext argument does not name a defined GContext.
