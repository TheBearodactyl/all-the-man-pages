OSSL_STORE_EXPECT(3ssl)             OpenSSL            OSSL_STORE_EXPECT(3ssl)

NAME
       OSSL_STORE_expect, OSSL_STORE_supports_search, OSSL_STORE_find -
       Specify what object type is expected

SYNOPSIS
        #include <openssl/store.h>

        int OSSL_STORE_expect(OSSL_STORE_CTX *ctx, int expected_type);

        int OSSL_STORE_supports_search(OSSL_STORE_CTX *ctx, int criterion_type);

        int OSSL_STORE_find(OSSL_STORE_CTX *ctx, OSSL_STORE_SEARCH *search);

DESCRIPTION
       OSSL_STORE_expect() helps applications filter what OSSL_STORE_load()
       returns by specifying a OSSL_STORE_INFO type.  By default, no
       expectations on the types of objects to be loaded are made.
       expected_type may be 0 to indicate explicitly that no expectation is
       made, or it may be any of the known object types (see "SUPPORTED
       OBJECTS" in OSSL_STORE_INFO(3)) except for OSSL_STORE_INFO_NAME.  For
       example, if "file:/foo/bar/store.pem" contains several objects of
       different type and only certificates are interesting, the application
       can simply say that it expects the type OSSL_STORE_INFO_CERT.

       OSSL_STORE_find() helps applications specify a criterion for a more
       fine grained search of objects.

       OSSL_STORE_supports_search() checks if the loader of the given
       OSSL_STORE context supports the given search type.  See "SUPPORTED
       CRITERION TYPES" in OSSL_STORE_SEARCH(3) for information on the
       supported search criterion types.

       OSSL_STORE_expect() and OSSL_STORE_find must be called before the first
       OSSL_STORE_load() of a given session, or they will fail.

NOTES
       If a more elaborate filter is required by the application, a better
       choice would be to use a post-processing function.  See
       OSSL_STORE_open(3) for more information.

       However, some loaders may take advantage of the knowledge of an
       expected type to make object retrieval more efficient, so if a single
       type is expected, this method is usually preferable.

RETURN VALUES
       OSSL_STORE_expect() returns 1 on success, or 0 on failure.

       OSSL_STORE_supports_search() returns 1 if the criterion is supported,
       or 0 otherwise.

       OSSL_STORE_find() returns 1 on success, or 0 on failure.
