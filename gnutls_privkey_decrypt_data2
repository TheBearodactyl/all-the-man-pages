NAME
       gnutls_privkey_decrypt_data2 - API function

SYNOPSIS
       #include <gnutls/abstract.h>

       int gnutls_privkey_decrypt_data2(gnutls_privkey_t key, unsigned int flags, const gnutls_datum_t * ciphertext, unsigned char * plaintext, size_t plaintext_size);

ARGUMENTS
       gnutls_privkey_t key
                   Holds the key

       unsigned int flags
                   zero for now

       const gnutls_datum_t * ciphertext
                   holds the data to be decrypted

       unsigned char * plaintext
                   a preallocated buffer that will be filled with the plaintext

       size_t plaintext_size
                   in/out size of the plaintext

DESCRIPTION
       This  function  will decrypt the given data using the algorithm supported by the private key. Unlike with gnutls_privkey_decrypt_data() this function operates in constant time and constant memory
       access.

RETURNS
       On success, GNUTLS_E_SUCCESS (0) is returned, otherwise a negative error value.

SINCE
       3.6.5
