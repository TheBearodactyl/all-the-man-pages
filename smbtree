DESCRIPTION
       This tool is part of the samba(7) suite.

       smbtree is a smb browser program in text mode. It is similar to the
       "Network Neighborhood" found on Windows computers. It prints a tree
       with all the known domains, the servers in those domains and the shares
       on the servers.

OPTIONS
       -D|--domains
           Only print a list of all the domains known on broadcast or by the
           master browser

       -S|--servers
           Only print a list of all the domains and servers responding on
           broadcast or known by the master browser.

       -?|--help
           Print a summary of command line options.

       --usage
           Display brief usage message.

       -d|--debuglevel=DEBUGLEVEL
           level is an integer from 0 to 10. The default value if this
           parameter is not specified is 1 for client applications.

           The higher this value, the more detail will be logged to the log
           files about the activities of the server. At level 0, only critical
           errors and serious warnings will be logged. Level 1 is a reasonable
           level for day-to-day running - it generates a small amount of
           information about operations carried out.

           Levels above 1 will generate considerable amounts of log data, and
           should only be used when investigating a problem. Levels above 3
           are designed for use only by developers and generate HUGE amounts
           of log data, most of which is extremely cryptic.

           Note that specifying this parameter here will override the log
           level parameter in the /etc/samba/smb.conf file.

       --debug-stdout
           This will redirect debug output to STDOUT. By default all clients
           are logging to STDERR.

       --configfile=<configuration file>
           The file specified contains the configuration details required by
           the client. The information in this file can be general for client
           and server or only provide client specific like options such as
           client smb encrypt. See /etc/samba/smb.conf for more information.
           The default configuration file name is determined at compile time.

       --option=<name>=<value>
           Set the smb.conf(5) option "<name>" to value "<value>" from the
           command line. This overrides compiled-in defaults and options read
           from the configuration file. If a name or a value includes a space,
           wrap whole --option=name=value into quotes.

       -l|--log-basename=logdirectory
           Base directory name for log/debug files. The extension ".progname"
           will be appended (e.g. log.smbclient, log.smbd, etc...). The log
           file is never removed by the client.

       --leak-report
           Enable talloc leak reporting on exit.

       --leak-report-full
           Enable full talloc leak reporting on exit.

       -V|--version
           Prints the program version number.

       -U|--user=[DOMAIN\]USERNAME[%PASSWORD]
           Sets the SMB username or username and password.

           If %PASSWORD is not specified, the user will be prompted. The
           client will first check the USER environment variable (which is
           also permitted to also contain the password separated by a %), then
           the LOGNAME variable (which is not permitted to contain a password)
           and if either exists, the value is used. If these environmental
           variables are not found, the username found in a Kerberos
           Credentials cache may be used.

           A third option is to use a credentials file which contains the
           plaintext of the username and password. This option is mainly
           provided for scripts where the admin does not wish to pass the
           credentials on the command line or via environment variables. If
           this method is used, make certain that the permissions on the file
           restrict access from unwanted users. See the -A for more details.

           Be cautious about including passwords in scripts or passing
           user-supplied values onto the command line. For security it is
           better to let the Samba client tool ask for the password if needed,
           or obtain the password once with kinit.

           While Samba will attempt to scrub the password from the process
           title (as seen in ps), this is after startup and so is subject to a
           race.

       -N|--no-pass
           If specified, this parameter suppresses the normal password prompt
           from the client to the user. This is useful when accessing a
           service that does not require a password.

           Unless a password is specified on the command line or this
           parameter is specified, the client will request a password.

           If a password is specified on the command line and this option is
           also defined the password on the command line will be silently
           ignored and no password will be used.

       --password
           Specify the password on the commandline.

           Be cautious about including passwords in scripts or passing
           user-supplied values onto the command line. For security it is
           better to let the Samba client tool ask for the password if needed,
           or obtain the password once with kinit.

           If --password is not specified, the tool will check the PASSWD
           environment variable, followed by PASSWD_FD which is expected to
           contain an open file descriptor (FD) number.

           Finally it will check PASSWD_FILE (containing a file path to be
           opened). The file should only contain the password. Make certain
           that the permissions on the file restrict access from unwanted
           users!

           While Samba will attempt to scrub the password from the process
           title (as seen in ps), this is after startup and so is subject to a
           race.

       --pw-nt-hash
           The supplied password is the NT hash.

       -A|--authentication-file=filename
           This option allows you to specify a file from which to read the
           username and password used in the connection. The format of the
           file is:

                                   username = <value>
                                   password = <value>
                                   domain   = <value>

           Make certain that the permissions on the file restrict access from
           unwanted users!

       -P|--machine-pass
           Use stored machine account password.

       --simple-bind-dn=DN
           DN to use for a simple bind.

       --use-kerberos=desired|required|off
           This parameter determines whether Samba client tools will try to
           authenticate using Kerberos. For Kerberos authentication you need
           to use dns names instead of IP addresses when connecting to a
           service.

           Note that specifying this parameter here will override the client
           use kerberos parameter in the /etc/samba/smb.conf file.

       --use-krb5-ccache=CCACHE
           Specifies the credential cache location for Kerberos
           authentication.

           This will set --use-kerberos=required too.

       --use-winbind-ccache
           Try to use the credential cache by winbind.

       --client-protection=sign|encrypt|off
           Sets the connection protection the client tool should use.

           Note that specifying this parameter here will override the client
           protection parameter in the /etc/samba/smb.conf file.

           In case you need more fine grained control you can use:
           --option=clientsmbencrypt=OPTION, --option=clientipcsigning=OPTION,
           --option=clientsigning=OPTION.
