NAME
       CURLOPT_RANDOM_FILE - file to read random data from

SYNOPSIS
       #include <curl/curl.h>

       CURLcode curl_easy_setopt(CURL *handle, CURLOPT_RANDOM_FILE, char *path);

DESCRIPTION
       Deprecated option. It serves no purpose anymore.

       Pass a char * to a null-terminated file name. The file might be used to read from to seed the random engine for SSL and more.

       The application does not have to keep the string around after setting this option.

DEFAULT
       NULL, not used

PROTOCOLS
       All

EXAMPLE
       CURL *curl = curl_easy_init();
       if(curl) {
         curl_easy_setopt(curl, CURLOPT_URL, "https://example.com/");
         curl_easy_setopt(curl, CURLOPT_RANDOM_FILE, "junk.txt");
         ret = curl_easy_perform(curl);
         curl_easy_cleanup(curl);
       }

AVAILABILITY
       If built with TLS enabled. Only the OpenSSL backend will use this, and only with OpenSSL versions before 1.1.0.

       This option was deprecated in 7.84.0.

RETURN VALUE
       Returns CURLE_OK on success or CURLE_OUT_OF_MEMORY if there was insufficient heap space.
