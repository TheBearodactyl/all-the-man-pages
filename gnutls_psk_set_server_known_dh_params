NAME
       gnutls_psk_set_server_known_dh_params - API function

SYNOPSIS
       #include <gnutls/gnutls.h>

ARGUMENTS
       gnutls_psk_server_credentials_t res
                   is a gnutls_psk_server_credentials_t type

       gnutls_sec_param_t sec_param
                   is an option of the gnutls_sec_param_t enumeration

DESCRIPTION
       This  function  will  set the Diffie-Hellman parameters for a PSK server to use. These parameters will be used in Ephemeral Diffie-Hellman cipher suites and will be selected from the FFDHE set of
       RFC7919 according to the security level provided.
