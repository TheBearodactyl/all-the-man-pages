NAME
       XkbGetKeyBehaviors - Obtain the behaviors (the behaviors array) for a subset of the keys in a keyboard description from the server

SYNOPSIS
       Status XkbGetKeyBehaviors (Display *dpy, unsigned int first, unsigned int num, XkbDescPtr xkb);

ARGUMENTS
       dpy    connection to server

       first  keycode of first key to get

       num    number of keys for which behaviors are desired

       xkb    Xkb description to contain the result

DESCRIPTION
       XkbGetKeyBehaviors sends a request to the server to obtain the behaviors for num keys on the keyboard starting with the key whose keycode is first.  It waits for a reply and returns the behaviors
       in the server->behaviors field of xkb.  If successful, XkbGetKeyBehaviors returns Success.

       If the server map in the xkb parameter has not been allocated, XkbGetKeyBehaviors allocates and initializes it before obtaining the actions.

       If the server does not have a compatible version of Xkb, or the Xkb extension has not been properly initialized, XkbGetKeyBehaviors returns BadAccess. If num is less than 1 or greater  than  Xkb‚Äê
       MaxKeyCount, XkbGetKeyBehaviors returns BadValue. If any allocation errors occur, XkbGetKeyBehaviors returns BadAlloc.

DIAGNOSTICS

       BadAlloc       Unable to allocate storage

       BadValue       An argument is out of range
