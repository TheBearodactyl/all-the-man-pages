NAME
       gnutls_pkcs11_reinit - API function

SYNOPSIS
       #include <gnutls/pkcs11.h>

       int gnutls_pkcs11_reinit( void);

ARGUMENTS
        void

DESCRIPTION
       This function will reinitialize the PKCS 11 subsystem in gnutls.  This is required by PKCS 11 when an application uses fork(). The reinitialization function must be called on the child.

       Note that since GnuTLS 3.3.0, the reinitialization of the PKCS 11 subsystem occurs automatically after fork.

RETURNS
       On success, GNUTLS_E_SUCCESS (0) is returned, otherwise a negative error value.

SINCE
       3.0
