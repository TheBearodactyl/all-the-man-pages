NAME
     acl_from_mode — create an ACL from file permission bits

LIBRARY
     Linux Access Control Lists library (libacl, -lacl).

SYNOPSIS
     #include <sys/types.h>
     #include <acl/libacl.h>

     acl_t
     acl_from_mode(mode_t mode);

DESCRIPTION
     The acl_from_mode() function creates a minimal ACL that contains the three entries with tag types ACL_USER_OBJ, ACL_GROUP_OBJ, and ACL_OTHER, with permissions corresponding to the owner, group, and
     other permission bits of its argument mode.

RETURN VALUE
     On success, this function returns a pointer to the working storage. On error, a value of (acl_t)NULL is returned, and errno is set appropriately.

ERRORS
     If any of the following conditions occur, the acl_from_mode() function returns a value of (acl_t)NULL and sets errno to the corresponding value:

     [ENOMEM]           The ACL working storage requires more memory than is allowed by the hardware or system-imposed memory management constraints.

STANDARDS
     This is a non-portable, Linux specific extension to the ACL manipulation functions defined in IEEE Std 1003.1e draft 17 (“POSIX.1e”, abandoned).
