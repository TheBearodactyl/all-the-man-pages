NAME
       CURLOPT_CAPATH - directory holding CA certificates

SYNOPSIS
       #include <curl/curl.h>

       CURLcode curl_easy_setopt(CURL *handle, CURLOPT_CAPATH, char *capath);

DESCRIPTION
       Pass  a char * to a null-terminated string naming a directory holding multiple CA certificates to verify the peer with. If libcurl is built against OpenSSL, the certificate directory must be pre‚Äê
       pared using the OpenSSL c_rehash utility.  This makes sense only when used in combination with the CURLOPT_SSL_VERIFYPEER(3) option.

       The CURLOPT_CAPATH(3) function apparently does not work in Windows due to some limitation in OpenSSL.

       The application does not have to keep the string around after setting this option.

       The default value for this can be figured out with CURLINFO_CAPATH(3).

DEFAULT
       A default path detected at build time.

PROTOCOLS
       All TLS based protocols: HTTPS, FTPS, IMAPS, POP3S, SMTPS etc.

EXAMPLE
       CURL *curl = curl_easy_init();
       if(curl) {
         curl_easy_setopt(curl, CURLOPT_URL, "https://example.com/");
         curl_easy_setopt(curl, CURLOPT_CAPATH, "/etc/cert-dir");
         ret = curl_easy_perform(curl);
         curl_easy_cleanup(curl);
       }

AVAILABILITY
       This option is supported by the OpenSSL, GnuTLS and mbedTLS (since 7.56.0) backends. The NSS backend provides the option only for backward compatibility.

RETURN VALUE
       CURLE_OK if supported; or an error such as:

       CURLE_NOT_BUILT_IN - Not supported by the SSL backend

       CURLE_UNKNOWN_OPTION

       CURLE_OUT_OF_MEMORY
