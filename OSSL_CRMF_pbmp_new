OSSL_CRMF_PBMP_NEW(3ssl)            OpenSSL           OSSL_CRMF_PBMP_NEW(3ssl)

NAME
       OSSL_CRMF_pbm_new, OSSL_CRMF_pbmp_new - functions for producing
       Password-Based MAC (PBM)

SYNOPSIS
        #include <openssl/crmf.h>

        int OSSL_CRMF_pbm_new(OSSL_LIB_CTX *libctx, const char *propq,
                              const OSSL_CRMF_PBMPARAMETER *pbmp,
                              const unsigned char *msg, size_t msglen,
                              const unsigned char *sec, size_t seclen,
                              unsigned char **mac, size_t *maclen);

        OSSL_CRMF_PBMPARAMETER *OSSL_CRMF_pbmp_new(OSSL_LIB_CTX *libctx, size_t saltlen,
                                                   int owfnid, size_t itercnt,
                                                   int macnid);

DESCRIPTION
       OSSL_CRMF_pbm_new() generates a PBM (Password-Based MAC) based on given
       PBM parameters pbmp, message msg, and secret sec, along with the
       respective lengths msglen and seclen.  The optional library context
       libctx and propq parameters may be used to influence the selection of
       the MAC algorithm referenced in the pbmp; see "ALGORITHM FETCHING" in
       crypto(7) for further information.  On success writes the address of
       the newly allocated MAC via the mac reference parameter and writes the
       length via the maclen reference parameter unless it its NULL.

       OSSL_CRMF_pbmp_new() initializes and returns a new PBMParameter
       structure with a new random salt of given length saltlen, OWF (one-way
       function) NID owfnid, OWF iteration count itercnt, and MAC NID macnid.
       The library context libctx parameter may be used to select the provider
       for the random number generation (DRBG) and may be NULL for the
       default.

NOTES
       The algorithms for the OWF (one-way function) and for the MAC (message
       authentication code) may be any with a NID defined in
       <openssl/objects.h>.  As specified by RFC 4210, these should include
       NID_hmac_sha1.

       RFC 4210 recommends that the salt SHOULD be at least 8 bytes (64 bits)
       long, where 16 bytes is common.

       The iteration count must be at least 100, as stipulated by RFC 4211,
       and is limited to at most 100000 to avoid DoS through manipulated or
       otherwise malformed input.

RETURN VALUES
       OSSL_CRMF_pbm_new() returns 1 on success, 0 on error.

       OSSL_CRMF_pbmp_new() returns a new and initialized
       OSSL_CRMF_PBMPARAMETER structure, or NULL on error.

EXAMPLES
        OSSL_CRMF_PBMPARAMETER *pbm = NULL;
        unsigned char *msg = "Hello";
        unsigned char *sec = "SeCrEt";
        unsigned char *mac = NULL;
        size_t maclen;

        if ((pbm = OSSL_CRMF_pbmp_new(16, NID_sha256, 500, NID_hmac_sha1) == NULL))
            goto err;
        if (!OSSL_CRMF_pbm_new(pbm, msg, 5, sec, 6, &mac, &maclen))
            goto err;
