Detailed Description
       Class defining one-dimensional subset of an array.

       The slice class represents a one-dimensional subset of an array,
       specified by three parameters: start offset, size, and stride. The
       start offset is the index of the first element of the array that is
       part of the subset. The size is the total number of elements in the
       subset. Stride is the distance between each successive array element to
       include in the subset.

       For example, with an array of size 10, and a slice with offset 1, size
       3 and stride 2, the subset consists of array elements 1, 3, and 5.
