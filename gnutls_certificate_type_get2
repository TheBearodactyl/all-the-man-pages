NAME
       gnutls_certificate_type_get2 - API function

SYNOPSIS
       #include <gnutls/gnutls.h>

       gnutls_certificate_type_t gnutls_certificate_type_get2(gnutls_session_t session, gnutls_ctype_target_t target);

ARGUMENTS
       gnutls_session_t session
                   is a gnutls_session_t type.

       gnutls_ctype_target_t target
                   is a gnutls_ctype_target_t type.

DESCRIPTION
       This  function  returns the type of the certificate that a side is negotiated to use.  The certificate type is by default X.509, unless an alternative certificate type is enabled by gnutls_init()
       and negotiated during the session.

       The  target parameter specifies whether to request the negotiated certificate type for the client (GNUTLS_CTYPE_CLIENT), or for the server (GNUTLS_CTYPE_SERVER). Additionally, in P2P mode connec‐
       tion  set  up where you don't know in advance who will be client and who will be server you can use the flag (GNUTLS_CTYPE_OURS) and (GNUTLS_CTYPE_PEERS) to retrieve the corresponding certificate
       types.

       Resumed sessions will return the certificate type that was negotiated and used in the original session. That is, this function can be used to reliably determine the type of  the  certificate  re‐
       turned by gnutls_certificate_get_peers().

RETURNS
       the currently used gnutls_certificate_type_t certificate type for the client or the server.

SINCE
       3.6.4
