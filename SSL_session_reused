SSL_SESSION_REUSED(3ssl)            OpenSSL           SSL_SESSION_REUSED(3ssl)

NAME
       SSL_session_reused - query whether a reused session was negotiated
       during handshake

SYNOPSIS
        #include <openssl/ssl.h>

        int SSL_session_reused(const SSL *ssl);

DESCRIPTION
       Query, whether a reused session was negotiated during the handshake.

NOTES
       During the negotiation, a client can propose to reuse a session. The
       server then looks up the session in its cache. If both client and
       server agree on the session, it will be reused and a flag is being set
       that can be queried by the application.

RETURN VALUES
       The following return values can occur:

       0   A new session was negotiated.

       1   A session was reused.
