NAME
       ares_parse_soa_reply - Parse a reply to a DNS query of type SOA

SYNOPSIS
       #include <ares.h>

       int ares_parse_soa_reply(const unsigned char* abuf, int alen,
                                struct ares_soa_reply** soa_out);

DESCRIPTION
       The  ares_parse_soa_reply  function parses the response to a query of type SOA into a struct ares_soa_reply.  The parameters abuf and alen give the contents of the response.  The result is stored
       in allocated memory and a pointer to it stored into the variable pointed to by soa_out.  It is the caller's responsibility to free the resulting soa_out structure when it is no longer needed  us‚Äê
       ing the function ares_free_data

       The structure ares_soa_reply contains the following fields:

           struct ares_soa_reply {
                char *nsname;
                char *hostmaster;
                unsigned int serial;
                unsigned int refresh;
                unsigned int retry;
                unsigned int expire;
                unsigned int minttl;
           };

RETURN VALUES
       ares_parse_soa_reply can return any of the following values:

       ARES_SUCCESS   The response was successfully parsed.

       ARES_EBADRESP  The response was malformatted.

       ARES_ENODATA   The response did not contain an answer to the query.

       ARES_ENOMEM    Memory was exhausted.
