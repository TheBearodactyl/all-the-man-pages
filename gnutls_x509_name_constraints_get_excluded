NAME
       gnutls_x509_name_constraints_get_excluded - API function

SYNOPSIS
       #include <gnutls/x509.h>

       int gnutls_x509_name_constraints_get_excluded(gnutls_x509_name_constraints_t nc, unsigned idx, unsigned * type, gnutls_datum_t * name);

ARGUMENTS
       gnutls_x509_name_constraints_t nc
                   the extracted name constraints

       unsigned idx
                   the index of the constraint

       unsigned * type
                   the type of the constraint (of type gnutls_x509_subject_alt_name_t)

       gnutls_datum_t * name
                   the name in the constraint (of the specific type)

DESCRIPTION
       This  function will return an intermediate type containing the name constraints of the provided CA certificate. That structure can be used in combination with gnutls_x509_name_constraints_check()
       to verify whether a server's name is in accordance with the constraints.

       The name should be treated as constant and valid for the lifetime of  nc .

RETURNS
       On success, GNUTLS_E_SUCCESS (0) is returned, GNUTLS_E_REQUESTED_DATA_NOT_AVAILABLE if the extension is not present, otherwise a negative error value.

SINCE
       3.3.0
