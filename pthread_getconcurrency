NAME
       pthread_setconcurrency,  pthread_getconcurrency  -  set/get the concur‐
       rency level

LIBRARY
       POSIX threads library (libpthread, -lpthread)

SYNOPSIS
       #include <pthread.h>

       int pthread_setconcurrency(int new_level);
       int pthread_getconcurrency(void);

DESCRIPTION
       The pthread_setconcurrency() function informs the implementation of the
       application's  desired  concurrency level, specified in new_level.  The
       implementation takes this only as a hint: POSIX.1 does not specify  the
       level  of  concurrency  that  should be provided as a result of calling
       pthread_setconcurrency().

       Specifying new_level as 0 instructs the implementation  to  manage  the
       concurrency level as it deems appropriate.

       pthread_getconcurrency()  returns  the current value of the concurrency
       level for this process.

RETURN VALUE
       On success, pthread_setconcurrency() returns 0; on error, it returns  a
       nonzero error number.

       pthread_getconcurrency()  always  succeeds,  returning  the concurrency
       level set by a previous call  to  pthread_setconcurrency(),  or  0,  if
       pthread_setconcurrency() has not previously been called.

ERRORS
       pthread_setconcurrency() can fail with the following error:

       EINVAL new_level is negative.

       POSIX.1  also  documents  an  EAGAIN  error  ("the  value  specified by
       new_level would cause a system resource to be exceeded").

STANDARDS
       POSIX.1-2008.

HISTORY
       glibc 2.1.  POSIX.1-2001.

NOTES
       The default concurrency level is 0.

       Concurrency levels are meaningful only for  M:N  threading  implementa‐
       tions,  where  at  any moment a subset of a process's set of user-level
       threads may be bound to a smaller number of kernel-scheduling entities.
       Setting the concurrency level allows the application to give the system
       a hint as to the number of kernel-scheduling entities  that  should  be
       provided for efficient execution of the application.

       Both  LinuxThreads  and NPTL are 1:1 threading implementations, so set‐
       ting the concurrency level has no meaning.  In other  words,  on  Linux
       these  functions merely exist for compatibility with other systems, and
       they have no effect on the execution of a program.

PROLOG
       This  manual  page is part of the POSIX Programmer's Manual.  The Linux
       implementation of this interface may differ (consult the  corresponding
       Linux  manual page for details of Linux behavior), or the interface may
       not be implemented on Linux.

NAME
       pthread_getconcurrency, pthread_setconcurrency — get and set the  level
       of concurrency

SYNOPSIS
       #include <pthread.h>

       int pthread_getconcurrency(void);
       int pthread_setconcurrency(int new_level);

DESCRIPTION
       Unbound  threads in a process may or may not be required to be simulta‐
       neously active. By default, the threads implementation ensures  that  a
       sufficient  number  of  threads are active so that the process can con‐
       tinue to make progress. While this conserves system resources,  it  may
       not produce the most effective level of concurrency.

       The  pthread_setconcurrency()  function allows an application to inform
       the threads implementation of its desired concurrency level, new_level.
       The actual level of concurrency provided by the implementation as a re‐
       sult of this function call is unspecified.

       If new_level is zero, it causes the implementation to maintain the con‐
       currency  level  at  its  discretion as if pthread_setconcurrency() had
       never been called.

       The pthread_getconcurrency() function shall return the value set  by  a
       previous   call   to  the  pthread_setconcurrency()  function.  If  the
       pthread_setconcurrency() function was not previously called, this func‐
       tion shall return zero to indicate that the implementation is maintain‐
       ing the concurrency level.

       A call to pthread_setconcurrency() shall inform the  implementation  of
       its  desired concurrency level.  The implementation shall use this as a
       hint, not a requirement.

       If an implementation does not support multiplexing of user  threads  on
       top  of several kernel-scheduled entities, the pthread_setconcurrency()
       and pthread_getconcurrency() functions are  provided  for  source  code
       compatibility  but  they  shall have no effect when called. To maintain
       the  function  semantics,  the  new_level  parameter  is   saved   when
       pthread_setconcurrency()  is  called  so  that  a  subsequent  call  to
       pthread_getconcurrency() shall return the same value.

RETURN VALUE
       If successful, the pthread_setconcurrency() function shall return zero;
       otherwise, an error number shall be returned to indicate the error.

       The  pthread_getconcurrency()  function shall always return the concur‐
       rency level set by a previous call to pthread_setconcurrency().  If the
       pthread_setconcurrency()  function  has never been called, pthread_get‐
       concurrency() shall return zero.

ERRORS
       The pthread_setconcurrency() function shall fail if:

       EINVAL The value specified by new_level is negative.

       EAGAIN The value specified by new_level would cause a  system  resource
              to be exceeded.

       The pthread_setconcurrency() function shall not return an error code of
       [EINTR].

EXAMPLES
       None.

APPLICATION USAGE
       Application developers should note that an  implementation  can  always
       ignore  any calls to pthread_setconcurrency() and return a constant for
       pthread_getconcurrency().  For this reason, it is not recommended  that
       portable applications use this function.

RATIONALE
       None.

FUTURE DIRECTIONS
       These functions may be removed in a future version.
