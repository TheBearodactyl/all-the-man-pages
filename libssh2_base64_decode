NAME
       libssh2_base64_decode - decode a base64 encoded string

SYNOPSIS
       #include <libssh2.h>

       int libssh2_base64_decode(LIBSSH2_SESSION *session, char **dest,
                                 unsigned int *dest_len, const char *src,
                                 unsigned int src_len);

DESCRIPTION
       This function is deemed DEPRECATED and will be removed from libssh2 in a future version. Don't use it!

       Decode a base64 chunk and store it into a newly allocated buffer. 'dest_len' will be set to hold the length of the returned buffer that '*dest' will point to.

       The returned buffer is allocated by this function, but it is not clear how to free that memory!

BUGS
       The memory that *dest points to is allocated by the malloc function libssh2 uses, but there's no way for an application to free this data in a safe and reliable way!

RETURN VALUE
       0 if successful, -1 if any error occurred.
