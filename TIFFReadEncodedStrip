NAME
       TIFFReadEncodedStrip - read and decode a strip of data from an open TIFF file

SYNOPSIS
          #include <tiffio.h>

       tmsize_t TIFFReadEncodedStrip(TIFF *tif, uint32_t strip, void *buf, tmsize_t size)

DESCRIPTION
       Read the specified strip of data and place up to size bytes of decompressed information in the (user supplied) data buffer.

NOTES
       The  value  of strip is a “raw strip number”.  That is, the caller must take into account whether or not the data are organized in separate planes (PlanarConfiguration = 2).  To read a full strip
       of data the data buffer should typically be at least as large as the number returned by TIFFStripSize().  If -1 is passed in the size parameter, the whole strip will be read. You should  be  sure
       you have enough space allocated for the buffer.

       The library attempts to hide bit- and byte-ordering differences between the image and the native machine by converting data to the native machine order.  Bit reversal is done if the FillOrder tag
       is opposite to the native machine bit order. 16- and 32-bit samples are automatically byte-swapped if the file was written with a byte order opposite to the native machine byte order.

RETURN VALUES
       The actual number of bytes of data that were placed in buf is returned; TIFFReadEncodedStrip() returns -1 if an error was encountered.

DIAGNOSTICS
       All error messages are directed to the TIFFErrorExtR() routine.
