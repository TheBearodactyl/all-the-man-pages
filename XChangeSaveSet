       XChangeSaveSet can generate BadMatch, BadValue, and BadWindow errors.

       The XAddToSaveSet function adds the specified window to the client's save-set.  The specified window must have been created by some other client, or a BadMatch error results.

       XAddToSaveSet can generate BadMatch and BadWindow errors.

       The XRemoveFromSaveSet function removes the specified window from the client's save-set.  The specified window must have been created by some other client, or a BadMatch error results.

       XRemoveFromSaveSet can generate BadMatch and BadWindow errors.

DIAGNOSTICS
       BadMatch  Some argument or pair of arguments has the correct type and range but fails to match in some other way required by the request.

       BadValue  Some numeric value falls outside the range of values accepted by the request.  Unless a specific range is specified for an argument, the full range defined by the argument's type is ac‚Äê
                 cepted.  Any argument defined as a set of alternatives can generate this error.

       BadWindow A value for a Window argument does not name a defined Window.
