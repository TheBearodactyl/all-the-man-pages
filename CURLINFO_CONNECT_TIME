       CURLcode curl_easy_getinfo(CURL *handle, CURLINFO_CONNECT_TIME, double *timep);

DESCRIPTION
       Pass a pointer to a double to receive the total time in seconds from the start until the connection to the remote host (or proxy) was completed.

         res = curl_easy_perform(curl);
         if(CURLE_OK == res) {
           res = curl_easy_getinfo(curl, CURLINFO_CONNECT_TIME, &connect);
           if(CURLE_OK == res) {
