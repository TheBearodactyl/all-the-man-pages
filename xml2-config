NAME
       xml2-config - script to get information about the installed version of libxml2

SYNOPSIS
       xml2-config [--prefix[=DIR]] [--libs] [--cflags] [--version] [--help]

DESCRIPTION
       xml2-config is a tool that is used to determine the compile and linker flags that should be used to compile and link programs that use libxml2.

OPTIONS
       xml2-config accepts the following options:

       --version
               Print the currently installed version of libxml2 on the standard output.

       --libs  Print the linker flags that are necessary to link a libxml2 program.  Add --dynamic after --libs to print only shared library linking information.

       --cflags
               Print the compiler flags that are necessary to compile a libxml2 program.

       --prefix=PREFIX
               If specified, use PREFIX instead of the installation prefix that libxml2 was built with when computing the output for the --cflags and --libs options. This option must be specified before
               any --libs or --cflags options.
