NAME
       ldns_dnssec_verify_denial, ldns_dnssec_verify_denial_nsec3 - verify denial of existence

SYNOPSIS
       #include <stdint.h>
       #include <stdbool.h>

       #include <ldns/ldns.h>

       ldns_status ldns_dnssec_verify_denial(ldns_rr *rr, ldns_rr_list *nsecs, ldns_rr_list *rrsigs);

       ldns_status ldns_dnssec_verify_denial_nsec3(ldns_rr *rr, ldns_rr_list *nsecs, ldns_rr_list *rrsigs, ldns_pkt_rcode packet_rcode, ldns_rr_type packet_qtype, bool packet_nodata);

DESCRIPTION
       ldns_dnssec_verify_denial() denial is not just a river in egypt

              rr: The (query) RR to check the denial of existence for
              nsecs: The list of NSEC RRs that are supposed to deny the existence of the RR
              rrsigs: The RRSIG RR covering the NSEC RRs
              Returns LDNS_STATUS_OK if the NSEC RRs deny the existence, error code containing the reason they do not otherwise

       ldns_dnssec_verify_denial_nsec3() Denial of existence using NSEC3 records Since NSEC3 is a bit more complicated than normal denial, some context arguments are needed

              rr: The (query) RR to check the denial of existence for
              nsecs: The list of NSEC3 RRs that are supposed to deny the existence of the RR
              rrsigs: The RRSIG rr covering the NSEC RRs
              packet_rcode: The RCODE value of the packet that provided the NSEC3 RRs
              packet_qtype: The original query RR type
              packet_nodata: True if the providing packet had an empty ANSWER section
              Returns LDNS_STATUS_OK if the NSEC3 RRs deny the existence, error code containing the reason they do not otherwise
