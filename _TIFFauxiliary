NAME
       _TIFFauxiliary - auxiliary functions

SYNOPSIS
          #include <tiffio.h>

       uint32_t _TIFFClampDoubleToUInt32(double val)

       uint32_t _TIFFMultiply32(TIFF *tif, uint32_t first, uint32_t second, const char *where)

       uint64_t _TIFFMultiply64(TIFF *tif, uint64_t first, uint64_t second, const char *where)

DESCRIPTION
       _TIFFClampDoubleToUInt32() clamps double values into the range of uint32_t (i.e. 0 .. 0xFFFFFFFF)

       _TIFFMultiply32()  and  _TIFFMultiply64()  checks  for an integer overflow of the multiplication result and return the multiplication result or 0 if an overflow would happen.  The string where is
       printed in the error message in case an overflow happens and can be used to indicate where the function was called.
