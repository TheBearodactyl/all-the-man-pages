       pixmap Specifies the pixmap.

       shapemask
              Specifies the shape mask pixmap.

       attributes

       image  Specifies the image

DESCRIPTION
   XpmCreateDataFromImage
       In  some cases, one may want to create an XPM data from an XImage, to do so use XpmCreateDataFromImage().  The XpmCreateDataFromImage() function exactly works as XpmWriteFileFromImage(3) does and
       returns the same way.  It just writes to a single block malloc’ed data instead of to a file.  It is the caller’s responsibility to free the data, using XpmFree(3) when finished.

   XpmCreateDataFromPixmap
       XpmCreateDataFromPixmap() creates an XPM data from a Pixmap.  The XpmCreateDataFromPixmap() function uses XGetImage(3) to get from the given pixmaps the related X images which are passed to  Xpm‐
       CreateDataFromImage().  Then it destroys the created images using XDestroyImage(3).  XpmCreateDataFromPixmap() returns the same errors as XpmCreateDataFromImage().

   XpmCreateDataFromXpmImage
       XpmCreateDataFromXpmImage() creates an XPM data from an XpmImage.  The XpmCreateDataFromXpmImage() function writes out the given image to a single block malloc’ed data in XPM format.  If insuffi‐
       cient working storage is allocated, it returns XpmNoMemory, and returns XpmSuccess on success.  If the passed XpmInfo structure pointer is not NULL, XpmCreateDataFromXpmImage() looks for the fol‐
       lowing attributes: XpmExtensions, and XpmHotspot, and writes the related information out as well.  It is the caller’s responsibility to free the data, using XpmFree(3) when finished.
