NAME
       CURLOPT_EGDSOCKET - EGD socket path

SYNOPSIS
       #include <curl/curl.h>

       CURLcode curl_easy_setopt(CURL *handle, CURLOPT_EGDSOCKET, char *path);

DESCRIPTION
       Deprecated option. It serves no purpose anymore.

       Pass a char * to the null-terminated path name to the Entropy Gathering Daemon socket. It will be used to seed the random engine for TLS.

       The application does not have to keep the string around after setting this option.

DEFAULT
       NULL

PROTOCOLS
       All TLS based protocols: HTTPS, FTPS, IMAPS, POP3S, SMTPS etc.

EXAMPLE
       CURL *curl = curl_easy_init();
       if(curl) {
         curl_easy_setopt(curl, CURLOPT_URL, "https://example.com/");
         curl_easy_setopt(curl, CURLOPT_EGDSOCKET, "/var/egd.socket");
         ret = curl_easy_perform(curl);
         curl_easy_cleanup(curl);
       }

AVAILABILITY
       If built with TLS enabled. Only the OpenSSL backend will use this, and only with OpenSSL versions before 1.1.0.

       This option was deprecated in 7.84.0.

RETURN VALUE
       Returns CURLE_OK if TLS is supported, CURLE_UNKNOWN_OPTION if not, or CURLE_OUT_OF_MEMORY if there was insufficient heap space.
