NAME
       sd_machine_get_class, sd_machine_get_ifindices - Determine the class
       and network interface indices of a locally running virtual machine or
       container

SYNOPSIS
       #include <systemd/sd-login.h>

       int sd_machine_get_class(const char* machine, char **class);

       int sd_machine_get_ifindices(const char* machine, int **ret_ifindices);

DESCRIPTION
       sd_machine_get_class() may be used to determine the class of a locally
       running virtual machine or container that is registered with systemd-
       machined.service(8). The string returned is either "vm" or "container".
       The returned string needs to be freed with the libc free(3) call after
       use.

       sd_machine_get_ifindices() may be used to determine the numeric indices
       of the network interfaces on the host that are pointing towards the
       specified locally running virtual machine or container. The vm or
       container must be registered with systemd-machined.service(8). The
       output parameter ret_ifindices may be passed as NULL when the output
       value is not needed. The returned array needs to be freed with the libc
       free(3) call after use.

RETURN VALUE
       On success, these functions return a non-negative integer.
       sd_machine_get_ifindices() returns the number of the relevant network
       interfaces. On failure, these calls return a negative errno-style error
       code.

   Errors
       Returned errors may indicate the following problems:

       -ENXIO
           The specified machine does not exist or is currently not running.

       -EINVAL
           An input parameter was invalid (out of range, or NULL, where that
           is not accepted).

       -ENOMEM
           Memory allocation failed.

NOTES
       These APIs are implemented as a shared library, which can be compiled
       and linked to with the libsystemd pkg-config(1) file.
