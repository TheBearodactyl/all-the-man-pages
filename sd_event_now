SD_EVENT_NOW(3)                  sd_event_now                  SD_EVENT_NOW(3)

NAME
       sd_event_now - Retrieve current event loop iteration timestamp

SYNOPSIS
       #include <systemd/sd-event.h>

       int sd_event_now(sd_event *event, clockid_t clock, uint64_t *usec);

DESCRIPTION
       sd_event_now() returns the time when the most recent event loop
       iteration began. A timestamp is taken right after returning from the
       event sleep, and before dispatching any event sources. The event
       parameter specifies the event loop object to retrieve the timestamp
       from. The clock parameter specifies the clock to retrieve the timestamp
       for, and is one of CLOCK_REALTIME (or equivalently
       CLOCK_REALTIME_ALARM), CLOCK_MONOTONIC, or CLOCK_BOOTTIME (or
       equivalently CLOCK_BOOTTIME_ALARM), see clock_gettime(2) for more
       information on the various clocks. The retrieved timestamp is stored in
       the usec parameter, in Âµs since the clock's epoch. If this function is
       invoked before the first event loop iteration, the current time is
       returned, as reported by clock_gettime(). To distinguish this case from
       a regular invocation the return value will be positive, and zero when
       the returned timestamp refers to an actual event loop iteration.

RETURN VALUE
       If the first event loop iteration has not run yet sd_event_now() writes
       current time to usec and returns a positive return value. Otherwise, it
       will write the requested timestamp to usec and return 0. On failure,
       the call returns a negative errno-style error code.

   Errors
       Returned values may indicate the following problems:

       -EINVAL
           An invalid parameter was passed.

       -EOPNOTSUPP
           Unsupported clock type.

       -ECHILD
           The event loop object was created in a different process.

NOTES
       These APIs are implemented as a shared library, which can be compiled
       and linked to with the libsystemd pkg-config(1) file.
