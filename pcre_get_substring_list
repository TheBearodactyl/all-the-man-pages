NAME
       PCRE - Perl-compatible regular expressions

SYNOPSIS

       #include <pcre.h>

       int pcre_get_substring_list(const char *subject,
            int *ovector, int stringcount, const char ***listptr);

       int pcre16_get_substring_list(PCRE_SPTR16 subject,
            int *ovector, int stringcount, PCRE_SPTR16 **listptr);

       int pcre32_get_substring_list(PCRE_SPTR32 subject,
            int *ovector, int stringcount, PCRE_SPTR32 **listptr);

DESCRIPTION

       This  is  a  convenience function for extracting a list of all the cap‚Äê
       tured substrings. The arguments are:

         subject       Subject that has been successfully matched
         ovector       Offset vector that pcre[16|32]_exec used
         stringcount   Value returned by pcre[16|32]_exec
         listptr       Where to put a pointer to the list

       The memory in which the substrings and the list are placed is  obtained
       by    calling    pcre[16|32]_malloc().    The    convenience   function
       pcre[16|32]_free_substring_list() can be used to free it when it is  no
       longer  needed.  A pointer to a list of pointers is put in the variable
       whose address is in listptr. The list is terminated by a NULL  pointer.
       The  yield of the function is zero on success or PCRE_ERROR_NOMEMORY if
       sufficient memory could not be obtained.

       There is a complete description of the PCRE native API in  the  pcreapi
       page and a description of the POSIX API in the pcreposix page.
