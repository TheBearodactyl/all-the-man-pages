ExtUtils::Typemaps::Cmd(3perl)                                                       Perl Programmers Reference Guide                                                       ExtUtils::Typemaps::Cmd(3perl)

NAME
       ExtUtils::Typemaps::Cmd - Quick commands for handling typemaps

SYNOPSIS
       From XS:

         INCLUDE_COMMAND: $^X -MExtUtils::Typemaps::Cmd \
                          -e "print embeddable_typemap(q{Excommunicated})"

       Loads "ExtUtils::Typemaps::Excommunicated", instantiates an object, and dumps it as an embeddable typemap for use directly in your XS file.

DESCRIPTION
       This is a helper module for ExtUtils::Typemaps for quick one-liners, specifically for inclusion of shared typemaps that live on CPAN into an XS file (see SYNOPSIS).

       For this reason, the following functions are exported by default:

EXPORTED FUNCTIONS
   embeddable_typemap
       Given a list of identifiers, "embeddable_typemap" tries to load typemaps from a file of the given name(s), or from a module that is an "ExtUtils::Typemaps" subclass.

       Returns a string representation of the merged typemaps that can be included verbatim into XS. Example:

         print embeddable_typemap(
           "Excommunicated", "ExtUtils::Typemaps::Basic", "./typemap"
         );

       This will try to load a module "ExtUtils::Typemaps::Excommunicated" and use it as an "ExtUtils::Typemaps" subclass. If that fails, it'll try loading "Excommunicated" as a module, if that fails,
       it'll try to read a file called Excommunicated. It'll work similarly for the second argument, but the third will be loaded as a file first.

       After loading all typemap files or modules, it will merge them in the specified order and dump the result as an embeddable typemap.
