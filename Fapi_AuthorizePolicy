NAME
       Fapi_AuthorizePolicy - Fapi_AuthorizePolicy

SYNOPSIS
   Functions
       TSS2_RC Fapi_AuthorizePolicy (FAPI_CONTEXT *context, char const *policyPath, char const *keyPath, uint8_t const *policyRef, size_t policyRefSize)
       TSS2_RC Fapi_AuthorizePolicy_Async (FAPI_CONTEXT *context, char const *policyPath, char const *keyPath, uint8_t const *policyRef, size_t policyRefSize)
       TSS2_RC Fapi_AuthorizePolicy_Finish (FAPI_CONTEXT *context)

Detailed Description
       FAPI functions to invoke AuthorizePolicy either as one-call or in an asynchronous manner.

Function Documentation
   Fapi_AuthorizePolicy (FAPI_CONTEXT * context, char const * policyPath, char const * keyPath, uint8_t const * policyRef, size_t policyRefSize)
       One-Call function for Fapi_AuthorizePolicy

       If a current policy happens to be a PolicyAuthorize, then for it to be used, the user must first satisfy a policy authorized by a having been signed (and made into a ticket) by an authorized
       party.

       Parameters
           context The FAPI context
           policyPath The path to the policy file
           keyPath The path to the signing key
           policyRef A byte buffer that is included in the signature. May be NULL
           policyRefSize The size of policyRef. Must be 0 if policyRef is NULL

       Return values
           TSS2_RC_SUCCESS if the function call was a success.
           TSS2_FAPI_RC_BAD_REFERENCE if context, policyPath or keyPath is NULL.
           TSS2_FAPI_RC_BAD_CONTEXT if context corruption is detected.
           TSS2_FAPI_RC_BAD_PATH if policyPath or keyPath does not map to a FAPI policy or key object.
           TSS2_FAPI_RC_BAD_SEQUENCE if the context has an asynchronous operation already pending.
           TSS2_FAPI_RC_IO_ERROR if the data cannot be saved.
           TSS2_FAPI_RC_MEMORY if the FAPI cannot allocate enough memory for internal operations or return parameters.
           TSS2_FAPI_RC_NO_TPM if FAPI was initialized in no-TPM-mode via its config file.
           TSS2_FAPI_RC_BAD_VALUE if an invalid value was passed into the function.
           TSS2_FAPI_RC_TRY_AGAIN if an I/O operation is not finished yet and this function needs to be called again.
           TSS2_FAPI_RC_GENERAL_FAILURE if an internal error occurred.
           TSS2_FAPI_RC_PATH_NOT_FOUND if a FAPI object path was not found during authorization.
           TSS2_FAPI_RC_KEY_NOT_FOUND if a key was not found.
           TSS2_FAPI_RC_AUTHORIZATION_UNKNOWN if a required authorization callback is not set.
           TSS2_FAPI_RC_AUTHORIZATION_FAILED if the authorization attempt fails.
           TSS2_FAPI_RC_POLICY_UNKNOWN if policy search for a certain policy digest was not successful.
           TSS2_ESYS_RC_* possible error codes of ESAPI.
           TSS2_FAPI_RC_NOT_PROVISIONED FAPI was not provisioned.

   Fapi_AuthorizePolicy_Async (FAPI_CONTEXT * context, char const * policyPath, char const * keyPath, uint8_t const * policyRef, size_t policyRefSize)
       Asynchronous function for Fapi_AuthorizePolicy

       If a current policy happens to be a PolicyAuthorize, then for it to be used, the user must first satisfy a policy authorized by a having been signed (and made into a ticket) by an authorized
       party.

       Call Fapi_AuthorizePolicy_Finish to finish the execution of this command.

       Parameters
           context The FAPI context
           policyPath The path to the policy file
           keyPath The path to the signing key
           policyRef A byte buffer that is included in the signature. May be NULL
           policyRefSize The size of policyRef. Must be 0 if policyRef is NULL

       Return values
           TSS2_RC_SUCCESS if the function call was a success.
           TSS2_FAPI_RC_BAD_REFERENCE if context, policyPath or keyPath is NULL.
           TSS2_FAPI_RC_BAD_CONTEXT if context corruption is detected.
           TSS2_FAPI_RC_BAD_PATH if policyPath or keyPath does not map to a FAPI policy or key object.
           TSS2_FAPI_RC_BAD_SEQUENCE if the context has an asynchronous operation already pending.
           TSS2_FAPI_RC_IO_ERROR if the data cannot be saved.
           TSS2_FAPI_RC_MEMORY if the FAPI cannot allocate enough memory for internal operations or return parameters.
           TSS2_FAPI_RC_BAD_VALUE if an invalid value was passed into the function.
           TSS2_FAPI_RC_NO_TPM if FAPI was initialized in no-TPM-mode via its config file.

   Fapi_AuthorizePolicy_Finish (FAPI_CONTEXT * context)
       Asynchronous finish function for Fapi_AuthorizePolicy

       This function should be called after a previous Fapi_AuthorizePolicy_Async.

       Parameters
           context The FAPI_CONTEXT

       Return values
           TSS2_RC_SUCCESS if the function call was a success.
           TSS2_FAPI_RC_BAD_REFERENCE if context is NULL.
           TSS2_FAPI_RC_BAD_CONTEXT if context corruption is detected.
           TSS2_FAPI_RC_BAD_SEQUENCE if the context has an asynchronous operation already pending.
           TSS2_FAPI_RC_IO_ERROR if the data cannot be saved.
           TSS2_FAPI_RC_MEMORY if the FAPI cannot allocate enough memory for internal operations or return parameters.
           TSS2_FAPI_RC_TRY_AGAIN if the asynchronous operation is not yet complete. Call this function again later.
           TSS2_FAPI_RC_GENERAL_FAILURE if an internal error occurred.
           TSS2_FAPI_RC_PATH_NOT_FOUND if a FAPI object path was not found during authorization.

           TSS2_FAPI_RC_BAD_VALUE if an invalid value was passed into the function.
           TSS2_FAPI_RC_AUTHORIZATION_UNKNOWN if a required authorization callback is not set.
           TSS2_FAPI_RC_AUTHORIZATION_FAILED if the authorization attempt fails.
           TSS2_FAPI_RC_POLICY_UNKNOWN if policy search for a certain policy digest was not successful.
           TSS2_ESYS_RC_* possible error codes of ESAPI.
           TSS2_FAPI_RC_NOT_PROVISIONED FAPI was not provisioned.
