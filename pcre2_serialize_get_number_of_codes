NAME
       PCRE2 - Perl-compatible regular expressions (revised API)

SYNOPSIS

       #include <pcre2.h>

       int32_t pcre2_serialize_get_number_of_codes(const uint8_t *bytes);

DESCRIPTION

       The  bytes  argument  must  point  to a serialized byte stream that was
       originally created by pcre2_serialize_encode() (though it may have been
       saved  on  disc or elsewhere in the meantime). The function returns the
       number of serialized patterns in the byte stream, or one of the follow‐
       ing negative error codes:

         PCRE2_ERROR_BADMAGIC  mismatch of id bytes in bytes
         PCRE2_ERROR_BADMODE   mismatch of variable unit size or PCRE version
         PCRE2_ERROR_NULL      the argument is NULL

       PCRE2_ERROR_BADMAGIC  may mean that the data is corrupt, or that it was
       compiled on a system with different endianness.

       There is a complete description of the PCRE2 native API in the pcre2api
       page and a description of the serialization functions in the pcre2seri‐
       alize page.
