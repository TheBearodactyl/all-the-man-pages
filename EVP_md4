NAME
       EVP_md4 - MD4 For EVP

SYNOPSIS
        #include <openssl/evp.h>

        const EVP_MD *EVP_md4(void);

DESCRIPTION
       MD4 is a cryptographic hash function standardized in RFC 1320 and designed by Ronald Rivest, first published in 1990. This implementation is only available with the legacy provider.

       EVP_md4()
           The MD4 algorithm which produces a 128-bit output from a given input.

RETURN VALUES
       These functions return a EVP_MD structure that contains the implementation of the message digest. See EVP_MD_meth_new(3) for details of the EVP_MD structure.

CONFORMING TO
       IETF RFC 1320.
