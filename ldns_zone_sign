NAME
       ldns_zone_sign, ldns_zone_sign_nsec3 - dnssec sign a zone

SYNOPSIS
       #include <stdint.h>
       #include <stdbool.h>

       #include <ldns/ldns.h>

       ldns_zone* ldns_zone_sign(const ldns_zone *zone, ldns_key_list *key_list);

       ldns_zone* ldns_zone_sign_nsec3(ldns_zone *zone, ldns_key_list *key_list, uint8_t algorithm, uint8_t flags, uint16_t iterations, uint8_t salt_length, uint8_t *salt);

DESCRIPTION
       ldns_zone_sign() Signs the zone, and returns a newly allocated signed zone
              zone: the zone to sign
              key_list: list of keys to sign with
              Returns signed zone

       ldns_zone_sign_nsec3() Signs the zone with NSEC3, and returns a newly allocated signed zone
              zone: the zone to sign
              key_list: list of keys to sign with
              algorithm: the NSEC3 hashing algorithm to use
              flags: NSEC3 flags
              iterations: the number of NSEC3 hash iterations to use
              salt_length: the length (in octets) of the NSEC3 salt
              salt: the NSEC3 salt data
              Returns signed zone
