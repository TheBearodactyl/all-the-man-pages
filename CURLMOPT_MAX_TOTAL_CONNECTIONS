NAME
       CURLMOPT_MAX_TOTAL_CONNECTIONS - max simultaneously open connections

SYNOPSIS
       #include <curl/curl.h>

       CURLMcode curl_multi_setopt(CURLM *handle, CURLMOPT_MAX_TOTAL_CONNECTIONS,
                                   long amount);

DESCRIPTION
       Pass  a  long  for the amount. The set number will be used as the maximum number of simultaneously open connections in total using this multi handle. For each new session, libcurl will open a new
       connection up to the limit set by CURLMOPT_MAX_TOTAL_CONNECTIONS(3). When the limit is reached, the sessions will be pending until there are available connections.  If  CURLMOPT_PIPELINING(3)  is
       enabled, libcurl will try to use multiplexing if the host is capable of it.

       When  more  transfers  are added to the multi handle than what can be performed due to the set limit, they will be queued up waiting for their chance. When that happens, the CURLOPT_TIMEOUT_MS(3)
       timeout will be counted inclusive of the waiting time, meaning that if you set a too narrow timeout in such a case the transfer might never even start before it times out.

       Even in the queued up situation, the CURLOPT_CONNECTTIMEOUT_MS(3) timeout is however treated as a per-connect timeout.

DEFAULT
       The default value is 0, which means that there is no limit. It is then simply controlled by the number of easy handles added.

PROTOCOLS
       All

EXAMPLE
       CURLM *m = curl_multi_init();
       /* never do more than 15 connections */
       curl_multi_setopt(m, CURLMOPT_MAX_TOTAL_CONNECTIONS, 15L);

AVAILABILITY
       Added in 7.30.0

RETURN VALUE
       Returns CURLM_OK if the option is supported, and CURLM_UNKNOWN_OPTION if not.
