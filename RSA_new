RSA_NEW(3ssl)                       OpenSSL                      RSA_NEW(3ssl)

NAME
       RSA_new, RSA_free - allocate and free RSA objects

SYNOPSIS
        #include <openssl/rsa.h>

       The following functions have been deprecated since OpenSSL 3.0, and can
       be hidden entirely by defining OPENSSL_API_COMPAT with a suitable
       version value, see openssl_user_macros(7):

        RSA *RSA_new(void);

        void RSA_free(RSA *rsa);

DESCRIPTION
       RSA_new() allocates and initializes an RSA structure. It is equivalent
       to calling RSA_new_method(NULL).

       RSA_free() frees the RSA structure and its components. The key is
       erased before the memory is returned to the system.  If rsa is NULL
       nothing is done.

RETURN VALUES
       If the allocation fails, RSA_new() returns NULL and sets an error code
       that can be obtained by ERR_get_error(3). Otherwise it returns a
       pointer to the newly allocated structure.

       RSA_free() returns no value.

SEE ALSO
       ERR_get_error(3), RSA_generate_key(3), RSA_new_method(3)

HISTORY
       All functions described here were deprecated in OpenSSL 3.0.  For
       replacement see EVP_PKEY-RSA(7).
