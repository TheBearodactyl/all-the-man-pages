NAME
       unw_set_cache_size -- set unwind cache size

SYNOPSIS
       #include <libunwind.h>

       int unw_set_cache_size(unw_addr_space_t as, size_t size, int flag);

DESCRIPTION
       The  unw_set_cache_size() routine sets the cache size of address space as to hold at least as many items as given by argument size.  It may hold more items as determined by the implementation. To
       disable caching, call unw_set_caching_policy) with a policy of UNW_CACHE_NONE.  Flag is currently unused and must be 0.

RETURN VALUE
       On successful completion, unw_set_cache_size() returns 0.  Otherwise the negative value of one of the error-codes below is returned.

THREAD AND SIGNAL SAFETY
       unw_set_cache_size() is thread-safe but not safe to use from a signal handler.

ERRORS
       UNW_ENOMEM
               The desired cache size could not be established because the application is out of memory.
