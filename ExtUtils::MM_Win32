NAME
       ExtUtils::MM_Win32 - methods to override UN*X behaviour in ExtUtils::MakeMaker

SYNOPSIS
        use ExtUtils::MM_Win32; # Done internally by ExtUtils::MakeMaker if needed

DESCRIPTION
       See ExtUtils::MM_Unix for a documentation of the methods provided there. This package overrides the implementation of these methods, not the semantics.

   Overridden methods
       dlsyms
       xs_dlsyms_ext
           On Win32, is ".def".

       replace_manpage_separator
           Changes the path separator with .

       maybe_command
           Since Windows has nothing as simple as an executable bit, we check the file extension.

           The PATHEXT env variable will be used to get a list of extensions that might indicate a command, otherwise .com, .exe, .bat and .cmd will be used by default.

       init_DIRFILESEP
           Using \ for Windows, except for "gmake" where it is /.

       init_tools
           Override some of the slower, portable commands with Windows specific ones.

       init_others
           Override the default link and compile tools.

           LDLOADLIBS's default is changed to $Config{libs}.

           Adjustments are made for Borland's quirks needing -L to come first.

       init_platform
           Add MM_Win32_VERSION.

       platform_constants
       specify_shell
           Set SHELL to $ENV{COMSPEC} only if make is type 'gmake'.

       constants
           Add MAXLINELENGTH for dmake before all the constants are output.

       special_targets
           Add .USESHELL target for dmake.

       static_lib_pure_cmd
           Defines how to run the archive utility

       dynamic_lib
           Methods are overridden here: not dynamic_lib itself, but the utility ones that do the OS-specific work.

       extra_clean_files
           Clean out some extra dll.{base,exp} files which might be generated by gcc.  Otherwise, take out all *.pdb files.

       init_linker
       perl_script
           Checks for the perl program under several common perl extensions.

       quote_dep
       xs_obj_opt
           Override to fixup -o flags for MSVC.

       pasthru
           All we send is -nologo to nmake to prevent it from printing its damned banner.

       arch_check (override)
           Normalize all arguments for consistency of comparison.

       oneliner
           These are based on what command.com does on Win98.  They may be wrong for other Windows shells, I don't know.

       cd  dmake can handle Unix style cd'ing but nmake (at least 1.5) cannot.  It wants:

               cd dir1\dir2
               command
               another_command
               cd ..\..

       max_exec_len
           nmake 1.50 limits command length to 2048 characters.

       os_flavor
           Windows is Win32.

       dbgoutflag
           Returns a CC flag that tells the CC to emit a separate debugging symbol file when compiling an object file.

       cflags
           Defines the PERLDLL symbol if we are configured for static building since all code destined for the perl5xx.dll must be compiled with the PERLDLL symbol defined.

       make_type
           Returns a suitable string describing the type of makefile being written.

perl v5.36.0                                                                                    2022-12-12                                                                       ExtUtils::MM_Win32(3perl)
