TERMKEY_PUSH_BYTES(3)                                                                    Library Functions Manual                                                                    TERMKEY_PUSH_BYTES(3)

NAME
       termkey_push_bytes - supply more bytes to the input buffer

SYNOPSIS
       #include <termkey.h>

       size_t termkey_push_bytes(TermKey *tk, const char *bytes, size_t len);

       Link with -ltermkey.

DESCRIPTION
       termkey_push_bytes() allows more bytes of input to be supplied directly into the input buffer of the termkey(7) instance. If there was no buffer space remaining then -1 is returned with errno set
       to ENOMEM.

       This function, along with termkey_getkey(3), makes it possible to use the termkey instance with a source of bytes other than from reading a filehandle.

       For synchronous usage, termkey_waitkey(3) performs the input blocking task. For use against a regular stream filehandle that supports read(2), see termkey_advisereadable(3).

RETURN VALUE
       termkey_push_bytes() the number of bytes consumed from the input (which may be smaller than the length provided, if the buffer runs out of space) or -1 cast to size_t if an error occurs, in which
       case errno is set accordingly.
