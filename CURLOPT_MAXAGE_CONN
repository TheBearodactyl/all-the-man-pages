NAME
       CURLOPT_MAXAGE_CONN - max idle time allowed for reusing a connection

SYNOPSIS
       #include <curl/curl.h>

       CURLcode curl_easy_setopt(CURL *handle, CURLOPT_MAXAGE_CONN, long age);

DESCRIPTION
       Pass a long as parameter containing age - the maximum time in seconds that you allow an existing connection to have been idle to be considered for reuse for this request.

       The  "connection cache" that holds previously used connections. When a new request is to be done, it will consider any connection that matches for reuse. The CURLOPT_MAXAGE_CONN(3) limit prevents
       libcurl from trying too old connections for reuse, since old connections have a high risk of not working and thus trying them is a performance loss and sometimes service loss due to the difficul‚Äê
       ties to figure out the situation. If a connection is found in the cache that is older than this set age, it will instead be closed.

DEFAULT
       Default maximum age is set to 118 seconds.

PROTOCOLS
       All

EXAMPLE
       CURL *curl = curl_easy_init();
       if(curl) {
         curl_easy_setopt(curl, CURLOPT_URL, "https://example.com");

         /* only allow 30 seconds idle time */
         curl_easy_setopt(curl, CURLOPT_MAXAGE_CONN, 30L);

         curl_easy_perform(curl);
       }

AVAILABILITY
       Added in 7.65.0

RETURN VALUE
       Returns CURLE_OK.
