NAME
       gnutls_x509_crt_get_extension_by_oid2 - API function

SYNOPSIS
       #include <gnutls/x509.h>

       int gnutls_x509_crt_get_extension_by_oid2(gnutls_x509_crt_t cert, const char * oid, unsigned indx, gnutls_datum_t * output, unsigned int * critical);

ARGUMENTS
       gnutls_x509_crt_t cert
                   should contain a gnutls_x509_crt_t type

       const char * oid
                   holds an Object Identified in null terminated string

       unsigned indx
                   In case multiple same OIDs exist in the extensions, this specifies which to send. Use (0) to get the first one.

       gnutls_datum_t * output
                   will hold the allocated extension data

       unsigned int * critical
                   will be non-zero if the extension is marked as critical

DESCRIPTION
       This function will return the extension specified by the OID in the certificate.  The extensions will be returned as binary data DER encoded, in the provided buffer.

RETURNS
       On  success,  GNUTLS_E_SUCCESS (0) is returned, otherwise a negative error code is returned. If the certificate does not contain the specified extension GNUTLS_E_REQUESTED_DATA_NOT_AVAILABLE will
       be returned.

SINCE
       3.3.8
