NAME
       PCRE - Perl-compatible regular expressions

SYNOPSIS

       #include <pcre.h>

       int pcre16_utf16_to_host_byte_order(PCRE_UCHAR16 *output,
            PCRE_SPTR16 input, int length, int *host_byte_order,
            int keep_boms);

DESCRIPTION

       This  function,  which  exists  only  in the 16-bit library, converts a
       UTF-16 string to the correct order for the current host, taking account
       of any byte order marks (BOMs) within the string. Its arguments are:

         output           pointer to output buffer, may be the same as input
         input            pointer to input buffer
         length           number of 16-bit units in the input, or negative for
                            a zero-terminated string
         host_byte_order  a NULL value or a non-zero value pointed to means
                            start in host byte order
         keep_boms        if non-zero, BOMs are copied to the output string

       The  result  of  the function is the number of 16-bit units placed into
       the output buffer, including the zero  terminator  if  the  string  was
       zero-terminated.

       If  host_byte_order  is  not NULL, it is set to indicate the byte order
       that is current at the end of the string.

       There is a complete description of the PCRE native API in  the  pcreapi
       page and a description of the POSIX API in the pcreposix page.
