PTHREAD_BARRIERATTR_DESTROYPOSIX Programmer's MPTHREAD_BARRIERATTR_DESTROY(3P)

PROLOG
       This  manual  page is part of the POSIX Programmer's Manual.  The Linux
       implementation of this interface may differ (consult the  corresponding
       Linux  manual page for details of Linux behavior), or the interface may
       not be implemented on Linux.

NAME
       pthread_barrierattr_destroy,  pthread_barrierattr_init  —  destroy  and
       initialize the barrier attributes object

SYNOPSIS
       #include <pthread.h>

       int pthread_barrierattr_destroy(pthread_barrierattr_t *attr);
       int pthread_barrierattr_init(pthread_barrierattr_t *attr);

DESCRIPTION
       The  pthread_barrierattr_destroy() function shall destroy a barrier at‐
       tributes object. A destroyed attr attributes object can  be  reinitial‐
       ized  using pthread_barrierattr_init(); the results of otherwise refer‐
       encing the object after it has been destroyed are undefined. An  imple‐
       mentation  may  cause  pthread_barrierattr_destroy()  to set the object
       referenced by attr to an invalid value.

       The pthread_barrierattr_init() function shall initialize a barrier  at‐
       tributes  object  attr with the default value for all of the attributes
       defined by the implementation.

       If pthread_barrierattr_init() is called specifying an already  initial‐
       ized attr attributes object, the results are undefined.

       After  a  barrier  attributes object has been used to initialize one or
       more barriers, any function affecting the attributes object  (including
       destruction) shall not affect any previously initialized barrier.

       The  behavior  is undefined if the value specified by the attr argument
       to pthread_barrierattr_destroy() does not refer to an initialized  bar‐
       rier attributes object.

RETURN VALUE
       If  successful,  the pthread_barrierattr_destroy() and pthread_barrier‐
       attr_init() functions shall return zero;  otherwise,  an  error  number
       shall be returned to indicate the error.

ERRORS
       The pthread_barrierattr_init() function shall fail if:

       ENOMEM Insufficient  memory exists to initialize the barrier attributes
              object.

       These functions shall not return an error code of [EINTR].

       The following sections are informative.

EXAMPLES
       None.

APPLICATION USAGE
       None.

RATIONALE
       If an implementation detects that the value specified by the attr argu‐
       ment  to pthread_barrierattr_destroy() does not refer to an initialized
       barrier attributes object, it is recommended that the  function  should
       fail and report an [EINVAL] error.

FUTURE DIRECTIONS
       None.
