NAME
       gnutls_record_discard_queued - API function

SYNOPSIS
       #include <gnutls/gnutls.h>

       size_t gnutls_record_discard_queued(gnutls_session_t session);

ARGUMENTS
       gnutls_session_t session
                   is a gnutls_session_t type.

DESCRIPTION
       This function discards all queued to be sent packets in a DTLS session.  These are the packets queued after an interrupted gnutls_record_send().

       This function can only be used with transports where send() is an all-or-nothing operation (e.g., UDP). When partial writes are allowed this function will cause session errors.

RETURNS
       The number of bytes discarded.

SINCE
       3.4.0
