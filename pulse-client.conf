NAME
       pulse-client.conf - PulseAudio client configuration file

SYNOPSIS
       ~/.config/pulse/client.conf

       ~/.config/pulse/client.conf.d/*.conf

       /etc/pulse/client.conf

       /etc/pulse/client.conf.d/*.conf

DESCRIPTION
       The  PulseAudio  client  library  reads configuration directives from a
       configuration  file  on  startup.  If   the   per-user   file   ~/.con‐
       fig/pulse/client.conf exists, it is used, otherwise the system configu‐
       ration file /etc/pulse/client.conf is used. In addition to  those  main
       files, configuration directives can also be put in files under directo‐
       ries  ~/.config/pulse/client.conf.d/   and   /etc/pulse/client.conf.d/.
       Those  files  have to have the .conf file name extension, but otherwise
       the file names can be chosen freely. The files under client.conf.d  are
       processed in alphabetical order. In case the same option is set in mul‐
       tiple files, the last file to set an option  overrides  earlier  files.
       The  main  client.conf file is processed first, so options set in files
       under client.conf.d override the main file.

       The configuration file is a simple collection of variable declarations.
       If  the  configuration  file parser encounters either ; or # it ignores
       the rest of the line until its end.

       For the settings that take a boolean argument the values true, yes,  on
       and 1 are equivalent, resp. false, no, off, 0.

DIRECTIVES
       default-sink=  The  default sink to connect to. If specified overwrites
       the setting in the daemon. The environment variable $PULSE_SINK however
       takes precedence.

       default-source=  The  default  source to connect to. If specified over‐
       writes  the  setting  in   the   daemon.   The   environment   variable
       $PULSE_SOURCE however takes precedence.

       default-server= The default server to connect to. The environment vari‐
       able $PULSE_SERVER takes precedence.

       autospawn= Autospawn a PulseAudio daemon when needed. Takes  a  boolean
       value,  defaults to yes. Note that setting this to "no" doesn't disable
       the systemd service. The autospawn option is only meant to be  used  on
       systems  without  systemd.  If you use systemd to start PulseAudio, use
       "systemctl --user stop pulseaudio.service  pulseaudio.socket"  to  stop
       the  daemon  temporarily,  or "systemctl --user mask pulseaudio.service
       pulseaudio.socket" to permanently disable the units (the "disable" com‐
       mand  of  systemctl  probably won't work, because the pulseaudio.socket
       unit is often installed to /usr/lib/systemd/user/sockets.target.wants/,
       which  makes  it impossible to disable the unit with the "disable" com‐
       mand).

       daemon-binary= Path to the PulseAudio daemon to run when  autospawning.
       Defaults to a path configured at compile time.

       extra-arguments=  Extra arguments to pass to the PulseAudio daemon when
       autospawning. Defaults to --log-target=syslog

       cookie-file= Specify the path to the PulseAudio authentication  cookie.
       Defaults to ~/.config/pulse/cookie.

       enable-shm=  Enable  data  transfer  via  POSIX or memfd shared memory.
       Takes a boolean argument, defaults to yes. If set to no,  communication
       with  the  server will be exclusively done through data-copy over sock‐
       ets.

       enable-memfd=. Enable data transfer via memfd shared  memory.  Takes  a
       boolean argument, defaults to yes.

       shm-size-bytes=  Sets  the  shared  memory segment size for clients, in
       bytes. If left unspecified or is set to 0 it will default to some  sys‐
       tem-specific default, usually 64 MiB. Please note that usually there is
       no need to change this value, unless you are running an OS kernel  that
       does not do memory overcommit.

       auto-connect-localhost=  Automatically  try to connect to localhost via
       IP. Enabling this is a potential security hole  since  connections  are
       only authenticated one-way and a rogue server might hence fool a client
       into sending it its private (e.g. VoIP call) data. This was enabled  by
       default on PulseAudio version 0.9.21 and older. Defaults to no.

       auto-connect-display=  Automatically  try  to connect to the host X11's
       $DISPLAY variable is set to. The same security issues apply as to auto-
       connect-localhost=. Defaults to no.
