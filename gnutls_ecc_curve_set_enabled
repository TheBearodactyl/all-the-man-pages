NAME
       gnutls_ecc_curve_set_enabled - API function

SYNOPSIS
       #include <gnutls/gnutls.h>

       int gnutls_ecc_curve_set_enabled(gnutls_ecc_curve_t curve, unsigned int enabled);

ARGUMENTS
       gnutls_ecc_curve_t curve
                   is an ECC curve

       unsigned int enabled
                   whether to enable the curve

DESCRIPTION
       Modify  the  previous  system wide setting that marked  curve as enabled or disabled.  Calling this function is allowed only if allowlisting mode is set in the configuration file, and only if the
       system-wide TLS priority string has not been initialized yet.  The intended usage is to provide applications with a way to expressly deviate from the distribution or site defaults inherited  from
       the configuration file.  The modification is composable with further modifications performed through the priority string mechanism.

       This function is not thread-safe and is intended to be called in the main thread at the beginning of the process execution.

RETURNS
       0 on success or negative error code otherwise.

SINCE
       3.7.3
