NAME
       gnutls_x509_crt_privkey_sign - API function

SYNOPSIS
       #include <gnutls/abstract.h>

       int gnutls_x509_crt_privkey_sign(gnutls_x509_crt_t crt, gnutls_x509_crt_t issuer, gnutls_privkey_t issuer_key, gnutls_digest_algorithm_t dig, unsigned int flags);

ARGUMENTS
       gnutls_x509_crt_t crt
                   a certificate of type gnutls_x509_crt_t

       gnutls_x509_crt_t issuer
                   is the certificate of the certificate issuer

       gnutls_privkey_t issuer_key
                   holds the issuer's private key

       gnutls_digest_algorithm_t dig
                   The message digest to use, GNUTLS_DIG_SHA256 is a safe choice

       unsigned int flags
                   must be 0

DESCRIPTION
       This function will sign the certificate with the issuer's private key, and will copy the issuer's information into the certificate.

       This must be the last step in a certificate generation since all the previously set parameters are now signed.

       A known limitation of this function is, that a newly-signed certificate will not be fully functional (e.g., for signature verification), until it is exported an re-imported.

       After GnuTLS 3.6.1 the value of  dig may be GNUTLS_DIG_UNKNOWN, and in that case, a suitable but reasonable for the key algorithm will be selected.

RETURNS
       On success, GNUTLS_E_SUCCESS (0) is returned, otherwise a negative error value.
