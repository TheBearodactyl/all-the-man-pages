NAME
       XkbSetIgnoreLockMods - Sets the modifiers that, if locked, are not to be reported in matching events to passive grabs

SYNOPSIS
       Bool XkbSetIgnoreLockMods (Display *display, unsigned int device_spec, unsigned int affect_real, unsigned int real_values, unsigned int affect_virtual, unsigned int virtual_values);

ARGUMENTS
       display
              connection to the X server

       device_spec
              device ID, or XkbUseCoreKbd

       affect_real
              mask of real modifiers affected by this call

       real_values
              values for affected real modifiers (1=>set, 0=>unset)

       affect_virtual
              mask of virtual modifiers affected by this call

       virtual_values
              values for affected virtual modifiers (1=>set, 0=>unset)

DESCRIPTION
       The core protocol does not provide a way to exclude specific modifiers from grab calculations, with the result that locking modifiers sometimes have unanticipated side effects.

       The  IgnoreLockMods control specifies modifiers that should be excluded from grab calculations. These modifiers are also not reported in any core events except KeyPress and KeyRelease events that
       do not activate a passive grab and that do not occur while a grab is active.

       Manipulate the IgnoreLockMods control via the ignore_lock field in the XkbControlsRec structure, then use XkbSetControls and XkbGetControls to query and change this  control.  Alternatively,  use
       XkbSetIgnoreLockMods.

       XkbSetIgnoreLockMods  sends a request to the server to change the server's IgnoreLockMods control.  affect_real and real_values are masks of real modifier bits indicating which real modifiers are
       to be added and removed from the server's IgnoreLockMods control. Modifiers selected by both affect_real and real_values are added to the server's IgnoreLockMods control; those  selected  by  af‐
       fect_real  but  not  by  real_values are removed from the server's IgnoreLockMods control. Valid values for affect_real and real_values consist of any combination of the eight core modifier bits:
       ShiftMask, LockMask, ControlMask, Mod1Mask - Mod5Mask.  affect_virtual and virtual_values are masks of virtual modifier bits indicating which virtual modifiers are to be added  and  removed  from
       the  server's  IgnoreLockMods  control.  Modifiers selected by both affect_virtual and virtual_values are added to the server's IgnoreLockMods control; those selected by affect_virtual but not by
       virtual_values are removed from the server's IgnoreLockMods control. See below for a discussion of virtual modifier masks to use in affect_virtual and  virtual_values.  XkbSetIgnoreLockMods  does
       not wait for a reply from the server. It returns True if the request was sent, and False otherwise.

       Virtual  modifiers  are named by converting their string name to an X Atom and storing the Atom in the names.vmods array in an XkbDescRec structure. The position of a name Atom in the names.vmods
       array defines the bit position used to represent the virtual modifier and also the index used when accessing virtual modifier information in arrays: the name in the i-th  (0  relative)  entry  of
       names.vmods  is  the  i-th virtual modifier, represented by the mask (1<<i). Throughout Xkb, various functions have a parameter that is a mask representing virtual modifier choices. In each case,
       the i-th bit (0 relative) of the mask represents the i-th virtual modifier.

       To set the name of a virtual modifier, use XkbSetNames, using XkbVirtualModNamesMask in which and the name in the xkb argument; to retrieve indicator names, use XkbGetNames.

STRUCTURES
       The complete description of an Xkb keyboard is given by an XkbDescRec. The component structures in the XkbDescRec represent the major Xkb components.

       typedef struct {
           struct _XDisplay * display;      /* connection to X server */
           unsigned short     flags;        /* private to Xkb, do not modify */
           unsigned short     device_spec;  /* device of interest */
           KeyCode            min_key_code; /* minimum keycode for device */
           KeyCode            max_key_code; /* maximum keycode for device */
           XkbControlsPtr     ctrls;        /* controls */
           XkbServerMapPtr    server;       /* server keymap */
           XkbClientMapPtr    map;          /* client keymap */
           XkbIndicatorPtr    indicators;   /* indicator map */
           XkbNamesPtr        names;        /* names for all components */
           XkbCompatMapPtr    compat;       /* compatibility map */
           XkbGeometryPtr     geom;         /* physical geometry of keyboard */
       } XkbDescRec, *XkbDescPtr;

       The display field points to an X display structure. The flags field is private to the library: modifying flags may yield unpredictable results. The device_spec field specifies the device  identi‐
       fier of the keyboard input device, or XkbUseCoreKeyboard, which specifies the core keyboard device. The min_key_code and max_key_code fields specify the least and greatest keycode that can be re‐
       turned by the keyboard.

       Each structure component has a corresponding mask bit that is used in function calls to indicate that the structure should be manipulated in some manner, such as  allocating  it  or  freeing  it.
       These masks and their relationships to the fields in the XkbDescRec are shown in Table 1.
