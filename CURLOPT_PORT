NAME
       CURLOPT_PORT - remote port number to connect to

SYNOPSIS
       #include <curl/curl.h>

       CURLcode curl_easy_setopt(CURL *handle, CURLOPT_PORT, long number);

DESCRIPTION
       We discourage using this option since its scope is not obvious and hard to predict. Set the preferred port number in the URL instead.

       This option sets number to be the remote port number to connect to, instead of the one specified in the URL or the default port for the used protocol.

       Usually, you just let the URL decide which port to use but this allows the application to override that.

       While this option accepts a 'long', a port number is an unsigned 16 bit number and therefore using a port number lower than zero or over 65535 will cause a CURLE_BAD_FUNCTION_ARGUMENT error.

DEFAULT
       By default this is 0 which makes it not used. This also makes port number zero impossible to set with this API.

PROTOCOLS
       Used for all protocols that speak to a port number.

EXAMPLE
       CURL *curl = curl_easy_init();
       if(curl) {
         curl_easy_setopt(curl, CURLOPT_URL, "https://example.com/foo.bin");
         curl_easy_setopt(curl, CURLOPT_PORT, 8080L);
         ret = curl_easy_perform(curl);
         curl_easy_cleanup(curl);
       }

AVAILABILITY
       Always

RETURN VALUE
       Returns CURLE_OK
