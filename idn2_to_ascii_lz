NAME
       idn2_to_ascii_lz - API function

SYNOPSIS
       #include <idn2.h>

       int idn2_to_ascii_lz(const char * input, char ** output, int flags);

ARGUMENTS
       const char * input
                   zero terminated input UTF-8 string.

       char ** output
                   pointer to newly allocated output string.

       int flags   optional idn2_flags to modify behaviour.

DESCRIPTION
       Convert  a domain name in locale's encoding to ASCII string using the IDNA2008 rules.  The domain name may contain several labels, separated by dots.  The output buffer must be deallocated by the
       caller.

       The default behavior of this function (when flags are zero) is to apply the IDNA2008 rules without the TR46 amendments. As the TR46 non-transitional processing is nowadays  ubiquitous,  when  un‐
       sure, it is recommended to call this function with the IDN2_NONTRANSITIONAL and the IDN2_NFC_INPUT flags for compatibility with other software.

RETURNS
       IDN2_OK on success, or error code.  Same as described in idn2_lookup_ul() documentation.

SINCE
       2.0.0
