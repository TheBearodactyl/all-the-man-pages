NAME
       unw_getcontext -- get initial machine-state

SYNOPSIS
       #include <libunwind.h>

       int unw_getcontext(unw_context_t *ucp);

DESCRIPTION
       The  unw_getcontext()  routine  initializes the context structure pointed to by ucp with the machine-state of the call-site. The exact set of registers stored by unw_getcontext() is platform-spe‐
       cific, but, in general, at least all preserved (``callee-saved'') and all frame-related registers, such as the stack-pointer, will be stored.

       This routine is normally implemented as a macro and applications should not attempt to take its address.

PLATFORM-SPECIFIC NOTES
       On IA-64, unw_context_t has a layout that is compatible with that of ucontext_t and such structures can be initialized with getcontext() instead of unw_getcontext().  However, the reverse is  not
       true  and  it  is not safe to use structures initialized by unw_getcontext() in places where a structure initialized by getcontext() is expected. The reason for this asymmetry is that unw_getcon‐
       text() is optimized for maximum performance and does not, for example, save the signal mask.

RETURN VALUE
       On successful completion, unw_getcontext() returns 0.  Otherwise, a value of -1 is returned.

THREAD AND SIGNAL SAFETY
       unw_getcontext() is thread-safe as well as safe to use from a signal handler.
