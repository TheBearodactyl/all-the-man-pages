PROLOG
       This  manual  page is part of the POSIX Programmer's Manual.  The Linux
       implementation of this interface may differ (consult the  corresponding
       Linux  manual page for details of Linux behavior), or the interface may
       not be implemented on Linux.

NAME
       shift — shift positional parameters

SYNOPSIS
       shift [n]

DESCRIPTION
       The positional parameters shall  be  shifted.  Positional  parameter  1
       shall  be  assigned  the value of parameter (1+n), parameter 2 shall be
       assigned the value of parameter (2+n), and so on. The parameters repre‐
       sented by the numbers "$#" down to "$#-n+1" shall be unset, and the pa‐
       rameter '#' is updated to reflect the new number of positional  parame‐
       ters.

       The  value n shall be an unsigned decimal integer less than or equal to
       the value of the special parameter '#'.  If n is not given, it shall be
       assumed  to  be 1. If n is 0, the positional and special parameters are
       not changed.

       shell does not exit in this case, a non-zero exit status shall  be  re‐
       turned. Otherwise, zero shall be returned.
