NAME
       gnutls_error_is_fatal - API function

SYNOPSIS
       #include <gnutls/gnutls.h>

       int gnutls_error_is_fatal(int error);

ARGUMENTS
       int error   is a GnuTLS error code, a negative error code

DESCRIPTION
       If a GnuTLS function returns a negative error code you may feed that value to this function to see if the error condition is fatal to a TLS session (i.e., must be terminated).

       Note that you may also want to check the error code manually, since some non-fatal errors to the protocol (such as a warning alert or a rehandshake request) may be fatal for your program.

       This function is only useful if you are dealing with errors from functions that relate to a TLS session (e.g., record layer or handshake layer handling functions).

RETURNS
       Non-zero value on fatal errors or zero on non-fatal.
