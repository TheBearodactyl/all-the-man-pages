NAME
       asn1_der_decoding2 - API function

SYNOPSIS
       #include <libtasn1.h>

       int asn1_der_decoding2(asn1_node * element, const void * ider, int * max_ider_len, unsigned int flags, char * errorDescription);

ARGUMENTS
       asn1_node * element
                   pointer to an ASN1 structure.

       const void * ider
                   vector that contains the DER encoding.

       int * max_ider_len
                   pointer to an integer giving the information about the maximal number of bytes occupied by * ider . The real size of the DER encoding is returned through this pointer.

       unsigned int flags
                   flags controlling the behaviour of the function.

       char * errorDescription
                   null-terminated string contains details when an error occurred.

DESCRIPTION
       Fill the structure * element with values of a DER encoding string. The structure must just be created with function asn1_create_element().

       If  ASN1_DECODE_FLAG_ALLOW_PADDING  flag is set then the function will ignore padding after the decoded DER data. Upon a successful return the value of * max_ider_len will be set to the number of
       bytes decoded.

       If ASN1_DECODE_FLAG_STRICT_DER flag is set then the function will not decode any BER-encoded elements.

RETURNS
       ASN1_SUCCESS if DER encoding OK, ASN1_ELEMENT_NOT_FOUND if  ELEMENT is NULL, and ASN1_TAG_ERROR or ASN1_DER_ERROR if the der encoding doesn't match the structure name (* ELEMENT deleted).
