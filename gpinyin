DESCRIPTION
       gpinyin is a preprocessor for groff(1) that facilitates use of the Hanyu Pinyin groff(7) files.  Pinyin is a method for writing the Chinese language with the Latin alphabet.  The Chinese language
       consists of more than four hundred syllables, each with one of five different tones.  In Pinyin, a syllable is written in the Latin alphabet and a numeric tone indicator can be appended  to  each
       syllable.

       Each  input-file  is a file name or the hyphen-minus character “-” to indicate that standard input should be read.  As usual, the argument “--” can be used in order to force interpretation of all
       remaining arguments as file names, even if an input-file argument begins with the hyphen-minus character.

   Pinyin Sections
       Pinyin sections in groff files are enclosed by two .pinyin requests with different arguments.  The starting request is
              .pinyin start
       or
              .pinyin begin
       and the ending request is
              .pinyin stop
       or
              .pinyin end
       .

   Syllables
       The spoken Chinese language is based on about 411 syllables; see ⟨http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pinyin_table⟩.

       In Pinyin, each syllable consists of one to six letters from the Latin alphabet; these letters comprise the fifty-two upper- and lowercase letters from the ASCII character set,  plus  the  letter
       “U” with dieresis (umlaut) in both cases—in other words, the members of the set “[a–zA–ZüÜ]”.

       In  groff input, all ASCII letters are written as themselves.  The “u with dieresis” can be written as “\[:u]” in lowercase or “\[:U]” in uppercase.  Within .pinyin sections, gpinyin supports the
       form “ue” for lowercase and the forms “Ue” and “UE” for uppercase.

   Tones
       Each syllable has exactly one of five tones.  The fifth tone is not explicitly written at all, but each of the first through fourth tones is indicated with a  diacritic  above  a  specific  vowel
       within the syllable.

       In  a  gpinyin  source  file, these tones are written by adding a numeral in the range 0 to 5 after the syllable.  The tone numbers 1 to 4 are transformed into accents above vowels in the output.
       The tone numbers 0 and 5 are synonymous.

       The following table summarizes the tones.  Some output devices will not be able to render every output example.

       Tone     Description      Diacritic   Example Input   Example Output
       ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
       first    flat             ¯           ma1             mā
       second   rising           ´           ma2             má
       third    falling-rising   ˇ           ma3             mǎ
       fourth   falling          `           ma4             mà
       fifth    neutral          (none)      ma0             ma
                                             ma5

       The neutral tone number can be omitted from a word-final syllable, but not otherwise.
