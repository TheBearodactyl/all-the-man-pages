NAME
       asn1_expand_any_defined_by - API function

SYNOPSIS
       #include <libtasn1.h>

       int asn1_expand_any_defined_by(asn1_node_const definitions, asn1_node * element);

ARGUMENTS
       asn1_node_const definitions
                   ASN1 definitions

       asn1_node * element
                   pointer to an ASN1 structure

DESCRIPTION
       Expands  every  "ANY DEFINED BY" element of a structure created from a DER decoding process (asn1_der_decoding function). The element ANY must be defined by an OBJECT IDENTIFIER. The type used to
       expand the element ANY is the first one following the definition of the actual value of the OBJECT IDENTIFIER.

RETURNS
       ASN1_SUCCESS if Substitution OK, ASN1_ERROR_TYPE_ANY if some "ANY DEFINED BY" element couldn't be expanded due to a problem in OBJECT_ID -> TYPE association, or other error codes depending on DER
       decoding.
