NAME
       ares_cancel - Cancel a resolve

SYNOPSIS
       #include <ares.h>

       void ares_cancel(ares_channel channel)

DESCRIPTION
       The  ares_cancel(3)  function cancels all lookups/requests made on the the name service channel identified by channel.  ares_cancel(3) invokes the callbacks for each pending query on the channel,
       passing a status of ARES_ECANCELLED.  These calls give the callbacks a chance to clean up any state which might have been stored in their arguments. If such a callback invocation adds a  new  re‚Äê
       quest to the channel, that request will not be cancelled by the current invocation of ares_cancel(3).

SEE ALSO
       ares_init(3) ares_destroy(3)

NOTES
       This function was added in c-ares 1.2.0

       c-ares 1.6.0 and earlier pass a status of ARES_ETIMEOUT instead of ARES_ECANCELLED.
