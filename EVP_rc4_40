NAME
       EVP_rc4, EVP_rc4_40, EVP_rc4_hmac_md5 - EVP RC4 stream cipher

SYNOPSIS
        #include <openssl/evp.h>

        const EVP_CIPHER *EVP_rc4(void);
        const EVP_CIPHER *EVP_rc4_40(void);
        const EVP_CIPHER *EVP_rc4_hmac_md5(void);

DESCRIPTION
       The RC4 stream cipher for EVP.

       EVP_rc4()
           RC4 stream cipher. This is a variable key length cipher with a default key length of 128 bits.

       EVP_rc4_40()
           RC4 stream cipher with 40 bit key length.

           WARNING: this function is obsolete. Its usage should be replaced with the EVP_rc4() and the EVP_CIPHER_CTX_set_key_length() functions.

       EVP_rc4_hmac_md5()
           Authenticated encryption with the RC4 stream cipher with MD5 as HMAC.

           WARNING: this is not intended for usage outside of TLS and requires calling of some undocumented ctrl functions. These ciphers do not conform to the EVP AEAD interface.

RETURN VALUES
       These functions return an EVP_CIPHER structure that contains the implementation of the symmetric cipher. See EVP_CIPHER_meth_new(3) for details of the EVP_CIPHER structure.
