NAME
       CURLOPT_MAX_SEND_SPEED_LARGE - rate limit data upload speed

SYNOPSIS
       #include <curl/curl.h>

       CURLcode curl_easy_setopt(CURL *handle, CURLOPT_MAX_SEND_SPEED_LARGE,
                                 curl_off_t maxspeed);

DESCRIPTION
       Pass  a  curl_off_t  as  parameter  with the maxspeed.  If an upload exceeds this speed (counted in bytes per second) the transfer will pause to keep the speed less than or equal to the parameter
       value.  Defaults to unlimited speed.

       This is not an exact science. libcurl attempts to keep the average speed below the given threshold over a period time.

       If you set maxspeed to a value lower than CURLOPT_UPLOAD_BUFFERSIZE(3), libcurl might "shoot over" the limit on its first send and still send off a full buffer.

       This option does not affect transfer speeds done with FILE:// URLs.

DEFAULT
       0, disabled

PROTOCOLS
       All except file://

EXAMPLE
       CURL *curl = curl_easy_init();
       if(curl) {
         CURLcode ret;
         curl_easy_setopt(curl, CURLOPT_URL, "https://example.com/");
         /* cap the upload speed to 1000 bytes/sec */
         curl_easy_setopt(curl, CURLOPT_MAX_SEND_SPEED_LARGE, (curl_off_t)1000);
         /* (set some upload options as well!) */
         ret = curl_easy_perform(curl);
       }

AVAILABILITY
       Added in 7.15.5

RETURN VALUE
       Returns CURLE_OK if the option is supported, and CURLE_UNKNOWN_OPTION if not.
