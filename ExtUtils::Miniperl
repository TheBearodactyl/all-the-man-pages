NAME
       ExtUtils::Miniperl - write the C code for miniperlmain.c and perlmain.c

SYNOPSIS
           use ExtUtils::Miniperl;
           writemain(@directories);
           # or
           writemain($fh, @directories);
           # or
           writemain(\$filename, @directories);

DESCRIPTION
       "writemain()" takes an argument list of zero or more directories containing archive libraries that relate to perl modules and should be linked into a new perl binary. It writes a corresponding
       miniperlmain.c or perlmain.c file that is a plain C file containing all the bootstrap code to make the modules associated with the libraries available from within perl.  If the first argument to
       "writemain()" is a reference to a scalar it is used as the filename to open for output. Any other reference is used as the filehandle to write to. Otherwise output defaults to "STDOUT".

       The typical usage is from within perl's own Makefile (to build perlmain.c) or from regen/miniperlmain.pl (to build miniperlmain.c).  So under normal circumstances you won't have to deal with this
       module directly.
