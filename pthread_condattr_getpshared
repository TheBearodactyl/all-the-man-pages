PTHREAD_CONDATTR_GETPSHAREDPOSIX Programmer's MPTHREAD_CONDATTR_GETPSHARED(3P)

PROLOG
       This  manual  page is part of the POSIX Programmer's Manual.  The Linux
       implementation of this interface may differ (consult the  corresponding
       Linux  manual page for details of Linux behavior), or the interface may
       not be implemented on Linux.

NAME
       pthread_condattr_getpshared, pthread_condattr_setpshared — get and  set
       the process-shared condition variable attributes

SYNOPSIS
       #include <pthread.h>

       int pthread_condattr_getpshared(const pthread_condattr_t *restrict attr,
           int *restrict pshared);
       int pthread_condattr_setpshared(pthread_condattr_t *attr,
           int pshared);

DESCRIPTION
       The  pthread_condattr_getpshared()  function  shall obtain the value of
       the process-shared attribute from the attributes object  referenced  by
       attr.

       The pthread_condattr_setpshared() function shall set the process-shared
       attribute in an initialized attributes object referenced by attr.

       The process-shared attribute is set to PTHREAD_PROCESS_SHARED to permit
       a  condition variable to be operated upon by any thread that has access
       to the memory where the condition variable is allocated,  even  if  the
       condition  variable  is  allocated in memory that is shared by multiple
       processes. See Section 2.9.9, Synchronization Object Copies and  Alter‐
       native  Mappings for further requirements. The default value of the at‐
       tribute is PTHREAD_PROCESS_PRIVATE.

       The behavior is undefined if the value specified by the  attr  argument
       to  pthread_condattr_getpshared() or pthread_condattr_setpshared() does
       not refer to an initialized condition variable attributes object.

RETURN VALUE
       If successful, the pthread_condattr_setpshared() function shall  return
       zero;  otherwise, an error number shall be returned to indicate the er‐
       ror.

       If successful, the pthread_condattr_getpshared() function shall  return
       zero  and  store the value of the process-shared attribute of attr into
       the object referenced by the pshared  parameter.  Otherwise,  an  error
       number shall be returned to indicate the error.

ERRORS
       The pthread_condattr_setpshared() function may fail if:

       EINVAL The  new  value specified for the attribute is outside the range
              of legal values for that attribute.

       These functions shall not return an error code of [EINTR].

       The following sections are informative.

EXAMPLES
       None.

APPLICATION USAGE
       None.

RATIONALE
       If an implementation detects that the value specified by the attr argu‐
       ment  to pthread_condattr_getpshared() or pthread_condattr_setpshared()
       does not refer to an initialized condition variable attributes  object,
       it  is recommended that the function should fail and report an [EINVAL]
       error.

FUTURE DIRECTIONS
       None.
