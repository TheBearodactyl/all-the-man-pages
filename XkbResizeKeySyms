NAME
       XkbResizeKeySyms - Change the number of symbols bound to a key

SYNOPSIS
       KeySym * XkbResizeKeySyms (XkbDescRec *xkb, int key, int needed);

ARGUMENTS
       xkb    keyboard description to be changed

       key    keycode for key to modify

       needed new number of keysyms required for key

DESCRIPTION
       XkbResizeKeySyms  reserves the space needed for needed keysyms and returns a pointer to the beginning of the new array that holds the keysyms. It adjusts the offset field of the key_sym_map entry
       for the key if necessary and can also change the syms, num_syms, and size_syms fields of xkb->map if it is necessary to reallocate the syms array.  XkbResizeKeySyms does  not  modify  either  the
       width or number of groups associated with the key.

       If needed is greater than the current number of keysyms for the key, XkbResizeKeySyms initializes all new keysyms in the array to NoSymbol.

       Because  the  number of symbols needed by a key is normally computed as width * number of groups, and XkbResizeKeySyms does not modify either the width or number of groups for the key, a discrep‐
       ancy exists upon return from XkbResizeKeySyms between the space allocated for the keysyms and the number required. The unused entries in the list of symbols returned by XkbResizeKeySyms  are  not
       preserved  across future calls to any of the map editing functions, so you must update the key symbol mapping (which updates the width and number of groups for the key) before calling another al‐
       locator function. A call to XkbChangeTypesOfKey will update the mapping.

       If any allocation errors occur while resizing the number of symbols bound to the key, XkbResizeKeySyms returns NULL.

NOTES
       A change to the number of symbols bound to a key should be accompanied by a change in the number of actions bound to a key. Refer to XkbResizeKeyActions for more information on changing the  num‐
       ber of actions bound to a key.
