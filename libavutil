NAME
       libavutil - multimedia-biased utility library

DESCRIPTION
       The libavutil library is a utility library to aid portable multimedia programming. It contains safe portable string functions, random number generators, data structures, additional mathematics
       functions, cryptography and multimedia related functionality (like enumerations for pixel and sample formats). It is not a library for code needed by both libavcodec and libavformat.

       The goals for this library is to be:

       Modular
           It should have few interdependencies and the possibility of disabling individual parts during ./configure.

       Small
           Both sources and objects should be small.

       Efficient
           It should have low CPU and memory usage.

       Useful
           It should avoid useless features that almost no one needs.
