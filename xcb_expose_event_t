NAME
       xcb_expose_event_t - NOT YET DOCUMENTED

SYNOPSIS
       #include <xcb/xproto.h>

   Event datastructure
       typedef struct xcb_expose_event_t {
           uint8_t      response_type;
           uint8_t      pad0;
           uint16_t     sequence;
           xcb_window_t window;
           uint16_t     x;
           uint16_t     y;
           uint16_t     width;
           uint16_t     height;
           uint16_t     count;
           uint8_t      pad1[2];
       } xcb_expose_event_t;

EVENT FIELDS
       response_type
                 The type of this event, in this case XCB_EXPOSE. This field is also present in the xcb_generic_event_t and can be used to tell events apart from each other.

       sequence  The sequence number of the last request processed by the X11 server.

       window    The exposed (damaged) window.

       x         The X coordinate of the left-upper corner of the exposed rectangle, relative to the window's origin.

       y         The Y coordinate of the left-upper corner of the exposed rectangle, relative to the window's origin.

       width     The width of the exposed rectangle.

       height    The height of the exposed rectangle.

       count     The amount of Expose events following this one. Simple applications that do not want to optimize redisplay by distinguishing between subareas of its window can just ignore all Expose
                 events with nonzero counts and perform full redisplays on events with zero counts.
