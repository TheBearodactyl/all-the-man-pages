NAME
       gnutls_x509_crq_get_basic_constraints - API function

SYNOPSIS
       #include <gnutls/x509.h>

       int gnutls_x509_crq_get_basic_constraints(gnutls_x509_crq_t crq, unsigned int * critical, unsigned int * ca, int * pathlen);

ARGUMENTS
       gnutls_x509_crq_t crq
                   should contain a gnutls_x509_crq_t type

       unsigned int * critical
                   will be non-zero if the extension is marked as critical

       unsigned int * ca
                   pointer to output integer indicating CA status, may be NULL, value is 1 if the certificate CA flag is set, 0 otherwise.

       int * pathlen
                   pointer to output integer indicating path length (may be NULL), non-negative error codes indicate a present pathLenConstraint field and the actual value, -1 indicate that the field is
                   absent.

DESCRIPTION
       This function will read the certificate's basic constraints, and return the certificates CA status.  It reads the basicConstraints X.509 extension (2.5.29.19).

RETURNS
       If the certificate is a CA a positive value will be returned, or (0) if the certificate does not have CA flag set.  A negative error code may be returned in case of errors.   If  the  certificate
       does not contain the basicConstraints extension GNUTLS_E_REQUESTED_DATA_NOT_AVAILABLE will be returned.

SINCE
       2.8.0
