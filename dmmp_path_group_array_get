NAME
       dmmp_path_group_array_get - Retrieve path groups pointer array.

SYNOPSIS
       void dmmp_path_group_array_get (struct dmmp_mpath *dmmp_mp, struct dmmp_path_group ***dmmp_pgs, uint32_t *dmmp_pg_count);

ARGUMENTS
       dmmp_mp     Pointer of 'struct dmmp_mpath'.  If this pointer is NULL, your program will be terminated by assert.

       dmmp_pgs    Output pointer of 'struct dmmp_path_group' pointer array.  If this pointer is NULL, your program will be terminated by assert.

       dmmp_pg_count
                   Output pointer of uint32_t. Hold the size of 'dmmp_pgs' pointer array.  If this pointer is NULL, your program will be terminated by assert.

DESCRIPTION
       Retrieve the path groups of certain mpath.

       The memory of output pointer array is hold by 'struct dmmp_mpath', no need to free this memory, the resources will got freed when dmmp_mpath_array_free.

RETURN
       void
