NAME
       TIFFReadFromUserBuffer - decode data using an user defined buffer

SYNOPSIS
          #include <tiffio.h>

       int TIFFReadFromUserBuffer(TIFF *tif, uint32_t strile, void *inbuf, tmsize_t insize, void *outbuf, tmsize_t outsize)

DESCRIPTION
       Use  the provided input buffer (inbuf, insize) and decompress it into (outbuf, outsize). This function replaces the use of TIFFReadEncodedStrip() / TIFFReadEncodedTile() when the user can provide
       the buffer for the input data, for example when he wants to avoid libtiff to read the strile offset/count values from the StripOffsets / StripByteCounts or TileOffsets  /  TileByteCounts  arrays.
       inbuf content must be writable (if bit reversal is needed).

RETURN VALUES
       Returns 1 in case of success, 0 otherwise.

DIAGNOSTICS
       All error messages are directed to the TIFFErrorExtR() routine.
