NAME
       gnutls_pcert_export_x509 - API function

SYNOPSIS
       #include <gnutls/abstract.h>

       int gnutls_pcert_export_x509(gnutls_pcert_st * pcert, gnutls_x509_crt_t * crt);

ARGUMENTS
       gnutls_pcert_st * pcert
                   The pcert structure.

       gnutls_x509_crt_t * crt
                   An initialized gnutls_x509_crt_t.

DESCRIPTION
       Converts the given gnutls_pcert_t type into a gnutls_x509_crt_t.  This function only works if the type of  pcert is GNUTLS_CRT_X509.  When successful, the value written to  crt must be freed with
       gnutls_x509_crt_deinit() when no longer needed.

RETURNS
       On success, GNUTLS_E_SUCCESS (0) is returned, otherwise a negative error value.

SINCE
       3.4.0
