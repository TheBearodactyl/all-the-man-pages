DESCRIPTION
       The  getpwnam()  function  returns a pointer to a structure containing the broken-out fields of the record in the password database (e.g., the local password file /etc/passwd, NIS, and LDAP) that
       matches the username name.

       The getpwuid() function returns a pointer to a structure containing the broken-out fields of the record in the password database that matches the user ID uid.

       The passwd structure is defined in <pwd.h> as follows:

           struct passwd {
               char   *pw_name;       /* username */
               char   *pw_passwd;     /* user password */
               uid_t   pw_uid;        /* user ID */
               gid_t   pw_gid;        /* group ID */
               char   *pw_gecos;      /* user information */
               char   *pw_dir;        /* home directory */
               char   *pw_shell;      /* shell program */
           };

       See passwd(5) for more information about these fields.

       The getpwnam_r() and getpwuid_r() functions obtain the same information as getpwnam() and getpwuid(), but store the retrieved passwd structure in the space pointed to by pwd.  The  string  fields
       pointed  to  by  the members of the passwd structure are stored in the buffer buf of size buflen.  A pointer to the result (in case of success) or NULL (in case no entry was found or an error oc‐
       curred) is stored in *result.

       The call

           sysconf(_SC_GETPW_R_SIZE_MAX)

       returns either -1, without changing errno, or an initial suggested size for buf.  (If this size is too small, the call fails with ERANGE, in which case the caller can retry with a larger buffer.)

RETURN VALUE
       The getpwnam() and getpwuid() functions return a pointer to a passwd structure, or NULL if the matching entry is not found or an error occurs.  If an error occurs, errno is set  to  indicate  the
       error.  If one wants to check errno after the call, it should be set to zero before the call.

       The return value may point to a static area, and may be overwritten by subsequent calls to getpwent(3), getpwnam(), or getpwuid().  (Do not pass the returned pointer to free(3).)

       On success, getpwnam_r() and getpwuid_r() return zero, and set *result to pwd.  If no matching password record was found, these functions return 0 and store NULL in *result.  In case of error, an
       error number is returned, and NULL is stored in *result.

ERRORS
       0 or ENOENT or ESRCH or EBADF or EPERM or ...
              The given name or uid was not found.

       EINTR  A signal was caught; see signal(7).

       EIO    I/O error.

       EMFILE The per-process limit on the number of open file descriptors has been reached.

       ENFILE The system-wide limit on the total number of open files has been reached.

       ENOMEM Insufficient memory to allocate passwd structure.

       ERANGE Insufficient buffer space supplied.

VERSIONS
       The pw_gecos field is not specified in POSIX, but is present on most implementations.

STANDARDS
       POSIX.1-2008.

HISTORY
       POSIX.1-2001, SVr4, 4.3BSD.

NOTES
       The formulation given above under "RETURN VALUE" is from POSIX.1-2001.  It does not call "not found" an error, and hence does not specify what value errno might have in this situation.  But  that
       makes it impossible to recognize errors.  One might argue that according to POSIX errno should be left unchanged if an entry is not found.  Experiments on various UNIX-like systems show that lots
       of different values occur in this situation: 0, ENOENT, EBADF, ESRCH, EWOULDBLOCK, EPERM, and probably others.

       The pw_dir field contains the name of the initial working directory of the user.  Login programs use the value of this field to initialize the HOME environment variable for the login  shell.   An
       application that wants to determine its user's home directory should inspect the value of HOME (rather than the value getpwuid(getuid())->pw_dir) since this allows the user to modify their notion
       of "the home directory" during a login session.  To determine the (initial) home directory of another user, it is necessary to use getpwnam("username")->pw_dir or similar.

       The program below demonstrates the use of getpwnam_r() to find the full username and user ID for the username supplied as a command-line argument.

NAME
       getpwuid, getpwuid_r — search user database for a user ID

SYNOPSIS
       #include <pwd.h>

       struct passwd *getpwuid(uid_t uid);
       int getpwuid_r(uid_t uid, struct passwd *pwd, char *buffer,
           size_t bufsize, struct passwd **result);

DESCRIPTION
       The getpwuid() function shall search the user database for an entry with a matching uid.

       The getpwuid() function need not be thread-safe.

       Applications wishing to check for error situations should set errno to 0 before calling getpwuid().  If getpwuid() returns a null pointer and errno is set to non-zero, an error occurred.

       The getpwuid_r() function shall update the passwd structure pointed to by pwd and store a pointer to that structure at the location pointed to by result.  The structure  shall  contain  an  entry
       from  the  user  database  with  a  matching  uid.   Storage referenced by the structure is allocated from the memory provided with the buffer parameter, which is bufsize bytes in size. A call to
       sysconf(_SC_GETPW_R_SIZE_MAX) returns either -1 without changing errno or an initial value suggested for the size of this buffer.  A null pointer shall be returned at the location pointed  to  by
       result on error or if the requested entry is not found.

RETURN VALUE
       The  getpwuid() function shall return a pointer to a struct passwd with the structure as defined in <pwd.h> with a matching entry if found. A null pointer shall be returned if the requested entry
       is not found, or an error occurs. If the requested entry was not found, errno shall not be changed. On error, errno shall be set to indicate the error.

       The application shall not modify the structure to which the return value points, nor any storage areas pointed to by pointers within the structure. The returned pointer, and pointers  within  the
       structure,  might  be  invalidated  or  the  structure or the storage areas might be overwritten by a subsequent call to getpwent(), getpwnam(), or getpwuid().  The returned pointer, and pointers
       within the structure, might also be invalidated if the calling thread is terminated.

       If successful, the getpwuid_r() function shall return zero; otherwise, an error number shall be returned to indicate the error.

ERRORS
       These functions may fail if:

       EIO    An I/O error has occurred.

       EINTR  A signal was caught during getpwuid().

       EMFILE All file descriptors available to the process are currently open.

       ENFILE The maximum allowable number of files is currently open in the system.

       The getpwuid_r() function may fail if:

       ERANGE Insufficient storage was supplied via buffer and bufsize to contain the data to be referenced by the resulting passwd structure.

       The following sections are informative.

EXAMPLES
       Note that sysconf(_SC_GETPW_R_SIZE_MAX) may return -1 if there is no hard limit on the size of the buffer needed to store all the groups returned. This example shows how an application can  allo‐
       cate a buffer of sufficient size to work with getpwuid_r().

           long int initlen = sysconf(_SC_GETPW_R_SIZE_MAX);
           size_t len;
           if (initlen == -1)
               /* Default initial length. */
               len = 1024;
           else
               len = (size_t) initlen;
           struct passwd result;
           struct passwd *resultp;
           char *buffer = malloc(len);
           if (buffer == NULL)
               ...handle error...
           int e;
           while ((e = getpwuid_r(42, &result, buffer, len, &resultp)) == ERANGE)
               {
               size_t newlen = 2 * len;
               if (newlen < len)
                   ...handle error...
               len = newlen;
               char *newbuffer = realloc(buffer, len);
               if (newbuffer == NULL)
                   ...handle error...
               buffer = newbuffer;
               }
           if (e != 0)
               ...handle error...
           free (buffer);

   Getting an Entry for the Root User
       The following example gets the user database entry for the user with user ID 0 (root).

           #include <sys/types.h>
           #include <pwd.h>
           ...
           uid_t id = 0;
           struct passwd *pwd;

           pwd = getpwuid(id);

   Finding the Name for the Effective User ID
       The  following example defines pws as a pointer to a structure of type passwd, which is used to store the structure pointer returned by the call to the getpwuid() function. The geteuid() function
       shall return the effective user ID of the calling process; this is used as the search criteria for the getpwuid() function. The call to getpwuid() shall return a pointer to the structure contain‐
       ing that user ID value.

           #include <unistd.h>
           #include <sys/types.h>
           #include <pwd.h>
           ...
           struct passwd *pws;
           pws = getpwuid(geteuid());

   Finding an Entry in the User Database
       The  following  example  uses getpwuid() to search the user database for a user ID that was previously stored in a stat structure, then prints out the user name if it is found. If the user is not
       found, the program prints the numeric value of the user ID for the entry.

           #include <sys/types.h>
           #include <pwd.h>
           #include <stdio.h>
           ...
           struct stat statbuf;
           struct passwd *pwd;
           ...
           if ((pwd = getpwuid(statbuf.st_uid)) != NULL)
               printf(" %-8.8s", pwd->pw_name);
           else
               printf(" %-8d", statbuf.st_uid);

APPLICATION USAGE
       Three names associated with the current process can be determined: getpwuid(geteuid()) returns the name associated with the effective user ID of the process; getlogin() returns the  name  associ‐
       ated with the current login activity; and getpwuid(getuid()) returns the name associated with the real user ID of the process.

       The getpwuid_r() function is thread-safe and returns values in a user-supplied buffer instead of possibly using a static data area that may be overwritten by each call.

       Portable applications should take into account that it is usual for an implementation to return -1 from sysconf() indicating that there is no maximum for _SC_GETPW_R_SIZE_MAX.

RATIONALE
       None.

FUTURE DIRECTIONS
       None.
