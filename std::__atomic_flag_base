std::__atomic_flag_base(3) Library Functions Manual std::__atomic_flag_base(3)

NAME
       std::__atomic_flag_base - Base type for atomic_flag.

SYNOPSIS
       #include <atomic>

       Inherited by std::atomic_flag.

   Public Attributes
       __atomic_flag_data_type _M_i

Detailed Description
       Base type for atomic_flag.

       Base type is POD with data, allowing atomic_flag to derive from it and
       meet the standard layout type requirement. In addition to compatibility
       with a C interface, this allows different implementations of
       atomic_flag to use the same atomic operation functions, via a standard
       conversion to the __atomic_flag_base argument.
