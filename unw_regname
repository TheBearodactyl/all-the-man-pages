NAME
       unw_regname -- get register name

SYNOPSIS
       #include <libunwind.h>

       const char *unw_regname(unw_regnum_t regnum);

DESCRIPTION
       The  unw_regname()  routine  returns  a  printable name for register regnum.  If regnum is an invalid or otherwise unrecognized register number, a string consisting of three question marks is re‚Äê
       turned. The returned string is statically allocated and therefore guaranteed to remain valid until the application terminates.

RETURN VALUE
       The unw_regname() routine cannot fail and always returns a valid (non-NULL) string.

THREAD AND SIGNAL SAFETY
       The unw_regname() routine is thread-safe as well as safe to use from a signal handler.
