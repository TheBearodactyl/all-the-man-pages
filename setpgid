PROLOG
       This  manual  page is part of the POSIX Programmer's Manual.  The Linux
       implementation of this interface may differ (consult the  corresponding
       Linux  manual page for details of Linux behavior), or the interface may
       not be implemented on Linux.

NAME
       setpgid — set process group ID for job control

SYNOPSIS
       #include <unistd.h>

       int setpgid(pid_t pid, pid_t pgid);

DESCRIPTION
       The setpgid() function shall either join an existing process  group  or
       create a new process group within the session of the calling process.

       The process group ID of a session leader shall not change.

       Upon  successful completion, the process group ID of the process with a
       process ID that matches pid shall be set to pgid.

       As a special case, if pid is 0, the process ID of the  calling  process
       shall  be  used.  Also,  if  pgid is 0, the process ID of the indicated
       process shall be used.

RETURN VALUE
       Upon successful completion, setpgid() shall  return  0;  otherwise,  -1
       shall be returned and errno shall be set to indicate the error.

ERRORS
       The setpgid() function shall fail if:

       EACCES The  value of the pid argument matches the process ID of a child
              process of the calling process and the child  process  has  suc‐
              cessfully executed one of the exec functions.

       EINVAL The value of the pgid argument is less than 0, or is not a value
              supported by the implementation.

       EPERM  The process indicated by the pid argument is a session leader.

       EPERM  The value of the pid argument matches the process ID of a  child
              process  of  the calling process and the child process is not in
              the same session as the calling process.

       EPERM  The value of the pgid argument is valid but does not  match  the
              process  ID  of  the  process  indicated by the pid argument and
              there is no process with a process group  ID  that  matches  the
              value  of  the  pgid argument in the same session as the calling
              process.

       ESRCH  The value of the pid argument does not match the process  ID  of
              the  calling  process  or  of  a  child  process  of the calling
              process.

       The following sections are informative.

EXAMPLES
       None.

APPLICATION USAGE
       None.

RATIONALE
       The setpgid() function shall group processes together for  the  purpose
       of signaling, placement in foreground or background, and other job con‐
       trol actions.

       The setpgid() function is similar to the setpgrp() function of 4.2 BSD,
       except  that  4.2 BSD allowed the specified new process group to assume
       any value. This presents certain security problems and is more flexible
       than necessary to support job control.

       To  provide tighter security, setpgid() only allows the calling process
       to join a process group already in use inside its session or  create  a
       new process group whose process group ID was equal to its process ID.

       When  a  job  control  shell spawns a new job, the processes in the job
       must be placed into a new process group via setpgid().  There  are  two
       timing constraints involved in this action:

        1. The  new process must be placed in the new process group before the
           appropriate program is launched via one of the exec functions.

        2. The new process must be placed in the new process group before  the
           shell can correctly send signals to the new process group.

       To  address these constraints, the following actions are performed. The
       new processes call setpgid() to alter their own  process  groups  after
       fork() but before exec.  This satisfies the first constraint. Under 4.3
       BSD, the second constraint is satisfied by the synchronization property
       of  vfork();  that  is, the shell is suspended until the child has com‐
       pleted the exec,  thus  ensuring  that  the  child  has  completed  the
       setpgid().   A  new  version  of  fork() with this same synchronization
       property was considered, but it was decided instead to merely allow the
       parent shell process to adjust the process group of its child processes
       via setpgid().  Both timing constraints are  now  satisfied  by  having
       both the parent shell and the child attempt to adjust the process group
       of the child process; it does not matter which succeeds first.

       Since it would be confusing to an application to have its process group
       change  after it began executing (that is, after exec), and because the
       child process would already have  adjusted  its  process  group  before
       this, the [EACCES] error was added to disallow this.

       One non-obvious use of setpgid() is to allow a job control shell to re‐
       turn itself to its original process group (the one in effect  when  the
       job  control  shell was executed). A job control shell does this before
       returning control back to its parent when it is terminating or suspend‐
       ing itself as a way of restoring its job control ``state'' back to what
       its parent would expect. (Note that the original process group  of  the
       job  control  shell  typically matches the process group of its parent,
       but this is not necessarily always the case.)

FUTURE DIRECTIONS
       None.

DESCRIPTION
       All  of  these interfaces are available on Linux, and are used for get‐
       ting and setting the process group ID (PGID) of a  process.   The  pre‐
       ferred,  POSIX.1-specified  ways  of doing this are: getpgrp(void), for
       retrieving the calling process's PGID; and  setpgid(),  for  setting  a
       process's PGID.

       setpgid()  sets  the  PGID of the process specified by pid to pgid.  If
       pid is zero, then the process ID of the calling process  is  used.   If
       pgid is zero, then the PGID of the process specified by pid is made the
       same as its process ID.  If setpgid() is used to move  a  process  from
       one  process  group to another (as is done by some shells when creating
       pipelines), both process groups must be part of the same  session  (see
       setsid(2) and credentials(7)).  In this case, the pgid specifies an ex‐
       isting process group to be joined and the session ID of that group must
       match the session ID of the joining process.

       The POSIX.1 version of getpgrp(), which takes no arguments, returns the
       PGID of the calling process.

       getpgid() returns the PGID of the process specified by pid.  If pid  is
       zero,  the  process ID of the calling process is used.  (Retrieving the
       PGID of a process other than the caller is rarely  necessary,  and  the
       POSIX.1 getpgrp() is preferred for that task.)

       The  System V-style  setpgrp(), which takes no arguments, is equivalent
       to setpgid(0, 0).

       The BSD-specific setpgrp() call, which takes arguments pid and pgid, is
       a wrapper function that calls

           setpgid(pid, pgid)

       Since  glibc 2.19, the BSD-specific setpgrp() function is no longer ex‐
       posed by <unistd.h>; calls should be replaced with the  setpgid()  call
       shown above.

       The  BSD-specific getpgrp() call, which takes a single pid argument, is
       a wrapper function that calls

           getpgid(pid)

       Since glibc 2.19, the BSD-specific getpgrp() function is no longer  ex‐
       posed by <unistd.h>; calls should be replaced with calls to the POSIX.1
       getpgrp() which takes no arguments (if the  intent  is  to  obtain  the
       caller's PGID), or with the getpgid() call shown above.

RETURN VALUE
       On  success,  setpgid() and setpgrp() return zero.  On error, -1 is re‐
       turned, and errno is set to indicate the error.

       The POSIX.1 getpgrp() always returns the PGID of the caller.

       getpgid(), and the BSD-specific getpgrp() return  a  process  group  on
       success.   On  error,  -1 is returned, and errno is set to indicate the
       error.

ERRORS
       EACCES An attempt was made to change the process group ID of one of the
              children  of  the calling process and the child had already per‐
              formed an execve(2) (setpgid(), setpgrp()).

       EINVAL pgid is less than 0 (setpgid(), setpgrp()).

       EPERM  An attempt was made to move a process into a process group in  a
              different  session,  or to change the process group ID of one of
              the children of the calling process and the child was in a  dif‐
              ferent  session,  or to change the process group ID of a session
              leader (setpgid(), setpgrp()).

       EPERM  The target process group  does  not  exist.   (setpgid(),  setp‐
              grp()).

       ESRCH  For  getpgid():  pid does not match any process.  For setpgid():
              pid is not the calling process and not a child  of  the  calling
              process.

NOTES
       A  child  created  via  fork(2) inherits its parent's process group ID.
       The PGID is preserved across an execve(2).

       Each process group is a member of a session and each process is a  mem‐
       ber  of  the session of which its process group is a member.  (See cre‐
       dentials(7).)

       A session can have a controlling terminal.  At any time, one (and  only
       one) of the process groups in the session can be the foreground process
       group for the terminal; the remaining process groups are in  the  back‐
       ground.   If  a signal is generated from the terminal (e.g., typing the
       interrupt key to generate SIGINT), that signal is  sent  to  the  fore‐
       ground process group.  (See termios(3) for a description of the charac‐
       ters that generate signals.)  Only the  foreground  process  group  may
       read(2)  from  the  terminal;  if  a  background process group tries to
       read(2) from the terminal, then the group is  sent  a  SIGTTIN  signal,
       which  suspends  it.   The  tcgetpgrp(3) and tcsetpgrp(3) functions are
       used to get/set the foreground process group of the controlling  termi‐
       nal.

       The  setpgid() and getpgrp() calls are used by programs such as bash(1)
       to create process groups in order to implement shell job control.

       If the termination of a process causes a process group  to  become  or‐
       phaned,  and  if  any  member  of  the  newly orphaned process group is
       stopped, then a SIGHUP signal followed by a SIGCONT signal will be sent
       to  each  process  in  the  newly  orphaned process group.  An orphaned
       process group is one in which the parent of  every  member  of  process
       group  is either itself also a member of the process group or is a mem‐
       ber of a process  group  in  a  different  session  (see  also  creden‐
       tials(7)).
