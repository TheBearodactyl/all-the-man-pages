NAME
       gnutls_certificate_get_ocsp_expiration - API function

SYNOPSIS
       #include <gnutls/gnutls.h>

       time_t gnutls_certificate_get_ocsp_expiration(gnutls_certificate_credentials_t sc, unsigned idx, int oidx, unsigned flags);

ARGUMENTS
       gnutls_certificate_credentials_t sc
                   is a credentials structure.

       unsigned idx
                   is a certificate chain index as returned by gnutls_certificate_set_key() and friends

       int oidx    is an OCSP response index

       unsigned flags
                   should be zero

DESCRIPTION
       This function returns the validity of the loaded OCSP responses, to provide information on when to reload/refresh them.

       Note  that  the  credentials  structure  should  be read-only when in use, thus when reloading, either the credentials structure must not be in use by any sessions, or a new credentials structure
       should be allocated for new sessions.

       When  oidx is (-1) then the minimum refresh time for all responses is returned. Otherwise the index specifies the response corresponding to the  odix certificate in the certificate chain.

RETURNS
       On success, the expiration time of the OCSP response. Otherwise (time_t)(-1) on error, or (time_t)-2 on out of bounds.

SINCE
       3.6.3
