NAME
       ldns_dname_cat_clone, ldns_dname_cat - concatenate two dnames

SYNOPSIS
       #include <stdint.h>
       #include <stdbool.h>

       #include <ldns/ldns.h>

       ldns_rdf* ldns_dname_cat_clone(const ldns_rdf *rd1, const ldns_rdf *rd2);

       ldns_status ldns_dname_cat(ldns_rdf *rd1, const ldns_rdf *rd2);

DESCRIPTION
       ldns_dname_cat_clone() concatenates two dnames together
              rd1: the leftside
              rd2: the rightside
              Returns a new rdf with leftside/rightside

       ldns_dname_cat() concatenates rd2 after rd1 (rd2 is copied, rd1 is modified)
              rd1: the leftside
