NAME
       XkbFreeGeomProperties - Free geometry properties

SYNOPSIS
       void XkbFreeGeomProperties (XkbGeometryPtr geom, int first, int count, Bool *free_all);

ARGUMENTS
       geom   geometry in which properties should be freed

       first  first property to be freed

       count  number of properties to be freed

       free_all
              True => all properties are freed

DESCRIPTION
       Xkb  provides a number of functions to allocate and free subcomponents of a keyboard geometry. Use these functions to create or modify keyboard geometries.  Note that these functions merely allo‚Äê
       cate space for the new element(s), and it is up to you to fill in the values explicitly in your code. These allocation functions increase sz_* but never touch num_* (unless there is an allocation
       failure,  in which case they reset both sz_* and num_* to zero). These functions return Success if they succeed, BadAlloc if they are not able to allocate space, or BadValue if a parameter is not
       as expected.

       If free_all is True, all properties are freed regardless of the value of first or count.  Otherwise, count properties are freed beginning with the one specified by first.

RETURN VALUES
       Success        The XkbFreeGeomProperties function returns Success when there are no allocation or argument errors.

DIAGNOSTICS
       BadAlloc       Unable to allocate storage

       BadValue       An argument is out of range
