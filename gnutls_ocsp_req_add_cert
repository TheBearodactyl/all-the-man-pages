NAME
       gnutls_ocsp_req_add_cert - API function

SYNOPSIS
       #include <gnutls/ocsp.h>

       int gnutls_ocsp_req_add_cert(gnutls_ocsp_req_t req, gnutls_digest_algorithm_t digest, gnutls_x509_crt_t issuer, gnutls_x509_crt_t cert);

ARGUMENTS
       gnutls_ocsp_req_t req
                   should contain a gnutls_ocsp_req_t type

       gnutls_digest_algorithm_t digest
                   hash algorithm, a gnutls_digest_algorithm_t value

       gnutls_x509_crt_t issuer
                   issuer of  subject certificate

       gnutls_x509_crt_t cert
                   certificate to request status for

DESCRIPTION
       This function will add another request to the OCSP request for a particular certificate.  The issuer name hash, issuer key hash, and serial number fields is populated as follows.  The issuer name
       and the serial number is taken from  cert .  The issuer key is taken from  issuer .  The hashed values will be hashed using the  digest algorithm, normally GNUTLS_DIG_SHA1.

RETURNS
       On success, GNUTLS_E_SUCCESS (0) is returned, otherwise a negative error code is returned.
