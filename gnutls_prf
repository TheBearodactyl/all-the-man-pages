NAME
       gnutls_prf - API function

SYNOPSIS
       #include <gnutls/gnutls.h>

       int gnutls_prf(gnutls_session_t session, size_t label_size, const char * label, int server_random_first, size_t extra_size, const char * extra, size_t outsize, char * out);

ARGUMENTS
       gnutls_session_t session
                   is a gnutls_session_t type.

       size_t label_size
                   length of the  label variable.

       const char * label
                   label used in PRF computation, typically a short string.

       int server_random_first
                   non-zero if server random field should be first in seed

       size_t extra_size
                   length of the  extra variable.

       const char * extra
                   optional extra data to seed the PRF with.

       size_t outsize
                   size of pre-allocated output buffer to hold the output.

       char * out  pre-allocated buffer to hold the generated data.

DESCRIPTION
       Applies  the  TLS  Pseudo-Random-Function  (PRF)  on  the  master  secret  and  the provided data, seeded with the client and server random fields.  For the key expansion specified in RFC5705 see
       gnutls_prf_rfc5705().

       The  label variable usually contains a string denoting the purpose for the generated data.  The  server_random_first indicates whether the client random field or the server random field should be
       first in the seed.  Non-zero indicates that the server random field is first, 0 that the client random field is first.

       The   extra variable can be used to add more data to the seed, after the random variables.  It can be used to make sure the generated output is strongly connected to some additional data (e.g., a
       string used in user authentication).

       The output is placed in  out , which must be pre-allocated.

NOTE
       This function produces identical output with gnutls_prf_rfc5705() when  server_random_first is set to 0 and  extra is NULL. Under TLS1.3 this function will only operate when these conditions  are
       true, or otherwise return GNUTLS_E_INVALID_REQUEST.

RETURNS
       GNUTLS_E_SUCCESS on success, or an error code.
