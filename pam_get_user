PAM_GET_USER(3)                Linux-PAM Manual                PAM_GET_USER(3)

NAME
       pam_get_user - get user name

SYNOPSIS
       #include <security/pam_modules.h>

       int pam_get_user(const pam_handle_t *pamh, const char **user,
                        const char *prompt);

DESCRIPTION
       The pam_get_user function returns the name of the user specified by
       pam_start(3). If no user was specified it returns what pam_get_item
       (pamh, PAM_USER, ... ); would have returned. If this is NULL it obtains
       the username via the pam_conv(3) mechanism, it prompts the user with
       the first non-NULL string in the following list:

       •   The prompt argument passed to the function.

       •   What is returned by pam_get_item (pamh, PAM_USER_PROMPT, ... );

       •   The default prompt: "login: "

       By whatever means the username is obtained, a pointer to it is returned
       as the contents of *user. Note, this memory should not be free()'d or
       modified by the module.

       This function sets the PAM_USER item associated with the
       pam_set_item(3) and pam_get_item(3) functions.

RETURN VALUES
       PAM_SUCCESS
           User name was successful retrieved.

       PAM_SYSTEM_ERR
           A NULL pointer was submitted.

       PAM_CONV_ERR
           The conversation method supplied by the application failed to
           obtain the username.

       PAM_BUF_ERR
           Memory buffer error.

       PAM_ABORT
           Error resuming an old conversation.

       PAM_CONV_AGAIN

           an event.
