NAME
       xcb_change_save_set - Changes a client's save set

SYNOPSIS
       #include <xcb/xproto.h>

   Request function
       xcb_void_cookie_t xcb_change_save_set(xcb_connection_t *conn, uint8_t mode, xcb_window_t window);

REQUEST ARGUMENTS
       conn      The XCB connection to X11.

       mode      One of the following values:

                 XCB_SET_MODE_INSERT
                           TODO: NOT YET DOCUMENTED.

                 XCB_SET_MODE_DELETE
                           TODO: NOT YET DOCUMENTED.

                 Insert to add the specified window to the save set or Delete to delete it from the save set.

       window    The window to add or delete to/from your save set.

DESCRIPTION
       TODO: explain what the save set is for.

       This function either adds or removes the specified window to the client's (your application's) save set.

RETURN VALUE
       Returns an xcb_void_cookie_t. Errors (if any) have to be handled in the event loop.

       If you want to handle errors directly with xcb_request_check instead, use xcb_change_save_set_checked. See xcb-requests(3) for details.

ERRORS
       xcb_match_error_t
                 You created the specified window. This does not make sense, you can only add windows created by other clients to your save set.

       xcb_value_error_t
                 You specified an invalid mode.

       xcb_window_error_t
                 The specified window does not exist.
