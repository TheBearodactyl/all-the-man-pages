NAME
       XtSetKeyboardFocus - focus events on a child widget

SYNTAX
       #include <X11/Intrinsic.h>

       void XtSetKeyboardFocus(Widget subtree, Widget descendant);

ARGUMENTS
       subtree   Specifies either the widget in the subtree structure which is to receive the keyboard event, or None.  Note that it is not an error to specify None when no input focus was previously
                 set.

       descendant
                 Specifies the widget for which the keyboard focus is to be set.

DESCRIPTION
       If a future KeyPress or KeyRelease event occurs within the specified subtree, XtSetKeyboardFocus causes XtDispatchEvent to remap and send the event to the specified descendant widget.

       When there is no modal cascade, keyboard events can occur within a widget W in one of three ways:

       •    W has the X input focus.

       •    W has the keyboard focus of one of its ancestors, and the event occurs within the ancestor or one of the ancestor's descendants.

       •    No ancestor of W has a descendant within the keyboard focus, and the pointer is within W.

       When there is a modal cascade, a widget W receives keyboard events if an ancestor of W is in the active subset of the modal cascade and one or more of the previous conditions is True.

       When subtree or one of its descendants acquires the X input focus or the pointer moves into the subtree such that keyboard events would now be delivered to subtree, a FocusIn event is generated
       for the descendant if FocusNotify events have been selected by the descendant.  Similarly, when W loses the X input focus or the keyboard focus for one of its ancestors, a FocusOut event is gen‐
       erated for descendant if FocusNotify events have been selected by the descendant.
