NAME
       Digest::file - Calculate digests of files

SYNOPSIS
         # Poor mans "md5sum" command
         use Digest::file qw(digest_file_hex);
         for (@ARGV) {
             print digest_file_hex($_, "MD5"), "  $_\n";
         }

DESCRIPTION
       This module provide 3 convenience functions to calculate the digest of files.  The following functions are provided:

       digest_file( $file, $algorithm, [$arg,...] )
           This function will calculate and return the binary digest of the bytes of the given file.  The function will croak if it fails to open or read the file.

           The $algorithm is a string like "MD2", "MD5", "SHA-1", "SHA-512".  Additional arguments are passed to the constructor for the implementation of the given algorithm.

       digest_file_hex( $file, $algorithm, [$arg,...] )
           Same as digest_file(), but return the digest in hex form.

       digest_file_base64( $file, $algorithm, [$arg,...] )
           Same as digest_file(), but return the digest as a base64 encoded string.
