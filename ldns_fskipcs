NAME
       ldns_fget_token, ldns_fskipcs - get tokens from files

SYNOPSIS
       #include <stdint.h>
       #include <stdbool.h>

       #include <ldns/ldns.h>

       ssize_t ldns_fget_token(FILE *f, char *token, const char *delim, size_t limit);

       void ldns_fskipcs(FILE *fp, const char *s);

DESCRIPTION
       ldns_fget_token() returns a token/char from the stream F.  This function deals with ( and ) in the stream, and ignores them when encountered
              *f: the file to read from
              *token: the read token is put here
              *delim: chars at which the parsing should stop
              *limit: how much to read. If 0 the builtin maximum is used
              Returns 0 on error of EOF of the stream F.  Otherwise return the length of what is read

       ldns_fskipcs() skips all of the characters in the given string in the fp, moving the position to the first character that is not in *s.
              *fp: file to use
              *s: characters to skip
              Returns void
