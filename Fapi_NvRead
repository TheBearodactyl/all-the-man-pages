SYNOPSIS
   Functions
       TSS2_RC Fapi_NvRead (FAPI_CONTEXT *context, char const *path, uint8_t **data, size_t *size, char **logData)

Detailed Description
       FAPI functions to invoke NvRead either as one-call or in an asynchronous manner.

Function Documentation
   TSS2_RC Fapi_NvRead (FAPI_CONTEXT * context, char const * nvPath, uint8_t ** data, size_t * size, char ** logData)
       One-Call function for Fapi_NvRead

       Reads data from an NV index within the TPM. The FAPI will automatically do the multiple reads if the NV index is larger than the TPM's TPM2_MAX_NV_BUFFER_SIZE.

       Parameters
           context The FAPI_CONTEXT
           nvPath The path of the NV index to read
           data The data that was read from the NV index
           size The size of data in bytes. May be NULL
           logData The log data of the NV index if the index is of type 'extend'. May be NULL

       Return values
           TSS2_RC_SUCCESS if the function call was a success.
           TSS2_FAPI_RC_BAD_REFERENCE if context, nvPath or data is NULL.
           TSS2_FAPI_RC_BAD_CONTEXT if context corruption is detected.
           TSS2_FAPI_RC_BAD_PATH if nvPath is not found.
           TSS2_FAPI_RC_AUTHORIZATION_FAILED if authorization fails.
           TSS2_FAPI_RC_AUTHORIZATION_UNKNOWN if don't know how to authenticate.
           TSS2_FAPI_RC_NV_NOT_READABLE if the NV is not a readable index.
           TSS2_FAPI_RC_BAD_SEQUENCE if the context has an asynchronous operation already pending.
           TSS2_FAPI_RC_IO_ERROR if the data cannot be saved.
           TSS2_FAPI_RC_MEMORY if the FAPI cannot allocate enough memory for internal operations or return parameters.
           TSS2_FAPI_RC_NO_TPM if FAPI was initialized in no-TPM-mode via its config file.
           TSS2_FAPI_RC_PATH_NOT_FOUND if a FAPI object path was not found during authorization.
           TSS2_FAPI_RC_KEY_NOT_FOUND if a key was not found.
           TSS2_FAPI_RC_BAD_VALUE if an invalid value was passed into the function.
           TSS2_FAPI_RC_TRY_AGAIN if an I/O operation is not finished yet and this function needs to be called again.
           TSS2_FAPI_RC_GENERAL_FAILURE if an internal error occurred.
           TSS2_FAPI_RC_POLICY_UNKNOWN if policy search for a certain policy digest was not successful.
           TSS2_ESYS_RC_* possible error codes of ESAPI.
           TSS2_FAPI_RC_NOT_PROVISIONED FAPI was not provisioned.

   TSS2_RC Fapi_NvRead_Async (FAPI_CONTEXT * context, char const * nvPath)
       Asynchronous function for Fapi_NvRead

       Reads data from an NV index within the TPM. The FAPI will automatically do the multiple reads if the NV index is larger than the TPM's TPM2_MAX_NV_BUFFER_SIZE.

       Call Fapi_NvRead_Finish to finish the execution of this command.

       Parameters
           context The FAPI_CONTEXT
           nvPath The path of the NV index to read

       Return values
           TSS2_RC_SUCCESS if the function call was a success.
           TSS2_FAPI_RC_BAD_REFERENCE if context or nvPath is NULL. *
           TSS2_FAPI_RC_BAD_CONTEXT if context corruption is detected.
           TSS2_FAPI_RC_BAD_PATH if nvPath is not found.
           TSS2_FAPI_RC_AUTHORIZATION_FAILED if authorization fails.
           TSS2_FAPI_RC_AUTHORIZATION_UNKNOWN if don't know how to authenticate.
           TSS2_FAPI_RC_NV_NOT_READABLE if the NV is not a readable index.
           TSS2_FAPI_RC_BAD_SEQUENCE if the context has an asynchronous operation already pending.
           TSS2_FAPI_RC_IO_ERROR if the data cannot be saved.
           TSS2_FAPI_RC_MEMORY if the FAPI cannot allocate enough memory for internal operations or return parameters.
           TSS2_FAPI_RC_NO_TPM if FAPI was initialized in no-TPM-mode via its config file.
           TSS2_FAPI_RC_PATH_NOT_FOUND if a FAPI object path was not found during authorization.
           TSS2_FAPI_RC_KEY_NOT_FOUND if a key was not found.
           TSS2_FAPI_RC_BAD_VALUE if an invalid value was passed into the function.
           TSS2_FAPI_RC_NOT_PROVISIONED FAPI was not provisioned.
