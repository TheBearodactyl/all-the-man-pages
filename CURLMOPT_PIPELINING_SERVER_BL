NAME
       CURLMOPT_PIPELINING_SERVER_BL - pipelining server block list

SYNOPSIS
       #include <curl/curl.h>

       CURLMcode curl_multi_setopt(CURLM *handle, CURLMOPT_PIPELINING_SERVER_BL,
                                   char **servers);

DESCRIPTION
       No function since pipelining was removed in 7.62.0.

       Pass a servers array of char *, ending with a NULL entry. This is a list of server types prefixes (in the Server: HTTP header) that are blocked from pipelining, i.e server types that are known to
       not support HTTP pipelining. The array is copied by libcurl.

       Note that the comparison matches if the Server: header begins with the string in the block list, i.e "Server: Ninja 1.2.3" and "Server: Ninja 1.4.0" can both be blocked by having "Ninja"  in  the
       list.

       Pass a NULL pointer to clear the block list.

DEFAULT
       The default value is NULL, which means that there is no block list.

PROTOCOLS
EXAMPLE
         char *server_block_list[] =

           "nginx/0.8.54",
           NULL
         };

         curl_multi_setopt(m, CURLMOPT_PIPELINING_SERVER_BL, server_block_list);

AVAILABILITY
       Added in 7.30.0

RETURN VALUE
       Returns CURLM_OK if the option is supported, and CURLM_UNKNOWN_OPTION if not.
