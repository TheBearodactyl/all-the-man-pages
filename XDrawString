NAME
       XDrawString, XDrawString16 - draw text characters

SYNTAX
       int XDrawString(Display *display, Drawable d, GC gc, int x, int y, _Xconst char *string, int length);

       int XDrawString16(Display *display, Drawable d, GC gc, int x, int y, _Xconst XChar2b *string, int length);

ARGUMENTS
       d         Specifies the drawable.

       display   Specifies the connection to the X server.

       gc        Specifies the GC.

       length    Specifies the number of characters in the string argument.

       string    Specifies the character string.

       x
       y         Specify the x and y coordinates, which are relative to the origin of the specified drawable and define the origin of the first character.

DESCRIPTION
       Each  character  image,  as defined by the font in the GC, is treated as an additional mask for a fill operation on the drawable.  The drawable is modified only where the font character has a bit
       set to 1.  For fonts defined with 2-byte matrix indexing and used with XDrawString16, each byte is used as a byte2 with a byte1 of zero.

       Both functions use these GC components: function, plane-mask, fill-style, font, subwindow-mode, clip-x-origin, clip-y-origin, and clip-mask.  They also use  these  GC  mode-dependent  components:
       foreground, background, tile, stipple, tile-stipple-x-origin, and tile-stipple-y-origin.

       XDrawString and XDrawString16 can generate BadDrawable, BadGC, and BadMatch errors.

DIAGNOSTICS
       BadDrawable
                 A value for a Drawable argument does not name a defined Window or Pixmap.

       BadGC     A value for a GContext argument does not name a defined GContext.

       BadMatch  An InputOnly window is used as a Drawable.

       BadMatch  Some argument or pair of arguments has the correct type and range but fails to match in some other way required by the request.
