RIPEMD160_INIT(3ssl)                OpenSSL               RIPEMD160_INIT(3ssl)

NAME
       RIPEMD160, RIPEMD160_Init, RIPEMD160_Update, RIPEMD160_Final -
       RIPEMD-160 hash function

SYNOPSIS
        #include <openssl/ripemd.h>

       The following functions have been deprecated since OpenSSL 3.0, and can
       be hidden entirely by defining OPENSSL_API_COMPAT with a suitable
       version value, see openssl_user_macros(7):

        unsigned char *RIPEMD160(const unsigned char *d, unsigned long n,
                                 unsigned char *md);

        int RIPEMD160_Init(RIPEMD160_CTX *c);
        int RIPEMD160_Update(RIPEMD160_CTX *c, const void *data, unsigned long len);
        int RIPEMD160_Final(unsigned char *md, RIPEMD160_CTX *c);

DESCRIPTION
       All of the functions described on this page are deprecated.
       Applications should instead use EVP_DigestInit_ex(3),
       EVP_DigestUpdate(3) and EVP_DigestFinal_ex(3).

       RIPEMD-160 is a cryptographic hash function with a 160 bit output.

       RIPEMD160() computes the RIPEMD-160 message digest of the n bytes at d
       and places it in md (which must have space for RIPEMD160_DIGEST_LENGTH
       == 20 bytes of output). If md is NULL, the digest is placed in a static
       array.

       The following functions may be used if the message is not completely
       stored in memory:

       RIPEMD160_Init() initializes a RIPEMD160_CTX structure.

       RIPEMD160_Update() can be called repeatedly with chunks of the message
       to be hashed (len bytes at data).

       RIPEMD160_Final() places the message digest in md, which must have
       space for RIPEMD160_DIGEST_LENGTH == 20 bytes of output, and erases the
       RIPEMD160_CTX.

RETURN VALUES
       RIPEMD160() returns a pointer to the hash value.

       RIPEMD160_Init(), RIPEMD160_Update() and RIPEMD160_Final() return 1 for
       success, 0 otherwise.

NOTE
       Applications should use the higher level functions EVP_DigestInit(3)
       etc. instead of calling these functions directly.
