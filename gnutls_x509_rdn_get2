NAME
       gnutls_x509_rdn_get2 - API function

SYNOPSIS
       #include <gnutls/x509.h>

       int gnutls_x509_rdn_get2(const gnutls_datum_t * idn, gnutls_datum_t * str, unsigned flags);

ARGUMENTS
       const gnutls_datum_t * idn
                   should contain a DER encoded RDN sequence

       gnutls_datum_t * str
                   a datum that will hold the name

       unsigned flags
                   zero of GNUTLS_X509_DN_FLAG_COMPAT

DESCRIPTION
       This function will return the name of the given RDN sequence.  The name will be in the form "C=xxxx,O=yyyy,CN=zzzz" as described in RFC4514.

       When the flag GNUTLS_X509_DN_FLAG_COMPAT is specified, the output format will match the format output by previous to 3.5.6 versions of GnuTLS which was not not fully RFC4514-compliant.

RETURNS
       On success, GNUTLS_E_SUCCESS (0) is returned, or GNUTLS_E_SHORT_MEMORY_BUFFER is returned and * buf_size is updated if the provided buffer is not long enough, otherwise a negative error value.
