NAME
       CURLOPT_DNS_SHUFFLE_ADDRESSES - shuffle IP addresses for hostname

SYNOPSIS
       #include <curl/curl.h>

       CURLcode curl_easy_setopt(CURL *handle, CURLOPT_DNS_SHUFFLE_ADDRESSES, long onoff);

DESCRIPTION
       When  a name is resolved and more than one IP address is returned, shuffle the order of all returned addresses so that they will be used in a random order.  This is similar to the ordering behav‚Äê
       ior of gethostbyname which is no longer used on most platforms.

       Addresses will not be reshuffled if a name resolution is completed using the DNS cache. CURLOPT_DNS_CACHE_TIMEOUT(3) can be used together with this option to reduce DNS cache timeout  or  disable
       caching entirely if frequent reshuffling is needed.

       Since the addresses returned will be reordered randomly, their order will not be in accordance with RFC 3484 or any other deterministic order that may be generated by the system's name resolution
       implementation. This may have performance impacts and may cause IPv4 to be used before IPv6 or vice versa.

DEFAULT
       0 (disabled)

PROTOCOLS
       All

EXAMPLE
       CURL *curl = curl_easy_init();
       if(curl) {
         curl_easy_setopt(curl, CURLOPT_URL, "https://example.com");
         curl_easy_setopt(curl, CURLOPT_DNS_SHUFFLE_ADDRESSES, 1L);

         curl_easy_perform(curl);

         /* always cleanup */
         curl_easy_cleanup(curl);
       }
