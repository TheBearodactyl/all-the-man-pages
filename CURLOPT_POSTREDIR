NAME
       CURLOPT_POSTREDIR - how to act on an HTTP POST redirect

SYNOPSIS
       #include <curl/curl.h>

       CURLcode curl_easy_setopt(CURL *handle, CURLOPT_POSTREDIR,
                                 long bitmask);

DESCRIPTION
       Pass  a bitmask to control how libcurl acts on redirects after POSTs that get a 301, 302 or 303 response back.  A parameter with bit 0 set (value CURL_REDIR_POST_301) tells the library to respect
       RFC 7231 (section 6.4.2 to 6.4.4) and not convert POST requests into GET requests when following a 301 redirection.  Setting bit 1 (value CURL_REDIR_POST_302) makes libcurl maintain  the  request
       method  after a 302 redirect whilst setting bit 2 (value CURL_REDIR_POST_303) makes libcurl maintain the request method after a 303 redirect. The value CURL_REDIR_POST_ALL is a convenience define
       that sets all three bits.

       The non-RFC behavior is ubiquitous in web browsers, so the library does the conversion by default to maintain consistency. However, a server may require a POST to remain a POST after such a redi‚Äê
       rection. This option is meaningful only when setting CURLOPT_FOLLOWLOCATION(3).

DEFAULT
       0

PROTOCOLS
       HTTP(S)

EXAMPLE
       CURL *curl = curl_easy_init();
       if(curl) {
         curl_easy_setopt(curl, CURLOPT_URL, "https://example.com");

         /* a silly POST example */
         curl_easy_setopt(curl, CURLOPT_POSTFIELDS, "data=true");

         /* example.com is redirected, so we tell libcurl to send POST on 301, 302 and
            303 HTTP response codes */
         curl_easy_setopt(curl, CURLOPT_POSTREDIR, CURL_REDIR_POST_ALL);

         curl_easy_perform(curl);
       }

AVAILABILITY
       Added in 7.17.1. This option was known as CURLOPT_POST301 up to 7.19.0 as it only supported the 301 then. CURL_REDIR_POST_303 was added in 7.26.0.

RETURN VALUE
       Returns CURLE_OK if the option is supported, and CURLE_UNKNOWN_OPTION if not.
