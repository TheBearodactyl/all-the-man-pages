CURLINFO_FILETIME(3)                                                                     curl_easy_getinfo options                                                                    CURLINFO_FILETIME(3)

NAME
       CURLINFO_FILETIME - get the remote time of the retrieved document

SYNOPSIS
       #include <curl/curl.h>

       CURLcode curl_easy_getinfo(CURL *handle, CURLINFO_FILETIME, long *timep);

DESCRIPTION
       Pass  a pointer to a long to receive the remote time of the retrieved document in number of seconds since January 1 1970 in the GMT/UTC time zone. If you get -1, it can be because of many reasons
       (it might be unknown, the server might hide it or the server does not support the command that tells document time etc) and the time of the document is unknown.

       You must tell libcurl to collect this information before the transfer is made, by using the CURLOPT_FILETIME(3) option to curl_easy_setopt(3) or you will unconditionally get a -1 back.

       Consider using CURLINFO_FILETIME_T(3) to be able to extract dates beyond the year 2038 on systems using 32 bit longs.

PROTOCOLS
       HTTP(S), FTP(S), SFTP

EXAMPLE
       curl = curl_easy_init();
       if(curl) {
         curl_easy_setopt(curl, CURLOPT_URL, url);
         /* Ask for filetime */
         curl_easy_setopt(curl, CURLOPT_FILETIME, 1L);
         res = curl_easy_perform(curl);
         if(CURLE_OK == res) {
           res = curl_easy_getinfo(curl, CURLINFO_FILETIME, &filetime);
           if((CURLE_OK == res) && (filetime >= 0)) {
             time_t file_time = (time_t)filetime;
             printf("filetime %s: %s", filename, ctime(&file_time));
           }
         }
         /* always cleanup */
         curl_easy_cleanup(curl);
       }
