NAME
       Test2::EventFacet::Parent - Facet for events contains other events

DESCRIPTION
       This facet is used when an event contains other events, such as a subtest.

FIELDS
       $string = $parent->{details}
       $string = $parent->details()
           Human readable description of the event.

       $hid = $parent->{hid}
       $hid = $parent->hid()
           Hub ID of the hub that is represented in the parent-child relationship.

       $arrayref = $parent->{children}
       $arrayref = $parent->children()
           Arrayref containing the facet-data hashes of events nested under this one.

           To get the actual events you need to get them from the parent event directly

       $bool = $parent->{buffered}
       $bool = $parent->buffered()
           True if the subtest is buffered (meaning the formatter has probably not seen them yet).
