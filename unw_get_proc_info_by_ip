NAME
       unw_get_proc_info_by_ip -- get procedure info by IP

SYNOPSIS
       #include <libunwind.h>

       int unw_get_proc_info_by_ip(unw_addr_space_t as, unw_word_t ip, unw_proc_info_t *pip, void *arg);

DESCRIPTION
       The  unw_get_proc_info_by_ip()  routine  returns the same kind of auxiliary information about a procedure as unw_get_proc_info(), except that the info is looked up by instruction-pointer (IP) in‐
       stead of a cursor. This is more flexible because it is possible to look up the info for an arbitrary procedure, even if it is not part of the current call-chain. However, since it is more  flexi‐
       ble, it also tends to run slower (and often much slower) than unw_get_proc_info().

       The  routine  expects the followins arguments: as is the address-space in which the instruction-pointer should be looked up.  For a look-up in the local address-space, unw_local_addr_space can be
       passed for this argument.  Argument ip is the instruction-pointer for which the procedure info should be looked up and pip is a pointer to a structure of type unw_proc_info_t which is used to re‐
       turn  the  info.   Lastly,  arg is the address-space argument that should be used when accessing the address-space. It has the same purpose as the argument of the same name for unw_init_remote().
       When accessing the local address-space (first argument is unw_local_addr_space), NULL must be passed for this argument.

       Note that for the purposes of libunwind, the code of a procedure is assumed to occupy a single, contiguous range of addresses. For this reason, it is alwas possible to describe the  extent  of  a
       procedure with the start_ip and end_ip members. If a single function/routine is split into multiple, discontiguous pieces, libunwind will treat each piece as a separate procedure.

RETURN VALUE
       On successful completion, unw_get_proc_info_by_ip() returns 0. Otherwise the negative value of one of the error-codes below is returned.

THREAD AND SIGNAL SAFETY
       unw_get_proc_info() is thread-safe. If the local address-space is passed in argument as, this routine is also safe to use from a signal handler.

ERRORS
       UNW_EUNSPEC
               An unspecified error occurred.

       UNW_ENOINFO
               Libunwind was unable to locate unwind-info for the procedure.

       UNW_EBADVERSION
               The unwind-info for the procedure has version or format that is not understood by libunwind.

       In addition, unw_get_proc_info() may return any error returned by the access_mem() call-back (see unw_create_addr_space(3)).
