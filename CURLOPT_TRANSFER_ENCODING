NAME
       CURLOPT_TRANSFER_ENCODING - ask for HTTP Transfer Encoding

SYNOPSIS
       #include <curl/curl.h>

       CURLcode curl_easy_setopt(CURL *handle, CURLOPT_TRANSFER_ENCODING,
                                 long enable);

DESCRIPTION
       Pass a long set to 1L to enable or 0 to disable.

       Adds  a  request for compressed Transfer Encoding in the outgoing HTTP request. If the server supports this and so desires, it can respond with the HTTP response sent using a compressed Transfer-
       Encoding that will be automatically uncompressed by libcurl on reception.

       Transfer-Encoding differs slightly from the Content-Encoding you ask for with CURLOPT_ACCEPT_ENCODING(3) in that a Transfer-Encoding is strictly meant to be for the transfer and thus MUST be  de‚Äê
       coded before the data arrives in the client. Traditionally, Transfer-Encoding has been much less used and supported by both HTTP clients and HTTP servers.

DEFAULT
       0

PROTOCOLS
       HTTP

EXAMPLE

         curl_easy_perform(curl);
       }
