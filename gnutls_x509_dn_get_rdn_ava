NAME
       gnutls_x509_dn_get_rdn_ava - API function

SYNOPSIS
       #include <gnutls/x509.h>

       int gnutls_x509_dn_get_rdn_ava(gnutls_x509_dn_t dn, int irdn, int iava, gnutls_x509_ava_st * ava);

ARGUMENTS
       gnutls_x509_dn_t dn
                   a pointer to DN

       int irdn    index of RDN

       int iava    index of AVA.

       gnutls_x509_ava_st * ava
                   Pointer to structure which will hold output information.

DESCRIPTION
       Get pointers to data within the DN. The format of the  ava structure is shown below.

       struct gnutls_x509_ava_st { gnutls_datum_t oid; gnutls_datum_t value; unsigned long value_tag; };

       The X.509 distinguished name is a sequence of sequences of strings and this is what the  irdn and  iava indexes model.

       Note that  ava will contain pointers into the  dn structure which in turns points to the original certificate. Thus you should not modify any data or deallocate any of those.

       This is a low-level function that requires the caller to do the value conversions when necessary (e.g. from UCS-2).

RETURNS
       Returns 0 on success, or an error code.
