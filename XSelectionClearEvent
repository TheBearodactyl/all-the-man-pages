NAME
       XSelectionClearEvent - SelectionClear event structure

STRUCTURES
       The structure for SelectionClear events contains:

       typedef struct {
               int type;       /* SelectionClear */
               unsigned long serial;   /* # of last request processed by server */
               Bool send_event;        /* true if this came from a SendEvent request */
               Display *display;       /* Display the event was read from */
               Window window;
               Atom selection;
               Time time;
       } XSelectionClearEvent;

       When you receive this event, the structure members are set as follows.

       The  type  member is set to the event type constant name that uniquely identifies it.  For example, when the X server reports a GraphicsExpose event to a client application, it sends an XGraphic‐
       sExposeEvent structure with the type member set to GraphicsExpose.  The display member is set to a pointer to the display the event was read on.  The send_event member is set to True if the event
       came  from a SendEvent protocol request.  The serial member is set from the serial number reported in the protocol but expanded from the 16-bit least-significant bits to a full 32-bit value.  The
       window member is set to the window that is most useful to toolkit dispatchers.

       The selection member is set to the selection atom.  The time member is set to the last change time recorded for the selection.  The window member is the window that was specified by  the  current
       owner (the owner losing the selection) in its XSetSelectionOwner call.
