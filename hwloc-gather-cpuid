NAME
       hwloc-gather-cpuid - Dumps the relevant x86 cpuid values for later (possibly offline) usage

SYNOPSIS
       hwloc-gather-cpuid [options] [<outdir>]

OPTIONS
       -c <idx>
              Only gather cpuid values for logical processor whose OS/physical index is <idx>.

       -s --silent
              Do not show verbose messages.

       --version
              Report version and exit.

       -h --help
              Display help message and exit.

DESCRIPTION
       hwloc-gather-cpuid dumps all the relevant x86 cpuid values into subdirectory cpuid of current directory, or in <outdir> if specified.

       These files can be used later to explore the machine topology offline, for instance by setting the environment variable HWLOC_CPUID_PATH to the directory containing all output files, and by forc‐
       ing the x86 backend with HWLOC_COMPONENTS=x86,stop.

       The directory contents may also be submitted to hwloc developers to debug issues remotely.

       If - is used as <outdir>, the output is dumped to the standard output, but a unique logical processor must have been given with -c.

       hwloc-gather-cpuid is a x86 specific tool, it cannot be used on other platforms.

       NOTE: hwloc-gather-cpuid gathers many hardware details about the platform.  Output files should not be posted on public lists or websites unless it is clear that they contain no sensitive  infor‐
       mation.

       NOTE: The output of hwloc-gather-cpuid is included in the tarball saved by hwloc-gather-topology on Linux/x86.

       NOTE: It is highly recommended that you read the hwloc(7) overview page before reading this man page.

EXAMPLES
       To store cpuid information of all logical processors of the current machine:

               $ hwloc-gather-cpuid
               Gathering in directory ./cpuid ...
               Gathering CPUID of PU P#0 in path ./hwloc-x86-cpuid/pu0 ...
               Gathering CPUID of PU P#1 in path ./hwloc-x86-cpuid/pu1 ...
               Gathering CPUID of PU P#2 in path ./hwloc-x86-cpuid/pu2 ...
               Gathering CPUID of PU P#3 in path ./hwloc-x86-cpuid/pu3 ...
               Summary written to ./cpuid/hwloc-cpuid-info

RETURN VALUE
       Upon successful execution, hwloc-gather-cpuid will exit with the code 0.

       hwloc-gather-cpuid will return nonzero exit status if any kind of error occurs, such as (but not limited to) failure to create the output files.
