NAME
       cproj, cprojf, cprojl - project into Riemann Sphere

LIBRARY
       Math library (libm, -lm)

SYNOPSIS
       #include <complex.h>

       double complex cproj(double complex z);
       float complex cprojf(float complex z);
       long double complex cprojl(long double complex z);

DESCRIPTION
       These  functions  project a point in the plane onto the surface of a Riemann Sphere, the one-point compactification of the complex plane.  Each finite point z projects to z itself.  Every complex
       infinite value is projected to a single infinite value, namely to positive infinity on the real axis.

HISTORY
       glibc 2.1.  C99, POSIX.1-2001.

       In glibc 2.11 and earlier, the implementation does something different (a stereographic projection onto a Riemann Sphere).

NAME
       cproj, cprojf, cprojl — complex projection functions

SYNOPSIS
       #include <complex.h>

       double complex cproj(double complex z);
       float complex cprojf(float complex z);
       long double complex cprojl(long double complex z);

DESCRIPTION
       The functionality described on this reference page is aligned with the ISO C standard. Any conflict between the requirements described here and the ISO C standard is unintentional. This volume of
       POSIX.1‐2017 defers to the ISO C standard.

       These  functions shall compute a projection of z onto the Riemann sphere: z projects to z, except that all complex infinities (even those with one infinite part and one NaN part) project to posi‐
       tive infinity on the real axis. If z has an infinite part, then cproj(z) shall be equivalent to:

           INFINITY + I * copysign(0.0, cimag(z))

RETURN VALUE
       These functions shall return the value of the projection onto the Riemann sphere.

ERRORS
       No errors are defined.

       The following sections are informative.

EXAMPLES
       None.

APPLICATION USAGE
       None.

RATIONALE
       Two topologies are commonly used in complex mathematics: the complex plane with its continuum of infinities, and the Riemann sphere with its single infinity. The complex plane  is  better  suited
       for  transcendental functions, the Riemann sphere for algebraic functions. The complex types with their multiplicity of infinities provide a useful (though imperfect) model for the complex plane.
       The cproj() function helps model the Riemann sphere by mapping all infinities to one, and should be used just before any operation, especially comparisons, that might give  spurious  results  for
       any  of  the other infinities. Note that a complex value with one infinite part and one NaN part is regarded as an infinity, not a NaN, because if one part is infinite, the complex value is infi‐
       nite independent of the value of the other part. For the same reason, cabs() returns an infinity if its argument has an infinite part and a NaN part.

FUTURE DIRECTIONS
       None.
