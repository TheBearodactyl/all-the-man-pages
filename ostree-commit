OSTREE COMMIT(1)                 ostree commit                OSTREE COMMIT(1)

NAME
       ostree-commit - Commit a new revision

SYNOPSIS
       ostree commit [OPTIONS...] --branch= {BRANCH} [PATH]

DESCRIPTION
       This allows you to commit changes to a branch. The specification of the
       branch is required. The command will print the checksum of a successful
       commit.

OPTIONS
       --subject, -s="SUBJECT"
           One line subject. (optional)

       --body, -m="BODY"
           Full description. (optional)

       --body-file, -F="FILE"
           Full commit description from a file. (optional)

       --editor, -e
           Open a text editor for the commit description. It will use
           OSTREE_EDITOR, VISUAL, EDITOR, or vi, in descending order of
           preference. The commit will be aborted if the message is left
           empty.

       --branch, -b="BRANCH"
           Branch. Required, unless --orphan is given.

       --parent="COMMIT"
           Parent checksum or "none" to explicitly use no parent. If not
           specified, BRANCH is used as parent (no parent in case BRANCH does
           not exist).

       --tree="dir=PATH" or "tar=TARFILE" or "ref=COMMIT"
           Overlay the given argument as a tree. When committing an archive,
           the TARFILE can be specified as - to read the archive from standard
           input.

       --base="REV"
           Start from the content in a commit. This differs from
           --tree=ref=REV in that no commit modifiers are applied. This is
           usually what you want when creating a derived commit. This is also
           used for --selinux-policy-from-base.

       --add-metadata-string="KEY=VALUE"
           Add a key/value pair to metadata. Can be specified multiple times.

       --add-metadata="KEY=VALUE"
           Add a key/value pair to metadata, where the KEY is a string, and
           VALUE is g_variant_parse() formatted. Can be specified multiple
           times.

       --keep-metadata="KEY"
           Keep metadata KEY and its associated VALUE from parent. Can be
           specified multiple times.

       --add-detached-metadata-string="KEY=VALUE"
           Add a key/value pair to detached metadata.

       --owner-uid="UID"
           Set file ownership user id.

       --owner-gid="GID"
           Set file ownership group id.

       --no-xattrs
           Do not import extended attributes.

       --bootable
           Inject standard metadata for a bootable Linux filesystem tree.

       --link-checkout-speedup
           Optimize for commits of trees composed of hardlinks into the
           repository.

       --tar-autocreate-parents
           When loading tar archives, automatically create parent directories
           as needed.

       --skip-if-unchanged
           If the contents are unchanged from previous commit, do nothing.

       --consume
           When committing from a local directory (i.e. not an archive or
           --tree=ref), assume ownership of the content. This may simply
           involve deleting it, but if possible, the content may simply be
           rename()ed into the repository rather than creating a new copy.

       --statoverride="PATH"
           File containing list of modifications to make permissions (file
           mode in decimal, followed by space, followed by file path). The
           specified mode is ORed with the file's original mode unless
           preceded by "=".

       --skip-list="PATH"
           File containing list of file paths to skip (one path per line).

       --table-output
           Output more information in a KEY: VALUE format.

       --generate-sizes
           Generate size information along with commit metadata.

       --gpg-sign="KEY-ID"
           GPG Key ID with which to sign the commit (if have GPGME - GNU
           Privacy Guard Made Easy).

       --gpg-homedir="HOMEDIR"
           GPG home directory to use when looking for keyrings (if have GPGME
           - GNU Privacy Guard Made Easy).

       --timestamp="TIMESTAMP"
           Override the timestamp of the commit to TIMESTAMP.

       --orphan
           Create a commit without writing to a ref (branch)

       --fsync="POLICY"
           POLICY is a boolean which specifies whether fsync should be used or
           not. Default to true.

       -s, --sign-type
           Use particular signature engine. Currently available ed25519 and
           dummy signature types. The default is ed25519.

       --sign="KEY-ID"
           There KEY-ID is:

           for ed25519:
               base64-encoded secret key for commit signing.

           for dummy:
               ASCII-string used as secret key.

EXAMPLE
       $ ostree commit --branch=my-branch --subject="Initial commit"
