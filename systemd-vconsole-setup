SYSTEMD-VCONSOLE-SETUP.SERVICE(8)                                                     systemd-vconsole-setup.service                                                     SYSTEMD-VCONSOLE-SETUP.SERVICE(8)

NAME
       systemd-vconsole-setup.service, systemd-vconsole-setup - Configure the virtual consoles

SYNOPSIS
       systemd-vconsole-setup.service

       /usr/lib/systemd/systemd-vconsole-setup [TTY]

DESCRIPTION
       systemd-vconsole-setup sets up and configures either all virtual consoles, or — if the optional TTY parameter is provided — a specific one. When the system is booting up, it's called by systemd-
       udevd(8) during VT console subsystem initialization. Also, systemd-localed.service(8) invokes it as needed when language or console changes are made. Internally, this program calls loadkeys(1)
       and setfont(8).

       Execute systemctl restart systemd-vconsole-setup.service in order to apply any manual changes made to /etc/vconsole.conf.

       See vconsole.conf(5) for information about the configuration files and kernel command line options understood by this program.

CREDENTIALS
       systemd-vconsole-setup supports the service credentials logic as implemented by LoadCredential=/SetCredential= (see systemd.exec(1) for details). The following credentials are used when passed
       in:

       vconsole.keymap, vconsole.keymap_toggle
           The keymap (and toggle keymap) to apply. The matching options in vconsole.conf and on the kernel command line take precedence over these credentials.

           Note the relationship to the firstboot.keymap credential understood by systemd-firstboot.service(8): both ultimately affect the same setting, but firstboot.keymap is written into
           /etc/vconsole.conf on first boot (if not already configured), and then read from there by systemd-vconsole-setup, while vconsole.keymap is read on every boot, and is not persisted to disk
           (but any configuration in vconsole.conf will take precedence if present).

       vconsole.font, vconsole.font_map, vconsole.font_unimap
           The console font settings to apply. The matching options in vconsole.conf and on the kernel command line take precedence over these credentials.
