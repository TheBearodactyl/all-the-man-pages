NAME
       XkbSetXlibControls - Changes the state of the Library Controls

SYNOPSIS
       unsigned int XkbSetXlibControls (Display *display, unsigned long bits_to_change, unsigned long values_for_bits);

ARGUMENTS
       display
              connection to X server

       bits_to_change
              selects controls to be modified

       values_for_bits
              turns selected controls on (1) or off (0)

DESCRIPTION
       XkbSetXlibControls  modifies  the  state  of  the  controls  selected  by bits_to_change; only the controls selected by bits_to_change are modified. If the bit corresponding to a control is on in
       bits_to_change and also on in values_for_bits, the control is enabled. If the bit corresponding to a control is on  in  bits_to_change  but  off  in  values_for_bits,  the  control  is  disabled.
       bits_to_change should be an inclusive OR of bits from Table 1.
