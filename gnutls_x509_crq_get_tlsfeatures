NAME
       gnutls_x509_crq_get_tlsfeatures - API function

SYNOPSIS
       #include <gnutls/x509.h>

       int gnutls_x509_crq_get_tlsfeatures(gnutls_x509_crq_t crq, gnutls_x509_tlsfeatures_t features, unsigned int flags, unsigned int * critical);

ARGUMENTS
       gnutls_x509_crq_t crq
                   An X.509 certificate request

       gnutls_x509_tlsfeatures_t features
                   If the function succeeds, the features will be stored in this variable.

       unsigned int flags
                   zero or GNUTLS_EXT_FLAG_APPEND

       unsigned int * critical
                   the extension status

DESCRIPTION
       This function will get the X.509 TLS features extension structure from the certificate request.  The returned structure needs to be freed using gnutls_x509_tlsfeatures_deinit().

       When the  flags is set to GNUTLS_EXT_FLAG_APPEND, then if the  features structure is empty this function will behave identically as if the flag was not set. Otherwise if there are elements in the
       features structure then they will be merged with.

       Note that  features must be initialized prior to calling this function.

RETURNS
       On success, GNUTLS_E_SUCCESS (0) is returned, otherwise a negative error value.

SINCE
       3.5.1
