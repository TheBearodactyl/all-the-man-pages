NAME
       Test2::EventFacet::Render - Facet that dictates how to render an event.

DESCRIPTION
       This facet is used to dictate how the event should be rendered by the standard test2 rendering tools. If this facet is present then ONLY what is specified by it will be rendered. It is assumed
       that anything important or note-worthy will be present here, no other facets will be considered for rendering/display.

       This facet is a list type, you can add as many items as needed.

FIELDS
       $string = $render->[#]->{details}
       $string = $render->[#]->details()
           Human readable text for display.

       $string = $render->[#]->{tag}
       $string = $render->[#]->tag()
           Tag that should prefix/identify the main text.

       $string = $render->[#]->{facet}
       $string = $render->[#]->facet()
           Optional, if the display text was generated from another facet this should state what facet it was.

       $mode = $render->[#]->{mode}
       $mode = $render->[#]->mode()
           calculated
               Calculated means the facet was generated from another facet. Calculated facets may be cleared and regenerated whenever the event state changes.

           replace
               Replace means the facet is intended to replace the normal rendering of the event.
