NAME
       gnutls_system_recv_timeout - API function

SYNOPSIS
       #include <gnutls/gnutls.h>

       int gnutls_system_recv_timeout(gnutls_transport_ptr_t ptr, unsigned int ms);

ARGUMENTS
       gnutls_transport_ptr_t ptr
                   A file descriptor (wrapped in a gnutls_transport_ptr_t pointer)

       unsigned int ms
                   The number of milliseconds to wait.

DESCRIPTION
       Wait for data to be received from the provided socket ( ptr ) within a timeout period in milliseconds, using select() on the provided  ptr .

       This function is provided as a helper for constructing custom callbacks for gnutls_transport_set_pull_timeout_function(), which can be used if you rely on socket file descriptors.

       Returns -1 on error, 0 on timeout, positive value if data are available for reading.

SINCE
       3.4.0
