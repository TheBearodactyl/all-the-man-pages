NAME
       CURLMOPT_PIPELINING_SITE_BL - pipelining host block list

SYNOPSIS
       #include <curl/curl.h>

       CURLMcode curl_multi_setopt(CURLM *handle, CURLMOPT_PIPELINING_SITE_BL,
                                   char **hosts);

DESCRIPTION
       No function since pipelining was removed in 7.62.0.

       Pass  a  hosts array of char *, ending with a NULL entry. This is a list of sites that are blocked from pipelining, i.e sites that are known to not support HTTP pipelining. The array is copied by
       libcurl.

       Pass a NULL pointer to clear the block list.

DEFAULT
       The default value is NULL, which means that there is no block list.

PROTOCOLS
       HTTP(S)

EXAMPLE
         char *site_block_list[] =
         {
           "www.haxx.se",
           "www.example.com:1234",
           NULL
         };

         curl_multi_setopt(m, CURLMOPT_PIPELINING_SITE_BL, site_block_list);

AVAILABILITY
       Added in 7.30.0

RETURN VALUE
       Returns CURLM_OK if the option is supported, and CURLM_UNKNOWN_OPTION if not.
