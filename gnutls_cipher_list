NAME
       gnutls_cipher_list - API function

SYNOPSIS
       #include <gnutls/gnutls.h>

       const gnutls_cipher_algorithm_t * gnutls_cipher_list( void);

ARGUMENTS
        void

DESCRIPTION
       Get  a  list  of supported cipher algorithms.  Note that not necessarily all ciphers are supported as TLS cipher suites.  For example, DES is not supported as a cipher suite, but is supported for
       other purposes (e.g., PKCS8 or similar).

       This function is not thread safe.

RETURNS
       a (0)-terminated list of gnutls_cipher_algorithm_t integers indicating the available ciphers.
