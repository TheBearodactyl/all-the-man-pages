NAME
       DH_new, DH_free - allocate and free DH objects

SYNOPSIS
        #include <openssl/dh.h>

       The following functions have been deprecated since OpenSSL 3.0, and can be hidden entirely by defining OPENSSL_API_COMPAT with a suitable version value, see openssl_user_macros(7):

        DH* DH_new(void);

        void DH_free(DH *dh);

DESCRIPTION
       DH_new() allocates and initializes a DH structure.

       DH_free() frees the DH structure and its components. The values are erased before the memory is returned to the system.  If dh is NULL nothing is done.

RETURN VALUES
       If the allocation fails, DH_new() returns NULL and sets an error code that can be obtained by ERR_get_error(3). Otherwise it returns a pointer to the newly allocated structure.

       DH_free() returns no value.

SEE ALSO
       DH_new(3), ERR_get_error(3), DH_generate_parameters(3), DH_generate_key(3), EVP_PKEY-DH(7)

HISTORY
       All of these functions were deprecated in OpenSSL 3.0.

       For replacement see EVP_PKEY-DH(7).
