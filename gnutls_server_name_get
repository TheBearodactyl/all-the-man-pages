NAME
       gnutls_server_name_get - API function

SYNOPSIS
       #include <gnutls/gnutls.h>

       int gnutls_server_name_get(gnutls_session_t session, void * data, size_t * data_length, unsigned int * type, unsigned int indx);

ARGUMENTS
       gnutls_session_t session
                   is a gnutls_session_t type.

       void * data will hold the data

       size_t * data_length
                   will hold the data length. Must hold the maximum size of data.

       unsigned int * type
                   will hold the server name indicator type

       unsigned int indx
                   is the index of the server_name

DESCRIPTION
       This function will allow you to get the name indication (if any), a client has sent.  The name indication may be any of the enumeration gnutls_server_name_type_t.

       If  type is GNUTLS_NAME_DNS, then this function is to be used by servers that support virtual hosting, and the data will be a null terminated IDNA ACE string (prior to GnuTLS 3.4.0 it was a UTF-8
       string).

       If  data has not enough size to hold the server name GNUTLS_E_SHORT_MEMORY_BUFFER is returned, and  data_length will hold the required size.

        indx is used to retrieve more than one server names (if sent by the client).  The first server name has an index of 0, the second  1  and  so  on.   If  no  name  with  the  given  index  exists
       GNUTLS_E_REQUESTED_DATA_NOT_AVAILABLE is returned.

RETURNS
       On success, GNUTLS_E_SUCCESS (0) is returned, on UTF-8 decoding error GNUTLS_E_IDNA_ERROR is returned, otherwise a negative error code is returned.
