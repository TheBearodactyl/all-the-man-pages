NAME
       io_uring_submit_and_wait_timeout - submit requests to the submission queue and wait for the completion with timeout

SYNOPSIS
       #include <liburing.h>

       int io_uring_submit_and_wait_timeout(struct io_uring *ring,
                                            struct io_uring_cqe **cqe_ptr,
                                            unsigned wait_nr,
                                            struct __kernel_timespec *ts,
                                            sigset_t *sigmask);

DESCRIPTION
       The  io_uring_submit_and_wait_timeout(3)  function  submits  the next requests from the submission queue belonging to the ring and waits for wait_nr completion events, or until the timeout ts ex‚Äê
       pires. The completion events are stored in the cqe_ptr array. The sigmask specifies the set of signals to block. The prevailing signal mask is restored before returning.

       After the caller retrieves a submission queue entry (SQE) with io_uring_get_sqe(3) and prepares the SQE, it can be submitted with io_uring_submit_and_wait_timeout(3).

RETURN VALUE
       On success io_uring_submit_and_wait_timeout(3) returns the number of submitted submission queue entries. On failure it returns -errno.  Note that in earlier versions of the liburing library,  the
       return value was 0 on success.  The most common failure case is not receiving a completion within the specified timeout, -ETIME is returned in this case.
