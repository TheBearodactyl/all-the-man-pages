NAME
       Test2::IPC::Driver::Files - Temp dir + Files concurrency model.

DESCRIPTION
       This is the default, and fallback concurrency model for Test2. This sends events between processes and threads using serialized files in a temporary directory. This is not particularly fast, but
       it works everywhere.

SYNOPSIS
           use Test2::IPC::Driver::Files;

           # IPC is now enabled

ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
       T2_KEEP_TEMPDIR=0
           When true, the tempdir used by the IPC driver will not be deleted when the test is done.

       T2_TEMPDIR_TEMPLATE='test2-XXXXXX'
           This can be used to set the template for the IPC temp dir. The template should follow template specifications from File::Temp.

SEE ALSO
       See Test2::IPC::Driver for methods.
