NAME
       gnutls_x509_crt_get_fingerprint - API function

SYNOPSIS
       #include <gnutls/x509.h>

       int gnutls_x509_crt_get_fingerprint(gnutls_x509_crt_t cert, gnutls_digest_algorithm_t algo, void * buf, size_t * buf_size);

ARGUMENTS
       gnutls_x509_crt_t cert
                   should contain a gnutls_x509_crt_t type

       gnutls_digest_algorithm_t algo
                   is a digest algorithm

       void * buf  a pointer to a structure to hold the fingerprint (may be null)

       size_t * buf_size
                   initially holds the size of  buf

DESCRIPTION
       This function will calculate and copy the certificate's fingerprint in the provided buffer. The fingerprint is a hash of the DER-encoded data of the certificate.

       If the buffer is null then only the size will be filled.

RETURNS
       GNUTLS_E_SHORT_MEMORY_BUFFER if the provided buffer is not long enough, and in that case the *buf_size will be updated with the required size.  On success 0 is returned.
