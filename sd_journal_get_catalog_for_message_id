NAME
       sd_journal_get_catalog, sd_journal_get_catalog_for_message_id -
       Retrieve message catalog entry

SYNOPSIS
       #include <systemd/sd-journal.h>

       int sd_journal_get_catalog(sd_journal *j, char **ret);

       int sd_journal_get_catalog_for_message_id(sd_id128_t id, char **ret);

DESCRIPTION
       sd_journal_get_catalog() retrieves a message catalog entry for the
       current journal entry. This will look up an entry in the message
       catalog by using the "MESSAGE_ID=" field of the current journal entry.
       Before returning the entry all journal field names in the catalog entry
       text enclosed in "@" will be replaced by the respective field values of
       the current entry. If a field name referenced in the message catalog
       entry does not exist, in the current journal entry, the "@" will be
       removed, but the field name otherwise left untouched.

       sd_journal_get_catalog_for_message_id() works similar to
       sd_journal_get_catalog() but the entry is looked up by the specified
       message ID (no open journal context is necessary for this), and no
       field substitution is performed.

       For more information about the journal message catalog please refer to
       the Journal Message Catalogs[1] documentation page.

RETURN VALUE
       sd_journal_get_catalog() and sd_journal_get_catalog_for_message_id()
       return 0 on success or a negative errno-style error code. If no
       matching message catalog entry is found, -ENOENT is returned.

       On successful return, ret points to a new string, which must be freed
       with free(3).

NOTES
       Function sd_journal_get_catalog() is thread-agnostic and only a single
       specific thread may operate on a given object during its entire
       lifetime. It's safe to allocate multiple independent objects and use
       each from a specific thread in parallel. However, it's not safe to
       allocate such an object in one thread, and operate or free it from any
       other, even if locking is used to ensure these threads don't operate on
       it at the very same time.

       Function sd_journal_get_catalog_for_message_id() is are thread-safe and
       may be called in parallel from multiple threads.

       These APIs are implemented as a shared library, which can be compiled
       and linked to with the libsystemd pkg-config(1) file.
