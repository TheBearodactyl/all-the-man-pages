NAME
       sd_bus_message_skip - Skip elements in a bus message

SYNOPSIS
       #include <systemd/sd-bus.h>

       int sd_bus_message_skip(sd_bus_message *m, const char* types);

DESCRIPTION
       sd_bus_message_skip() is somewhat similar to sd_bus_message_read(3),
       but instead of reading the contents of the message, it only moves the
       "read pointer". Subsequent read operations will read the elements that
       are after the elements that were skipped.

       The types argument has the same meaning as in sd_bus_message_read(). It
       may also be NULL, to skip a single element of any type.

RETURN VALUE
       On success, sd_bus_message_skip() returns 0 or a positive integer. On
       failure, it returns a negative errno-style error code.

   Errors
       Returned errors may indicate the following problems:

       -EINVAL
           The m parameter is NULL.

       -EBADMSG
           The message cannot be parsed.

       -EPERM
           The message is not sealed.

       -ENXIO
           The message end has been reached and the requested elements cannot
           be read.

       -ENOMEM
           Memory allocation failed.

NOTES
       These APIs are implemented as a shared library, which can be compiled
       and linked to with the libsystemd pkg-config(1) file.
