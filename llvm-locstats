NAME
       llvm-locstats - calculate statistics on DWARF debug location

SYNOPSIS
       llvm-locstats [options] [filename]

DESCRIPTION
       llvm-locstats works like a wrapper around llvm-dwarfdump.  It parses llvm-dwarfdump statistics regarding debug location by pretty printing it in a more human readable way.

       The  line  0%  shows  the  number and the percentage of DIEs with no location information, but the line 100% shows the information for DIEs where there is location information in all code section
       bytes (where the variable or parameter is in the scope). The line [50%,60%) shows the number and the percentage of DIEs where the location information is between 50 and 60 percentage of its scope
       covered.

OPTIONS
       --only-variables
              calculate the location statistics only for local variables

       --only-formal-parameters
              calculate the location statistics only for formal parameters

       --ignore-debug-entry-values
              ignore the location statistics on locations containing the debug entry values DWARF operation

       --draw-plot
              make histogram of location buckets generated (requires matplotlib)

       --compare
              compare the debug location coverage on two files provided, and draw a plot showing the difference (requires matplotlib)

EXIT STATUS
       llvm-locstats returns 0 if the input file were parsed successfully. Otherwise, it returns 1.

EXAMPLE 1
       Pretty print the location coverage on the standard output.

          llvm-locstats a.out

EXAMPLE 2
       Generate a plot as an image file.

          llvm-locstats --draw-plot file1.out
       [image]

EXAMPLE 3
       Generate a plot as an image file showing the difference in the debug location coverage.

          llvm-locstats --compare file1.out file1.withentryvals.out
       [image]
