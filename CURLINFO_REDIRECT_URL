CURLINFO_REDIRECT_URL(3)                                                                 curl_easy_getinfo options                                                                CURLINFO_REDIRECT_URL(3)

NAME
       CURLINFO_REDIRECT_URL - get the URL a redirect would go to

SYNOPSIS
       #include <curl/curl.h>

       CURLcode curl_easy_getinfo(CURL *handle, CURLINFO_REDIRECT_URL, char **urlp);

DESCRIPTION
       Pass  a  pointer to a char pointer to receive the URL a redirect would take you to if you would enable CURLOPT_FOLLOWLOCATION(3). This can come handy if you think using the built-in libcurl redi‚Äê
       rect logic is not good enough for you but you would still prefer to avoid implementing all the magic of figuring out the new URL.

       This URL is also set if the CURLOPT_MAXREDIRS(3) limit prevented a redirect to happen (since 7.54.1).

PROTOCOLS
       HTTP(S)

EXAMPLE
       CURL *curl = curl_easy_init();
       if(curl) {
         CURLcode res;
         curl_easy_setopt(curl, CURLOPT_URL, "https://example.com");
         res = curl_easy_perform(curl);
         if(res == CURLE_OK) {
           char *url = NULL;
           curl_easy_getinfo(curl, CURLINFO_REDIRECT_URL, &url);
           if(url)
             printf("Redirect to: %s\n", url);
         }
         curl_easy_cleanup(curl);
       }

AVAILABILITY
       Added in 7.18.2

RETURN VALUE
       Returns CURLE_OK if the option is supported, and CURLE_UNKNOWN_OPTION if not.
