       If  where is NULL, the function returns the amount of memory needed for
       the requested information, in bytes. Otherwise, the where argument must
       point to an unsigned 32-bit integer (uint32_t variable), except for the
       following what values, when it must point to a  variable  of  the  type
       shown:

         PCRE2_INFO_FIRSTBITMAP     const uint8_t *
         PCRE2_INFO_JITSIZE         size_t
         PCRE2_INFO_NAMETABLE       PCRE2_SPTR
         PCRE2_INFO_SIZE            size_t

       The yield of the function is zero on success or:

         PCRE2_ERROR_NULL           the argument code is NULL
         PCRE2_ERROR_BADMAGIC       the "magic number" was not found
         PCRE2_ERROR_BADOPTION      the value of what is invalid
         PCRE2_ERROR_BADMODE        the pattern was compiled in the wrong mode
         PCRE2_ERROR_UNSET          the requested information is not set
