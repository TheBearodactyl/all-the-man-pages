NAME
       CURLINFO_SPEED_DOWNLOAD - get download speed

SYNOPSIS
       #include <curl/curl.h>

       CURLcode curl_easy_getinfo(CURL *handle, CURLINFO_SPEED_DOWNLOAD,
                                  double *speed);

DESCRIPTION
       Pass a pointer to a double to receive the average download speed that curl measured for the complete download. Measured in bytes/second.

       CURLINFO_SPEED_DOWNLOAD_T(3) is a newer replacement that returns a more sensible variable type.
