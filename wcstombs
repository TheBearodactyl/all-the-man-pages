NAME
       wcstombs - convert a wide-character string to a multibyte string

LIBRARY
       Standard C library (libc, -lc)

SYNOPSIS
       #include <stdlib.h>

       size_t wcstombs(char dest[restrict .n], const wchar_t *restrict src,
                       size_t n);

DESCRIPTION
       If  dest  is  not  NULL,  the  wcstombs() function converts the wide-character string src to a multibyte string starting at dest.  At most n bytes are written to dest.  The sequence of characters
       placed in dest begins in the initial shift state.  The conversion can stop for three reasons:

       •  A wide character has been encountered that can not be represented as a multibyte sequence (according to the current locale).  In this case, (size_t) -1 is returned.

       •  The length limit forces a stop.  In this case, the number of bytes written to dest is returned, but the shift state at this point is lost.

       •  The wide-character string has been completely converted, including the terminating null wide character (L'\0').  In this case, the conversion ends in the initial shift state.   The  number  of
          bytes written to dest, excluding the terminating null byte ('\0'), is returned.

       The programmer must ensure that there is room for at least n bytes at dest.

       If dest is NULL, n is ignored, and the conversion proceeds as above, except that the converted bytes are not written out to memory, and no length limit exists.

       In order to avoid the case 2 above, the programmer should make sure n is greater than or equal to wcstombs(NULL,src,0)+1.

RETURN VALUE
       The  wcstombs()  function  returns the number of bytes that make up the converted part of a multibyte sequence, not including the terminating null byte.  If a wide character was encountered which
       could not be converted, (size_t) -1 is returned.

VERSIONS
       The function wcsrtombs(3) provides a better interface to the same functionality.

STANDARDS
       C11, POSIX.1-2008.

HISTORY
       POSIX.1-2001, C99.

NOTES
       The behavior of wcstombs() depends on the LC_CTYPE category of the current locale.

PROLOG

       the interface may not be implemented on Linux.

NAME
       wcstombs — convert a wide-character string to a character string

SYNOPSIS
       #include <stdlib.h>

       size_t wcstombs(char *restrict s, const wchar_t *restrict pwcs,
           size_t n);

DESCRIPTION
       The functionality described on this reference page is aligned with the ISO C standard. Any conflict between the requirements described here and the ISO C standard is unintentional. This volume of
       POSIX.1‐2017 defers to the ISO C standard.

       The  wcstombs() function shall convert the sequence of wide-character codes that are in the array pointed to by pwcs into a sequence of characters that begins in the initial shift state and store
       these characters into the array pointed to by s, stopping if a character would exceed the limit of n total bytes or if a null byte is stored. Each wide-character code shall be converted as if  by
       a call to wctomb(), except that the shift state of wctomb() shall not be affected.

       The behavior of this function shall be affected by the LC_CTYPE category of the current locale.

       No more than n bytes shall be modified in the array pointed to by s.  If copying takes place between objects that overlap, the behavior is undefined.  If s is a null pointer, wcstombs() shall re‐
       turn the length required to convert the entire array regardless of the value of n, but no values are stored.

RETURN VALUE
       If a wide-character code is encountered that does not correspond to a valid character (of one or more bytes each), wcstombs() shall return (size_t)-1. Otherwise, wcstombs() shall return the  num‐
       ber of bytes stored in the character array, not including any terminating null byte. The array shall not be null-terminated if the value returned is n.

ERRORS
       The wcstombs() function shall fail if:

       EILSEQ A wide-character code does not correspond to a valid character.

       The following sections are informative.

       None.
