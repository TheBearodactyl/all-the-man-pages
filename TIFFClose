NAME
       TIFFClose - close a previously opened TIFF file

SYNOPSIS
          #include <tiffio.h>

       void TIFFClose(TIFF *tif)

       void TIFFCleanup(TIFF *tif)

DESCRIPTION
       TIFFClose()  closes a file that was previously opened with TIFFOpen().  Any buffered data are flushed to the file, including the contents of the current directory (if modified); and all resources
       are reclaimed. TIFFClose() calls TIFFCleanup() and then the associated function to close the file handle.

       TIFFCleanup() is an auxiliary function to free the TIFF structure.  The given structure will be completely freed, so you should save opened file handle and pointer to the close procedure  in  ex‚Äê
       ternal variables before calling TIFFCleanup(), if you will need these ones to close the file.

DIAGNOSTICS
       All error messages are directed to the TIFFErrorExtR() routine.  Likewise, warning messages are directed to the TIFFWarningExtR() routine.
