NAME
       curl_free - reclaim memory that has been obtained through a libcurl call

SYNOPSIS
       #include <curl/curl.h>

       void curl_free(void *ptr);

DESCRIPTION
       curl_free  reclaims  memory that has been obtained through a libcurl call. Use curl_free(3) instead of free() to avoid anomalies that can result from differences in memory management between your
       application and libcurl.

       Passing in a NULL pointer in ptr will make this function return immediately with no action.

EXAMPLE
         char *width = curl_getenv("COLUMNS");
         if(width) {
           /* it was set! */
           curl_free(width);
         }

AVAILABILITY
       Always

RETURN VALUE
       None
