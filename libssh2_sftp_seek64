NAME
       libssh2_sftp_seek64 - set the read/write position within a file

SYNOPSIS
       #include <libssh2.h>
       #include <libssh2_sftp.h>

       void libssh2_sftp_seek64(LIBSSH2_SFTP_HANDLE *handle,
                                libssh2_uint64_t offset);

DESCRIPTION
       handle - SFTP File Handle as returned by libssh2_sftp_open_ex(3)

       offset - Number of bytes from the beginning of file to seek to.

       Move the file handle's internal pointer to an arbitrary location. libssh2 implements file pointers as a localized concept to make file access appear more POSIX like. No packets are exchanged with
       the server during a seek operation. The localized file pointer is simply used as a convenience offset during read/write operations.

       You MUST NOT seek during writing or reading a file with SFTP, as the internals use outstanding packets and changing the "file position" during transit will results in badness.

AVAILABILITY
