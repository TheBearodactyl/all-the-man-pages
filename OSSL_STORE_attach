OSSL_STORE_ATTACH(3ssl)             OpenSSL            OSSL_STORE_ATTACH(3ssl)

NAME
       OSSL_STORE_attach - Functions to read objects from a BIO

SYNOPSIS
        #include <openssl/store.h>

        OSSL_STORE_CTX *OSSL_STORE_attach(BIO *bio, const char *scheme,
                                          OSSL_LIB_CTX *libctx, const char *propq,
                                          const UI_METHOD *ui_method, void *ui_data,
                                          const OSSL_PARAM params[],
                                          OSSL_STORE_post_process_info_fn post_process,
                                          void *post_process_data);

DESCRIPTION
       OSSL_STORE_attach() works like OSSL_STORE_open(3), except it takes a
       BIO bio instead of a uri, along with a scheme to determine what loader
       should be used to process the data. The reference count of the BIO
       object is increased by 1 if the call is successful.

RETURN VALUES
       OSSL_STORE_attach() returns a pointer to a OSSL_STORE_CTX on success,
       or NULL on failure.

HISTORY
       OSSL_STORE_attach() was added in OpenSSL 3.0.
