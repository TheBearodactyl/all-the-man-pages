NAME
       io_uring_buf_ring_advance - advance index of provided buffer in buffer ring

SYNOPSIS
       #include <liburing.h>

       void io_uring_buf_ring_advance(struct io_uring_buf_ring *br,
                                      int count);

DESCRIPTION
       The  io_uring_buf_ring_advance(3)  commits count previously added buffers to the shared buffer ring br, making them visible to the kernel and hence consumable. This passes ownership of the buffer
       to the ring.

RETURN VALUE
       None
