NAME
       XtCreateApplicationContext, XtDestroyApplicationContext, XtWidgetToApplicationContext, XtToolkitInitialize - create, destroy, and obtain an application context

SYNTAX
       #include <X11/Intrinsic.h>

       XtAppContext XtCreateApplicationContext(void);

       void XtDestroyApplicationContext(XtAppContext app_context);

       XtAppContext XtWidgetToApplicationContext(Widget w);

       void XtToolkitInitialize(void);

ARGUMENTS
       app_context
                 Specifies the application context.

       w         Specifies the widget that you want the application context for.

DESCRIPTION
       The XtCreateApplicationContext function returns an application context, which is an opaque type.  Every application must have at least one application context.

       The XtDestroyApplicationContext function destroys the specified application context as soon as it is safe to do so.  If called from with an event dispatch (for example, a callback procedure),
       XtDestroyApplicationContext does not destroy the application context until the dispatch is complete.

       The XtWidgetToApplicationContext function returns the application context for the specified widget.

       The XtToolkitInitialize function initializes the Intrinsics internals.  If XtToolkitInitialize was previously called it returns immediately.
