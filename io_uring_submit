NAME
       io_uring_submit - submit requests to the submission queue

SYNOPSIS
       #include <liburing.h>

       int io_uring_submit(struct io_uring *ring);

DESCRIPTION
       The io_uring_submit(3) function submits the next events to the submission queue belonging to the ring.

       After the caller retrieves a submission queue entry (SQE) with io_uring_get_sqe(3) and prepares the SQE using one of the provided helpers, it can be submitted with io_uring_submit(3).

RETURN VALUE
       On success io_uring_submit(3) returns the number of submitted submission queue entries. On failure it returns -errno.

NOTES
       For  any request that passes in data in a struct, that data must remain valid until the request has been successfully submitted. It need not remain valid until completion. Once a request has been
       submitted, the in-kernel state is stable. Very early kernels (5.4 and earlier) required state to be stable until the completion occurred. Applications can test for this behavior by inspecting the
       IORING_FEAT_SUBMIT_STABLE  flag  passed  back  from io_uring_queue_init_params(3).  In general, the man pages for the individual prep helpers will have a note mentioning this fact as well, if re‚Äê
       quired for the given command.
