ERR_NEW(3ssl)                                                                                     OpenSSL                                                                                    ERR_NEW(3ssl)

NAME
       ERR_new, ERR_set_debug, ERR_set_error, ERR_vset_error - Error recording building blocks

SYNOPSIS
        #include <openssl/err.h>

        void ERR_new(void);
        void ERR_set_debug(const char *file, int line, const char *func);
        void ERR_set_error(int lib, int reason, const char *fmt, ...);
        void ERR_vset_error(int lib, int reason, const char *fmt, va_list args);

DESCRIPTION
       The functions described here are generally not used directly, but rather through macros such as ERR_raise(3).  They can still be useful for anyone that wants to make their own macros.

       ERR_new() allocates a new slot in the thread's error queue.

       ERR_set_debug() sets the debug information related to the current error in the thread's error queue.  The values that can be given are the filename file, line in the file line and the name of the
       function func where the error occurred.  The names must be constant, this function will only save away the pointers, not copy the strings.

       ERR_set_error() sets the error information, which are the library number lib and the reason code reason, and additional data as a format string fmt and an arbitrary number of arguments.  The
       additional data is processed with BIO_snprintf(3) to form the additional data string, which is allocated and store in the error record.

       ERR_vset_error() works like ERR_set_error(), but takes a va_list argument instead of a variable number of arguments.

RETURN VALUES
       ERR_new, ERR_set_debug, ERR_set_error and ERR_vset_error do not return any values.

NOTES
       The library number is unique to each unit that records errors.  OpenSSL has a number of preallocated ones for its own uses, but others may allocate their own library number dynamically with
       ERR_get_next_error_library(3).

       Reason codes are unique within each library, and may have an associated set of strings as a short description of the reason.  For dynamically allocated library numbers, reason strings are
       recorded with ERR_load_strings(3).

       Provider authors are supplied with core versions of these functions, see provider-base(7).
