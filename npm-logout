NAME
       npm-logout - Log out of the registry

   Synopsis
         npm logout

       Note: This command is unaware of workspaces.

   Description
       When logged into a registry that supports token-based authentication, tell the server to end this token's session. This will invalidate the token everywhere you're using it, not just for the cur‐
       rent environment.

       When logged into a legacy registry that uses username and password authentication, this will clear the credentials in your user configuration.  In this case, it will only affect the current envi‐
       ronment.

       If --scope is provided, this will find the credentials for the registry connected to that scope, if set.

   Configuration
   registry
       • Default: "https://registry.npmjs.org/"

       • Type: URL

       The base URL of the npm registry.

   scope
       • Default: the scope of the current project, if any, or ""

       • Type: String

       Associate an operation with a scope for a scoped registry.

       Useful when logging in to or out of a private registry:

         # log in, linking the scope to the custom registry
         npm login --scope=@mycorp --registry=https://registry.mycorp.com

         # log out, removing the link and the auth token
         npm logout --scope=@mycorp

       This will cause @mycorp to be mapped to the registry for future installation of packages specified according to the pattern @mycorp/package.

       This will also cause npm init to create a scoped package.

         # accept all defaults, and create a package named "@foo/whatever",
         # instead of just named "whatever"
         npm init --scope=@foo --yes
