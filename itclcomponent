NAME
       itcl::component - define components for extendedclass, widget or widgetadaptor

       Parts of this description are "borrowed" from Tcl extension [snit], as the functionality is mostly identical.

WARNING!
       This is new functionality in [incr Tcl] where the API can still change!!

SYNOPSIS
       public component comp ?-inherit?
       protected component comp ?-inherit?
       private component comp ?-inherit?

DESCRIPTION
       The component command is used inside an [incr Tcl] extendedclass/widget/widgetadaptor definition to define components.

       Explicitly declares a component called comp, and automatically defines the component's instance variable.

       If  the  -inherit  option is specified then all unknown methods and options will be delegated to this component. The name -inherit implies that instances of this new type inherit, in a sense, the
       methods and options of the component. That is, -inherit yes is equivalent to:

              component mycomp
              delegate option * to mycomp
              delegate method * to mycomp
