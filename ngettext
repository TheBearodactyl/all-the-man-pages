NAME
       ngettext - translate message and choose plural form

SYNOPSIS
       ngettext [OPTION] [TEXTDOMAIN] MSGID MSGID-PLURAL COUNT

DESCRIPTION
       The  ngettext program translates a natural language message into the user's language, by looking up the translation in a message catalog, and chooses the appropriate plural form, which depends on
       the number COUNT and the language of the message catalog where the translation was found.

       Display native language translation of a textual message whose grammatical form depends on a number.

       -d, --domain=TEXTDOMAIN
              retrieve translated message from TEXTDOMAIN

       -c, --context=CONTEXT
              specify context for MSGID

       -e     enable expansion of some escape sequences

       -E     (ignored for compatibility)

       [TEXTDOMAIN]
              retrieve translated message from TEXTDOMAIN

       MSGID MSGID-PLURAL
              translate MSGID (singular) / MSGID-PLURAL (plural)

       COUNT  choose singular/plural form based on this value

   Informative output:
       -h, --help
              display this help and exit

       -V, --version
              display version information and exit

       If the TEXTDOMAIN parameter is not given, the domain is determined from the environment variable TEXTDOMAIN.  If the message catalog is not found in the regular directory, another location can be
       specified with the environment variable TEXTDOMAINDIR.  Standard search directory: /usr/share/locale

NAME
       ngettext, dngettext, dcngettext - translate message and choose plural form

SYNOPSIS
       #include <libintl.h>

       char * ngettext (const char * msgid, const char * msgid_plural,
                        unsigned long int n);
       char * dngettext (const char * domainname,
                         const char * msgid, const char * msgid_plural,
                         unsigned long int n);
       char * dcngettext (const char * domainname,
                          const char * msgid, const char * msgid_plural,
                          unsigned long int n, int category);

DESCRIPTION
       The ngettext, dngettext and dcngettext functions attempt to translate a text string into the user's native language, by looking up the appropriate plural form of the translation in a message cat‐
       alog.

       Plural forms are grammatical variants depending on the a number. Some languages have two forms, called singular and plural. Other languages have three forms, called  singular,  dual  and  plural.
       There are also languages with four forms.

       The  ngettext,  dngettext  and dcngettext functions work like the gettext, dgettext and dcgettext functions, respectively.  Additionally, they choose the appropriate plural form, which depends on
       the number n and the language of the message catalog where the translation was found.

       In the "C" locale, or if none of the used catalogs contain a translation for msgid, the ngettext, dngettext and dcngettext functions return msgid if n == 1, or msgid_plural if n != 1.

RETURN VALUE
       If a translation was found in one of the specified catalogs, the appropriate plural form is converted to the locale's codeset and returned. The resulting string is statically allocated  and  must
       not be modified or freed. Otherwise msgid or msgid_plural is returned, as described above.

ERRORS
       errno is not modified.

BUGS
       The return type ought to be const char *, but is char * to avoid warnings in C code predating ANSI C.
