NAME
       xcb_create_gc - Creates a graphics context

SYNOPSIS
       #include <xcb/xproto.h>

   Request function
       xcb_void_cookie_t xcb_create_gc(xcb_connection_t *conn, xcb_gcontext_t cid, xcb_drawable_t drawable, uint32_t value_mask, const void *value_list);

REQUEST ARGUMENTS
       conn      The XCB connection to X11.

       cid       The ID with which you will refer to the graphics context, created by xcb_generate_id.

       drawable  Drawable to get the root/depth from.

       value_mask
                 TODO: NOT YET DOCUMENTED.

       value_list
                 TODO: NOT YET DOCUMENTED.

DESCRIPTION
       Creates a graphics context. The graphics context can be used with any drawable that has the same root and depth as the specified drawable.

RETURN VALUE
       Returns an xcb_void_cookie_t. Errors (if any) have to be handled in the event loop.

       If you want to handle errors directly with xcb_request_check instead, use xcb_create_gc_checked. See xcb-requests(3) for details.

ERRORS
       xcb_alloc_error_t
                 The X server could not allocate the requested resources (no memory?).

       xcb_drawable_error_t
                 The specified drawable (Window or Pixmap) does not exist.

       xcb_font_error_t
                 TODO: reasons?

       xcb_match_error_t
                 TODO: reasons?

       xcb_pixmap_error_t
