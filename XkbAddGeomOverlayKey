NAME
       XkbAddGeomOverlayKey - Add a key to an existing overlay row

SYNOPSIS
       XkbOverlayKeyPtr XkbAddGeomOverlayKey (XkbOverlayPtr overlay, XkbRowPtr row, _Xconst char *over, _Xconst char *under);

ARGUMENTS
       overlay
              overlay to be updated

       row    row in overlay to be updated

       under  primary name of the key to be considered

DESCRIPTION
       Xkb  provides  functions  to add a single new element to the top-level keyboard geometry. In each case the num_ * fields of the corresponding structure is incremented by 1. These functions do not
       change sz_* unless there is no more room in the array. Some of these functions fill in the values of the element's structure from the arguments. For other functions,  you  must  explicitly  write
       code to fill the structure's elements.

       The top-level geometry description includes a list of geometry properties.  A geometry property associates an arbitrary string with an equally arbitrary name. Programs that display images of key‚Äê
       boards can use geometry properties as hints, but they are not interpreted by Xkb. No other geometry structures refer to geometry properties.

       XkbAddGeomOverlayKey adds one key to the row in the overlay.  If there is no key named under in the row of the underlying section, XkbAddGeomOverlayKey returns NULL.

STRUCTURES
           typedef struct _XkbOverlayKey {
               XkbKeyNameRec           over;      /* name of this overlay key */
               XkbKeyNameRec           under;     /* name of the key under this overlay key */
           } XkbOverlayKeyRec,*XkbOverlayKeyPtr;
