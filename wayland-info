       wayland-info

DESCRIPTION
       wayland-info is a utility for displaying information about the Wayland protocols supported by a Wayland compositor.

       It can be used to check which Wayland protocols and versions are advertised by the Wayland compositor.

       wayland-info also provides additional information for a subset of Wayland protocols it knows about, namely Linux DMABUF, presentation time, tablet and XDG output protocols.

OPTIONS
       wayland-info does not accept any command line option.

ENVIRONMENT
       WAYLAND_DISPLAY
              The name of the display (socket) of an already running Wayland server, without the path. The directory path is always taken from XDG_RUNTIME_DIR.  If WAYLAND_DISPLAY is not set, the socket
              name is "wayland-0".
