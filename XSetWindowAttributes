NAME
       XCreateWindow, XCreateSimpleWindow, XSetWindowAttributes - create windows and window attributes structure

SYNTAX
       Window  XCreateWindow(Display  *display,  Window  parent, int x, int y, unsigned int width, unsigned int height, unsigned int border_width, int depth, unsigned int class, Visual *visual, unsigned
              long valuemask, XSetWindowAttributes *attributes);

       Window XCreateSimpleWindow(Display *display, Window parent, int x, int y, unsigned int width, unsigned int height, unsigned int border_width, unsigned long border, unsigned long background);

ARGUMENTS
       attributes
                 Specifies the structure from which the values (as specified by the value mask) are to be taken.  The value mask should have the appropriate bits set to indicate  which  attributes  have
                 been set in the structure.

       background
                 Specifies the background pixel value of the window.

       border    Specifies the border pixel value of the window.

       border_width
                 Specifies the width of the created window's border in pixels.

       class     Specifies the created window's class.  You can pass InputOutput, InputOnly, or CopyFromParent.  A class of CopyFromParent means the class is taken from the parent.

       depth     Specifies the window's depth.  A depth of CopyFromParent means the depth is taken from the parent.

       display   Specifies the connection to the X server.

       parent    Specifies the parent window.

       valuemask Specifies  which window attributes are defined in the attributes argument.  This mask is the bitwise inclusive OR of the valid attribute mask bits.  If valuemask is zero, the attributes
                 are ignored and are not referenced.

       visual    Specifies the visual type.  A visual of CopyFromParent means the visual type is taken from the parent.

       width
       height    Specify the width and height, which are the created window's inside dimensions and do not include the created window's borders.

       x
       y         Specify the x and y coordinates, which are the top-left outside corner of the window's borders and are relative to the inside of the parent window's borders.

DESCRIPTION
       The XCreateWindow function creates an unmapped subwindow for a specified parent window, returns the window ID of the created window, and causes the X server to generate a CreateNotify event.  The
       created window is placed on top in the stacking order with respect to siblings.

       The  coordinate  system  has  the X axis horizontal and the Y axis vertical with the origin [0, 0] at the upper-left corner.  Coordinates are integral, in terms of pixels, and coincide with pixel
       centers.  Each window and pixmap has its own coordinate system.  For a window, the origin is inside the border at the inside, upper-left corner.

       The border_width for an InputOnly window must be zero, or a BadMatch error results.  For class InputOutput, the visual type and depth must be a combination supported for the screen, or a BadMatch
       error  results.   The  depth  need  not be the same as the parent, but the parent must not be a window of class InputOnly, or a BadMatch error results.  For an InputOnly window, the depth must be
       zero, and the visual must be one supported by the screen.  If either condition is not met, a BadMatch error results.  The parent window, however, may have any depth and class.  If you specify any
       invalid window attribute for a window, a BadMatch error results.

       The created window is not yet displayed (mapped) on the user's display.  To display the window, call XMapWindow.  The new window initially uses the same cursor as its parent.  A new cursor can be
       defined for the new window by calling XDefineCursor.  The window will not be visible on the screen unless it and all of its ancestors are mapped and it is not obscured by any of its ancestors.

       XCreateWindow can generate BadAlloc BadColor, BadCursor, BadMatch, BadPixmap, BadValue, and BadWindow errors.

       The XCreateSimpleWindow function creates an unmapped InputOutput subwindow for a specified parent window, returns the window ID of the created window, and causes the X server to generate a Creat‐
       eNotify  event.   The  created window is placed on top in the stacking order with respect to siblings.  Any part of the window that extends outside its parent window is clipped.  The border_width
       for an InputOnly window must be zero, or a BadMatch error results.  XCreateSimpleWindow inherits its depth, class, and visual from its parent.  All other window attributes, except background  and
       border, have their default values.

       XCreateSimpleWindow can generate BadAlloc, BadMatch, BadValue, and BadWindow errors.

DIAGNOSTICS
       BadAlloc  The server failed to allocate the requested resource or server memory.

       BadColor  A value for a Colormap argument does not name a defined Colormap.

       BadCursor A value for a Cursor argument does not name a defined Cursor.

       BadMatch  The values do not exist for an InputOnly window.

       BadMatch  Some argument or pair of arguments has the correct type and range but fails to match in some other way required by the request.

       BadPixmap A value for a Pixmap argument does not name a defined Pixmap.

       BadValue  Some numeric value falls outside the range of values accepted by the request.  Unless a specific range is specified for an argument, the full range defined by the argument's type is ac‐
                 cepted.  Any argument defined as a set of alternatives can generate this error.

       BadWindow A value for a Window argument does not name a defined Window.
