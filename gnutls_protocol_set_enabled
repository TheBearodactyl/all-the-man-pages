NAME
       gnutls_protocol_set_enabled - API function

SYNOPSIS
       #include <gnutls/gnutls.h>

       int gnutls_protocol_set_enabled(gnutls_protocol_t version, unsigned int enabled);

ARGUMENTS
       gnutls_protocol_t version
                   is a (gnutls) version number

       unsigned int enabled
                   whether to enable the protocol

DESCRIPTION
       Control the previous system-wide setting that marked  version as enabled or disabled.  Calling this function is allowed only if allowlisting mode is set in the configuration file, and only if the
       system-wide TLS priority string has not been initialized yet.  The intended usage is to provide applications with a way to expressly deviate from the distribution or site defaults inherited  from
       the configuration file.  The modification is composable with further modifications performed through the priority string mechanism.

       This function is not thread-safe and is intended to be called in the main thread at the beginning of the process execution.

RETURNS
       0 on success or negative error code otherwise.

SINCE
       3.7.3
