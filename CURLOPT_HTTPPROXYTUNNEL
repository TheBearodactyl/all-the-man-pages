NAME
       CURLOPT_HTTPPROXYTUNNEL - tunnel through HTTP proxy

SYNOPSIS
       #include <curl/curl.h>

       CURLcode curl_easy_setopt(CURL *handle, CURLOPT_HTTPPROXYTUNNEL, long tunnel);

DESCRIPTION
       Set the tunnel parameter to 1L to make libcurl tunnel all operations through the HTTP proxy (set with CURLOPT_PROXY(3)). There is a big difference between using a proxy and to tunnel through it.

       Tunneling  means  that an HTTP CONNECT request is sent to the proxy, asking it to connect to a remote host on a specific port number and then the traffic is just passed through the proxy. Proxies
       tend to white-list specific port numbers it allows CONNECT requests to and often only port 80 and 443 are allowed.

       To suppress proxy CONNECT response headers from user callbacks use CURLOPT_SUPPRESS_CONNECT_HEADERS(3).

       HTTP proxies can generally only speak HTTP (for obvious reasons), which makes libcurl convert non-HTTP requests to HTTP when using an HTTP proxy without this tunnel option set. For example,  ask‚Äê
       ing  for  an  FTP  URL  and specifying an HTTP proxy will make libcurl send an FTP URL in an HTTP GET request to the proxy. By instead tunneling through the proxy, you avoid that conversion (that
       rarely works through the proxy anyway).

         curl_easy_setopt(curl, CURLOPT_PROXY, "http://127.0.0.1:80");
         curl_easy_setopt(curl, CURLOPT_HTTPPROXYTUNNEL, 1L);
