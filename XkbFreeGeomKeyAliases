NAME
       XkbFreeGeomKeyAliases - Free geometry key aliases

SYNOPSIS
       void XkbFreeGeomKeyAliases (XkbGeometryPtr geom, int first, int count, Bool free_all);

ARGUMENTS
       geom   geometry in which key aliases should be freed

       first  first key alias to be freed

       count  number of key aliases to be freed

       free_all
              True => all key aliases are freed

DESCRIPTION
       Xkb  provides a number of functions to allocate and free subcomponents of a keyboard geometry. Use these functions to create or modify keyboard geometries.  Note that these functions merely allo‚Äê
       cate space for the new element(s), and it is up to you to fill in the values explicitly in your code. These allocation functions increase sz_* but never touch num_* (unless there is an allocation
       failure,  in which case they reset both sz_* and num_* to zero). These functions return Success if they succeed, BadAlloc if they are not able to allocate space, or BadValue if a parameter is not
       as expected.

       If free_all is True, all aliases in the top level of the specified geometry geom are freed regardless of the value of first or count.  Otherwise, count aliases in geom are  freed  beginning  with
       the one specified by first.

RETURN VALUES
       Success        The XkbFreeGeomKeyAliases function returns Success if there are no allocation errors.

DIAGNOSTICS
       BadAlloc       Unable to allocate storage

       BadValue       An argument is out of range
