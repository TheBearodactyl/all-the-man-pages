SCHED_GETPARAM(3P)         POSIX Programmer's Manual        SCHED_GETPARAM(3P)

PROLOG
       This  manual  page is part of the POSIX Programmer's Manual.  The Linux
       implementation of this interface may differ (consult the  corresponding
       Linux  manual page for details of Linux behavior), or the interface may
       not be implemented on Linux.

NAME
       sched_getparam — get scheduling parameters (REALTIME)

SYNOPSIS
       #include <sched.h>

       int sched_getparam(pid_t pid, struct sched_param *param);

DESCRIPTION
       The sched_getparam() function shall return the scheduling parameters of
       a  process  specified by pid in the sched_param structure pointed to by
       param.

       If a process specified by pid exists, and if the  calling  process  has
       permission,  the scheduling parameters for the process whose process ID
       is equal to pid shall be returned.

       If pid is zero, the scheduling parameters for the calling process shall
       be  returned. The behavior of the sched_getparam() function is unspeci‐
       fied if the value of pid is negative.

RETURN VALUE
       Upon successful completion, the sched_getparam() function shall  return
       zero.  If  the  call  to sched_getparam() is unsuccessful, the function
       shall return a value of -1 and set errno to indicate the error.

ERRORS
       The sched_getparam() function shall fail if:

       EPERM  The requesting process does not have permission  to  obtain  the
              scheduling parameters of the specified process.

       ESRCH  No process can be found corresponding to that specified by pid.

NAME
       sched_setparam, sched_getparam - set and get scheduling parameters

LIBRARY
       Standard C library (libc, -lc)

SYNOPSIS
       #include <sched.h>

       int sched_setparam(pid_t pid, const struct sched_param *param);
       int sched_getparam(pid_t pid, struct sched_param *param);

       struct sched_param {
           ...
           int sched_priority;
           ...
       };

DESCRIPTION
       sched_setparam()  sets  the  scheduling  parameters associated with the
       scheduling policy for the thread whose thread ID is specified  in  pid.
       If pid is zero, then the parameters of the calling thread are set.  The
       interpretation of the argument param depends on the  scheduling  policy
       of the thread identified by pid.  See sched(7) for a description of the
       scheduling policies supported under Linux.

       sched_getparam() retrieves the scheduling  parameters  for  the  thread
       identified  by pid.  If pid is zero, then the parameters of the calling
       thread are retrieved.

       sched_setparam() checks the validity of param for the scheduling policy
       of  the  thread.   The  value param->sched_priority must lie within the
       range given by sched_get_priority_min(2) and sched_get_priority_max(2).

       For a discussion of the  privileges  and  resource  limits  related  to
       scheduling priority and policy, see sched(7).

       POSIX systems on which sched_setparam() and sched_getparam() are avail‐
       able define _POSIX_PRIORITY_SCHEDULING in <unistd.h>.

RETURN VALUE
       On success, sched_setparam() and sched_getparam() return 0.  On  error,
       -1 is returned, and errno is set to indicate the error.

ERRORS
       EINVAL Invalid arguments: param is NULL or pid is negative

       EINVAL (sched_setparam())  The  argument  param does not make sense for
              the current scheduling policy.

       EPERM  (sched_setparam()) The caller does not have  appropriate  privi‐
              leges (Linux: does not have the CAP_SYS_NICE capability).

       ESRCH  The thread whose ID is pid could not be found.
