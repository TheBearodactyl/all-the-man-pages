PROLOG
       This  manual  page is part of the POSIX Programmer's Manual.  The Linux
       implementation of this interface may differ (consult the  corresponding
       Linux  manual page for details of Linux behavior), or the interface may
       not be implemented on Linux.

NAME
       posix_spawn_file_actions_destroy, posix_spawn_file_actions_init  —  de‐
       stroy and initialize spawn file actions object (ADVANCED REALTIME)

SYNOPSIS
       #include <spawn.h>

       int posix_spawn_file_actions_destroy(posix_spawn_file_actions_t
           *file_actions);
       int posix_spawn_file_actions_init(posix_spawn_file_actions_t
           *file_actions);

DESCRIPTION
       The  posix_spawn_file_actions_destroy()  function shall destroy the ob‐
       ject referenced by file_actions; the object becomes, in effect,  unini‐
       tialized.  An  implementation  may  cause  posix_spawn_file_actions_de‐
       stroy() to set the object referenced  by  file_actions  to  an  invalid
       value. A destroyed spawn file actions object can be reinitialized using
       posix_spawn_file_actions_init(); the results of  otherwise  referencing
       the object after it has been destroyed are undefined.

       The  posix_spawn_file_actions_init()  function shall initialize the ob‐
       ject  referenced  by  file_actions  to  contain  no  file  actions  for
       posix_spawn() or posix_spawnp() to perform.

       A  spawn  file  actions  object  is  as defined in posix_spawn_file_ac‐
       tions_addclose().

       The effect of initializing an already initialized  spawn  file  actions
       object is undefined.

RETURN VALUE
       Upon  successful  completion, these functions shall return zero; other‐
       wise, an error number shall be returned to indicate the error.

ERRORS
       The posix_spawn_file_actions_init() function shall fail if:

       ENOMEM Insufficient memory exists to initialize the spawn file  actions
              object.

       The posix_spawn_file_actions_destroy() function may fail if:

       EINVAL The value specified by file_actions is invalid.

EXAMPLES
       None.

APPLICATION USAGE
       These  functions  are part of the Spawn option and need not be provided
       on all implementations.

RATIONALE
       Refer to the RATIONALE section in posix_spawn_file_actions_addclose().

FUTURE DIRECTIONS
       None.
