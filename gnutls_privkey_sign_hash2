NAME
       gnutls_privkey_sign_hash2 - API function

SYNOPSIS
       #include <gnutls/abstract.h>

       int gnutls_privkey_sign_hash2(gnutls_privkey_t signer, gnutls_sign_algorithm_t algo, unsigned int flags, const gnutls_datum_t * hash_data, gnutls_datum_t * signature);

ARGUMENTS
       gnutls_privkey_t signer
                   Holds the signer's key

       gnutls_sign_algorithm_t algo
                   The signature algorithm used

       unsigned int flags
                   Zero or one of gnutls_privkey_flags_t

       const gnutls_datum_t * hash_data
                   holds the data to be signed

       gnutls_datum_t * signature
                   will contain newly allocated signature

DESCRIPTION
       This  function  will sign the given hashed data using the specified signature algorithm. This function is an enhancement of gnutls_privkey_sign_hash(), as it allows utilizing a alternative signa‐
       ture algorithm where possible (e.g, use an RSA key with RSA-PSS).

       The flags may be GNUTLS_PRIVKEY_SIGN_FLAG_TLS1_RSA.  In that case this function will ignore  hash_algo and perform a raw PKCS1 signature.  Note that this flag is supported since 3.6.9.

       Note also that, not all algorithm support signing already hashed data. When signing with Ed25519, gnutls_privkey_sign_data2() should be used instead.

RETURNS
       On success, GNUTLS_E_SUCCESS (0) is returned, otherwise a negative error value.

SINCE
       3.6.0
