NAME
       XtSetWMColormapWindows - Set the value of the WM_COLORMAP_WINDOWS property

SYNTAX
       #include <X11/Intrinsic.h>

       void XtSetWMColormapWindows(Widget widget, Widget* list, Cardinal count);

ARGUMENTS
       widget    Specifies the widget on whose window the WM_COLORMAP_WINDOWS property will be stored.  Must be of class Core or any subclass thereof.

       list      Specifies a list of widgets whose windows are are potentially to be listed in the WM_COLORMAP_WINDOWS property.

       count     Specifies the number of widgets in list.

DESCRIPTION
       XtSetWMColormapWindows returns immediately if widget is not realized or if count is zero.  Otherwise, XtSetWMColormapWindows constructs an ordered list of windows by examining each widget in list
       in turn and ignoring the widget if it is not realized, or adding the widget's window to the window list if the widget is realized and its colormap resource is different from the colormap re‚Äê
       sources of all widgets whose windows are already on the window list.

       Finally, XtSetWMColormapWindows stores the resulting window list in the WM_COLORMAP_WINDOWS property on the specified widget's window.
