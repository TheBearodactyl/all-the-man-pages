NAME
       XtMapWidget, XtSetMappedWhenManaged, XtUnmapWidget - map and unmap widgets

SYNTAX
       #include <X11/Intrinsic.h>

       void XtMapWidget(Widget w);

       void XtSetMappedWhenManaged(Widget w, Boolean map_when_managed);

       void XtUnmapWidget(Widget w);

ARGUMENTS
       map_when_managed
                 Specifies a Boolean value that indicates the new value of the map_when_managed field.

       w         Specifies the widget.

DESCRIPTION
       If the widget is realized and managed and if the new value of map_when_managed is True, XtSetMappedWhenManaged maps the window.  If the widget is realized and managed and if the new value of
       map_when_managed is False, it unmaps the window.  XtSetMappedWhenManaged is a convenience function that is equivalent to (but slightly faster than) calling XtSetValues and setting the new value
       for the mappedWhenManaged resource.  As an alternative to using XtSetMappedWhenManaged to control mapping, a client may set mapped_when_managed to False and use XtMapWidget and XtUnmapWidget ex‚Äê
       plicitly.
