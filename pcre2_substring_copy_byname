NAME
       PCRE2 - Perl-compatible regular expressions (revised API)

SYNOPSIS

       #include <pcre2.h>

       int pcre2_substring_copy_byname(pcre2_match_data *match_data,
         PCRE2_SPTR name, PCRE2_UCHAR *buffer, PCRE2_SIZE *bufflen);

DESCRIPTION

       This  is  a  convenience  function for extracting a captured substring,
       identified by name, into a given buffer. The arguments are:

         match_data    The match data block for the match
         name          Name of the required substring
         buffer        Buffer to receive the string
         bufflen       Length of buffer (code units)

       The bufflen variable is updated to contain the length of the  extracted
       string,  excluding the trailing zero. The yield of the function is zero
       for success or one of the following error numbers:

         PCRE2_ERROR_NOSUBSTRING   there are no groups of that name
         PCRE2_ERROR_UNAVAILBLE    the ovector was too small for that group
         PCRE2_ERROR_UNSET         the group did not participate in the match
         PCRE2_ERROR_NOMEMORY      the buffer is not big enough

       If there is more than one group with the given name, the first one that
       is  set  is returned. In this situation PCRE2_ERROR_UNSET means that no
       group with the given name was set.

       There is a complete description of the PCRE2 native API in the pcre2api
       page and a description of the POSIX API in the pcre2posix page.
