NAME
       XtToolkitThreadInitialize - initialize the toolkit for multiple threads

SYNTAX
       #include <X11/Intrinsic.h>

       Boolean XtToolkitThreadInitialize(void);

DESCRIPTION
       If XtToolkitThreadInitialize was previously called, it returns.  The application programmer must ensure that two or more threads do not simultaneously attempt to call XtToolkitThreadInitialize;
       the effect of this is undefined.  XtToolkitThreadInitialize returns True if the host operating system has threads and the Intrinsics are thread safe.
