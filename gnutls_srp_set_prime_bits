NAME
       gnutls_srp_set_prime_bits - API function

SYNOPSIS
       #include <gnutls/gnutls.h>

       void gnutls_srp_set_prime_bits(gnutls_session_t session, unsigned int bits);

ARGUMENTS
       gnutls_session_t session
                   is a gnutls_session_t type.

       unsigned int bits
                   is the number of bits

DESCRIPTION
       This function sets the minimum accepted number of bits, for use in an SRP key exchange.  If zero, the default 2048 bits will be used.

       In the client side it sets the minimum accepted number of bits.  If a server sends a prime with less bits than that GNUTLS_E_RECEIVED_ILLEGAL_PARAMETER will be returned by the handshake.

       This function has no effect in server side.

SINCE
       2.6.0
