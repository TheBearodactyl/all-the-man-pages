NAME
       gnutls_pkcs11_obj_get_ptr - API function

SYNOPSIS
       #include <gnutls/pkcs11.h>

       int gnutls_pkcs11_obj_get_ptr(gnutls_pkcs11_obj_t obj, void ** ptr, void ** session, void ** ohandle, unsigned long * slot_id, unsigned int flags);

ARGUMENTS
       gnutls_pkcs11_obj_t obj
                   should contain a gnutls_pkcs11_obj_t type

       void ** ptr will contain the CK_FUNCTION_LIST_PTR pointer (may be NULL)

       void ** session
                   will contain the CK_SESSION_HANDLE of the object

       void ** ohandle
                   will contain the CK_OBJECT_HANDLE of the object

       unsigned long * slot_id
                   the identifier of the slot (may be NULL)

       unsigned int flags
                   Or sequence of GNUTLS_PKCS11_OBJ_* flags

DESCRIPTION
       Obtains the PKCS11 session handles of an object.  session and  ohandle must be deinitialized by the caller. The returned pointers are independent of the  obj lifetime.
