NAME
       TIFFsize - return the size of various items associated with an open TIFF file

SYNOPSIS
          #include <tiffio.h>

       tsize_t TIFFRasterScanlineSize(TIFF *tif)

       uint64_t TIFFRasterScanlineSize64(TIFF *tif)

       tsize_t TIFFScanlineSize(TIFF *tif)

       uint64_t TIFFScanlineSize64(TIFF *tif)

DESCRIPTION
       TIFFScanlineSize() returns the size in bytes of a row of data as it would be returned in a call to TIFFReadScanline(), or as it would be expected in a call to TIFFWriteScanline().  Note that this
       number may be 1/samples-per-pixel if data is stored as separate planes.  The ScanlineSize in case of YCbCrSubsampling is defined as the strip size divided by the strip height, i.e. the size of  a
       pack  of  vertical  subsampling  lines  divided by vertical subsampling. It should thus make sense when multiplied by a multiple of vertical subsampling.  TIFFScanlineSize64() returns the size as
       uint64_t.

       TIFFRasterScanlineSize() returns the size in bytes of a complete decoded and packed raster scanline. Note that this value may be different from the value returned by TIFFScanlineSize() if data is
       stored as separate planes.  TIFFRasterScanlineSize64() returns the size as uint64_t.

DIAGNOSTICS
       None.
