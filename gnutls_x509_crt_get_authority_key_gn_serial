NAME
       gnutls_x509_crt_get_authority_key_gn_serial - API function

SYNOPSIS
       #include <gnutls/x509.h>

       int gnutls_x509_crt_get_authority_key_gn_serial(gnutls_x509_crt_t cert, unsigned int seq, void * alt, size_t * alt_size, unsigned int * alt_type, void * serial, size_t * serial_size, unsigned int
       * critical);

ARGUMENTS
       gnutls_x509_crt_t cert
                   should contain a gnutls_x509_crt_t type

       unsigned int seq
                   specifies the sequence number of the alt name (0 for the first one, 1 for the second etc.)

       void * alt  is the place where the alternative name will be copied to

       size_t * alt_size
                   holds the size of alt.

       unsigned int * alt_type
                   holds the type of the alternative name (one of gnutls_x509_subject_alt_name_t).

       void * serial
                   buffer to store the serial number (may be null)

       size_t * serial_size
                   Holds the size of the serial field (may be null)

       unsigned int * critical
                   will be non-zero if the extension is marked as critical (may be null)

DESCRIPTION
       This function will return the X.509 authority key identifier when stored as a general name (authorityCertIssuer) and serial number.

       Because more than one general names might be stored
        seq can be used as a counter to request them all until GNUTLS_E_REQUESTED_DATA_NOT_AVAILABLE is returned.

RETURNS
       On success, GNUTLS_E_SUCCESS (0) is returned, GNUTLS_E_REQUESTED_DATA_NOT_AVAILABLE if the extension is not present, otherwise a negative error value.

SINCE
       3.0
