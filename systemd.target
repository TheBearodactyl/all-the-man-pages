NAME
       systemd.target - Target unit configuration

SYNOPSIS
       target.target

DESCRIPTION
       A unit configuration file whose name ends in ".target" encodes information about a target unit of systemd, which is used for grouping units and as well-known synchronization points during
       start-up.

       This unit type has no specific options. See systemd.unit(5) for the common options of all unit configuration files. The common configuration items are configured in the generic [Unit] and
       [Install] sections. A separate [Target] section does not exist, since no target-specific options may be configured.

       Target units do not offer any additional functionality on top of the generic functionality provided by units. They exist merely to group units via dependencies (useful as boot targets), and to
       establish standardized names for synchronization points used in dependencies between units. Among other things, target units are a more flexible replacement for SysV runlevels in the classic SysV
       init system. (And for compatibility reasons special target units such as runlevel3.target exist which are used by the SysV runlevel compatibility code in systemd. See systemd.special(7) for
       details).

AUTOMATIC DEPENDENCIES
   Implicit Dependencies
       There are no implicit dependencies for target units.

   Default Dependencies
       The following dependencies are added unless DefaultDependencies=no is set:

       •   Target units will automatically complement all configured dependencies of type Wants= or Requires= with dependencies of type After= unless DefaultDependencies=no is set in the specified
           units. Note that Wants= or Requires= must be defined in the target unit itself — if you for example define Wants=some.target in some.service, the automatic ordering will not be added.

       •   Target units automatically gain Conflicts= and Before= dependencies against shutdown.target.

OPTIONS
       Target unit files may include [Unit] and [Install] sections, which are described in systemd.unit(5). No options specific to this file type are supported.

EXAMPLE
       Example 1. Simple standalone target

           # emergency-net.target

           [Unit]
           Description=Emergency Mode with Networking
           Requires=emergency.target systemd-networkd.service
           After=emergency.target systemd-networkd.service
           AllowIsolate=yes

       When adding dependencies to other units, it's important to check if they set DefaultDependencies=. Service units, unless they set DefaultDependencies=no, automatically get a dependency on
       sysinit.target. In this case, both emergency.target and systemd-networkd.service have DefaultDependencies=no, so they are suitable for use in this target, and do not pull in sysinit.target.

       You can now switch into this emergency mode by running systemctl isolate emergency-net.target or by passing the option systemd.unit=emergency-net.target on the kernel command line.

       Other units can have WantedBy=emergency-net.target in the [Install] section. After they are enabled using systemctl enable, they will be started before emergency-net.target is started. It is also
       possible to add arbitrary units as dependencies of emergency.target without modifying them by using systemctl add-wants.
