NAME
       hwlocality_rsmi - Interoperability with the ROCm SMI Management Library

SYNOPSIS
   Functions
       static int hwloc_rsmi_get_device_cpuset (hwloc_topology_t topology, uint32_t dv_ind, hwloc_cpuset_t set)
       static hwloc_obj_t hwloc_rsmi_get_device_osdev_by_index (hwloc_topology_t topology, uint32_t dv_ind)
       static hwloc_obj_t hwloc_rsmi_get_device_osdev (hwloc_topology_t topology, uint32_t dv_ind)

Detailed Description
       This interface offers ways to retrieve topology information about devices managed by the ROCm SMI Management Library.

Function Documentation
   static int hwloc_rsmi_get_device_cpuset (hwloc_topology_t topology, uint32_t dv_ind, hwloc_cpuset_t set) [inline],  [static]
       Get the CPU set of logical processors that are physically close to AMD GPU device whose index is dv_ind. Store in set the CPU-set describing the locality of the AMD GPU device whose index is
       dv_ind.

       Topology topology and device dv_ind must match the local machine. I/O devices detection and the ROCm SMI component are not needed in the topology.

       The function only returns the locality of the device. If more information about the device is needed, OS objects should be used instead, see hwloc_rsmi_get_device_osdev() and
       hwloc_rsmi_get_device_osdev_by_index().

       This function is currently only implemented in a meaningful way for Linux; other systems will simply get a full cpuset.

   static hwloc_obj_t hwloc_rsmi_get_device_osdev (hwloc_topology_t topology, uint32_t dv_ind) [inline],  [static]
       Get the hwloc OS device object corresponding to AMD GPU device, whose index is dv_ind.

       Returns
           The hwloc OS device object that describes the given AMD GPU, whose index is dv_ind.

           NULL if none could be found.

       Topology topology and device dv_ind must match the local machine. I/O devices detection and the ROCm SMI component must be enabled in the topology. If not, the locality of the object may still be
       found using hwloc_rsmi_get_device_cpuset().

       Note
           The corresponding hwloc PCI device may be found by looking at the result parent pointer (unless PCI devices are filtered out).

   static hwloc_obj_t hwloc_rsmi_get_device_osdev_by_index (hwloc_topology_t topology, uint32_t dv_ind) [inline],  [static]
       Get the hwloc OS device object corresponding to the AMD GPU device whose index is dv_ind.

       Returns
           The hwloc OS device object describing the AMD GPU device whose index is dv_ind.

           NULL if none could be found.

       The topology topology does not necessarily have to match the current machine. For instance the topology may be an XML import of a remote host. I/O devices detection and the ROCm SMI component
       must be enabled in the topology.

       Note
           The corresponding PCI device object can be obtained by looking at the OS device parent object (unless PCI devices are filtered out).
