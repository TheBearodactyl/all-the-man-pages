rdiff(1)                    General Commands Manual                   rdiff(1)

NAME
       rdiff - compute and apply signature-based file differences

SYNOPSYS
       rdiff [options] signature old-file signature-file

       rdiff [options] delta signature-file new-file delta-file

       rdiff [options] patch old-file delta-file new-file

USAGE
       You  can use rdiff to update files, much like rsync does.  However, un‐
       like rsync, rdiff puts you in control.  There are three steps to updat‐
       ing  a  file: signature, delta, and patch. Use the signature subcommand
       to generate a small signature-file from the  old-file.  Use  the  delta
       subcommand  to  generate  a small delta-file from the signature-file to
       the new-file. Use the patch subcommand to apply the delta-file  to  the
       old-file to regenerate the new-file.

DESCRIPTION
       In every case where a filename must be specified, - may be used instead
       to mean either standard input or standard output  as  appropriate.   Be
       aware  that  if you do this, you'll need to terminate your options with
       -- or rdiff will think you are passing it an empty option.

RETURN VALUE
       0 for successful completion, 1 for  environmental  problems  (file  not
       found,  invalid options, IO error, etc), 2 for a corrupt file and 3 for
       an internal error or unhandled situation in librsync or rdiff.
