SYNOPSIS
       #include <xcb/sync.h>

   Request function

   Reply datastructure
       typedef struct xcb_sync_get_priority_reply_t {
           uint8_t  response_type;
           uint8_t  pad0;
           uint16_t sequence;
           uint32_t length;
           int32_t  priority;
       } xcb_sync_get_priority_reply_t;

   Reply function
       xcb_sync_get_priority_reply_t *xcb_sync_get_priority_reply(xcb_connection_t *conn, xcb_sync_get_priority_cookie_t cookie, xcb_generic_error_t **e);

REQUEST ARGUMENTS
       conn      The XCB connection to X11.

       id        TODO: NOT YET DOCUMENTED.

REPLY FIELDS
       response_type
                 The type of this reply, in this case XCB_SYNC_GET_PRIORITY. This field is also present in the xcb_generic_reply_t and can be used to tell replies apart from each other.

       sequence  The sequence number of the last request processed by the X11 server.

       length    The length of the reply, in words (a word is 4 bytes).

       priority  TODO: NOT YET DOCUMENTED.

DESCRIPTION
RETURN VALUE
       Returns an xcb_sync_get_priority_cookie_t. Errors have to be handled when calling the reply function xcb_sync_get_priority_reply.

       If you want to handle errors in the event loop instead, use xcb_sync_get_priority_unchecked. See xcb-requests(3) for details.

ERRORS
       This request does never generate any errors.
