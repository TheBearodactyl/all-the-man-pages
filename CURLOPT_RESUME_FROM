NAME
       CURLOPT_RESUME_FROM - offset to resume transfer from

SYNOPSIS
       #include <curl/curl.h>

       CURLcode curl_easy_setopt(CURL *handle, CURLOPT_RESUME_FROM, long from);

DESCRIPTION
       Pass  a long as parameter. It contains the offset in number of bytes that you want the transfer to start from. Set this option to 0 to make the transfer start from the beginning (effectively dis‚Äê
       abling resume). For FTP, set this option to -1 to make the transfer start from the end of the target file (useful to continue an interrupted upload).

       When doing uploads with FTP, the resume position is where in the local/source file libcurl should try to resume the upload from and it will then append the source file to the remote target file.

       If you need to resume a transfer beyond the 2GB limit, use CURLOPT_RESUME_FROM_LARGE(3) instead.

DEFAULT
       0, not used

PROTOCOLS
       HTTP, FTP, SFTP, FILE

EXAMPLE
       CURL *curl = curl_easy_init();
       if(curl) {
         curl_easy_setopt(curl, CURLOPT_URL, "ftp://example.com");

         /* resume upload at byte index 200 */
         curl_easy_setopt(curl, CURLOPT_RESUME_FROM, 200L);

         /* ask for upload */
         curl_easy_setopt(curl, CURLOPT_UPLOAD, 1L);

         /* set total data amount to expect */
         curl_easy_setopt(curl, CURLOPT_INFILESIZE, size_of_file);

         /* Perform the request */
         curl_easy_perform(curl);
       }
