NAME
       npm-explain - Explain installed packages

   Synopsis
         npm explain <package-spec>

         alias: why

   Description
       This command will print the chain of dependencies causing a given package to be installed in the current project.

       If one or more package specs are provided, then only packages matching one of the specifiers will have their relationships explained.

       The package spec can also refer to a folder within ./node_modules

       For example, running npm explain glob within npm's source tree will show:

         glob@7.1.6
         node_modules/glob
           glob@"^7.1.4" from the root project

         glob@7.1.1 dev
         node_modules/tacks/node_modules/glob
           glob@"^7.0.5" from rimraf@2.6.2
           node_modules/tacks/node_modules/rimraf
             rimraf@"^2.6.2" from tacks@1.3.0
             node_modules/tacks
               dev tacks@"^1.3.0" from the root project

       To  explain  just the package residing at a specific folder, pass that as the argument to the command.  This can be useful when trying to figure out exactly why a given dependency is being dupli‐
       cated to satisfy conflicting version requirements within the project.

         $ npm explain node_modules/nyc/node_modules/find-up
         find-up@3.0.0 dev
         node_modules/nyc/node_modules/find-up
           find-up@"^3.0.0" from nyc@14.1.1
           node_modules/nyc
             nyc@"^14.1.1" from tap@14.10.8
             node_modules/tap
               dev tap@"^14.10.8" from the root project

   Configuration
   json
       • Default: false

       • Type: Boolean

       Whether or not to output JSON data, rather than the normal output.

       • In npm pkg set it enables parsing set values with JSON.parse() before saving them to your package.json.

       Not supported by all npm commands.

   workspace
       • Default:

       • Type: String (can be set multiple times)

       Enable running a command in the context of the configured workspaces of the current project while filtering by running only the workspaces defined by this configuration option.

       Valid values for the workspace config are either:

       • Workspace names

       • Path to a workspace directory

       • Path to a parent workspace directory (will result in selecting all workspaces within that folder)

       When set for the npm init command, this may be set to the folder of a workspace which does not yet exist, to create the folder and set it up as a brand new workspace within the project.

       This value is not exported to the environment for child processes.
