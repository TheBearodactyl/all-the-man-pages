NAME
       idn2_to_ascii_4i2 - API function

SYNOPSIS
       #include <idn2.h>

       int idn2_to_ascii_4i2(const uint32_t * input, size_t inlen, char ** output, int flags);

ARGUMENTS
       const uint32_t * input
                   zero terminated input Unicode (UCS-4) string.

       size_t inlen
                   number of elements in  input .

       char ** output
                   pointer to newly allocated zero-terminated output string.

       int flags   optional idn2_flags to modify behaviour.

DESCRIPTION
       The  ToASCII  operation takes a sequence of Unicode code points that make up one domain label and transforms it into a sequence of code points in the ASCII range (0..7F). If ToASCII succeeds, the
       original sequence and the resulting sequence are equivalent labels.

       It is important to note that the ToASCII operation can fail.  ToASCII fails if any step of it fails. If any step of the ToASCII operation fails on any label in a domain  name,  that  domain  name
       MUST NOT be used as an internationalized domain name.  The method for dealing with this failure is application-specific.

       The inputs to ToASCII are a sequence of code points.

       ToASCII never alters a sequence of code points that are all in the ASCII range to begin with (although it could fail). Applying the ToASCII operation multiple effect as applying it just once.

       The  default  behavior  of this function (when flags are zero) is to apply the IDNA2008 rules without the TR46 amendments. As the TR46 non-transitional processing is nowadays ubiquitous, when un‐
       sure, it is recommended to call this function with the IDN2_NONTRANSITIONAL and the IDN2_NFC_INPUT flags for compatibility with other software.

       Return value: Returns IDN2_OK on success, or error code.
