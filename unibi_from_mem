NAME
       unibi_from_mem - construct a terminal object from a compiled terminfo entry

SYNOPSIS
        #include <unibilium.h>

        unibi_term *unibi_from_mem(const char *p, size_t n);

DESCRIPTION
       This function parses a compiled terminfo entry that starts at p and is n bytes long, and constructs a "unibi_term" object from it. When you're done with this object, you should call
       "unibi_destroy" to free it.

       "unibi_from_mem" parses both the traditional ncurses terminfo format (starting with the bytes "1A 01") and the newer "wide integer" format (starting with the bytes "1E 02").

RETURN VALUE
       A pointer to a new "unibi_term". In case of failure, "NULL" is returned and "errno" is set.

ERRORS
       "EINVAL"
           The bytes p points at don't look like a valid terminfo entry.

       "EFAULT"
           n is too small for a valid terminfo entry.
