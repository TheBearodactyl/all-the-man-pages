SYNOPSIS
          cmake-gui [<options>]

DESCRIPTION
       The  cmake-gui  executable  is the CMake GUI.  Project configuration settings may be specified interactively.  Brief instructions are provided at the bottom of the window when the program is run‐
       ning.

       CMake is a cross-platform build system generator.  Projects specify their build process with platform-independent CMake listfiles included in each directory of a source tree with the name  CMake‐
       Lists.txt.  Users build a project by using CMake to generate a build system for a native tool on their platform.

       -B <path-to-build>

              If the directory doesn't already exist CMake will make it.
