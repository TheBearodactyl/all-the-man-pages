I2D_CMS_BIO_STREAM(3ssl)                                                                          OpenSSL                                                                         I2D_CMS_BIO_STREAM(3ssl)

NAME
       i2d_CMS_bio_stream - output CMS_ContentInfo structure in BER format

SYNOPSIS
        #include <openssl/cms.h>

        int i2d_CMS_bio_stream(BIO *out, CMS_ContentInfo *cms, BIO *data, int flags);

DESCRIPTION
       i2d_CMS_bio_stream() outputs a CMS_ContentInfo structure in BER format.

       It is otherwise identical to the function SMIME_write_CMS().

NOTES
       This function is effectively a version of the i2d_CMS_bio() supporting streaming.

BUGS
       The prefix "i2d" is arguably wrong because the function outputs BER format.

RETURN VALUES
       i2d_CMS_bio_stream() returns 1 for success or 0 for failure.

HISTORY
       The i2d_CMS_bio_stream() function was added in OpenSSL 1.0.0.
