NAME
       gnutls_psk_set_client_credentials - API function

SYNOPSIS
       #include <gnutls/gnutls.h>

       int gnutls_psk_set_client_credentials(gnutls_psk_client_credentials_t res, const char * username, const gnutls_datum_t * key, gnutls_psk_key_flags flags);

ARGUMENTS
       gnutls_psk_client_credentials_t res
                   is a gnutls_psk_client_credentials_t type.

       const char * username
                   is the user's zero-terminated userid

       const gnutls_datum_t * key
                   is the user's key

       gnutls_psk_key_flags flags
                   indicate the format of the key, either GNUTLS_PSK_KEY_RAW or GNUTLS_PSK_KEY_HEX.

DESCRIPTION
       This  function  sets the username and password, in a gnutls_psk_client_credentials_t type.  Those will be used in PSK authentication.   username should be an ASCII string or UTF-8 string. In case
       of a UTF-8 string it is recommended to be following the PRECIS framework for usernames (rfc8265). The key can be either in raw byte format or in Hex format (without the 0x prefix).

RETURNS
       On success, GNUTLS_E_SUCCESS (0) is returned, otherwise an error code is returned.
