NAME
       tss2-tctildr - Simplifiy management of TCTI instance lifecycle.

SYNOPSIS
       This library simplifies the instantiation and finalization of TCTI instances.

DESCRIPTION
       The  TCTI  dynamic loading and initialization protocol requires a lot of boilerplate code. To reduce duplication the tss2-tctildr library adds the Tss2_TctiLdr_Initialize(), Tss2_TctiLdr_Initial‐
       ize_Ex(), and Tss2_TctiLdr_Finalize() functions to abstract away the machinery required to load, initialize, and finalize a TCTI context.

       To assist in the discovery of TCTIs this library provides the Tss2_TctiLdr_GetInfo() function. This function, paired with a ‘free’ function to free the memory allocated by ‘GetInfo’,  provides  a
       simple query interface for discovery of the available and default TCTIs available to the tss2-tctildr implementation

       The interface exposed by this library is defined in the “TSS System Level API and TPM Command Transmission Interface Specification”.
