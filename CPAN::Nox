NAME
       CPAN::Nox - Wrapper around CPAN.pm without using any XS module

SYNOPSIS
       Interactive mode:

         perl -MCPAN::Nox -e shell;

DESCRIPTION
       This package has the same functionality as CPAN.pm, but tries to prevent the usage of compiled extensions during its own execution. Its primary purpose is a rescue in case you upgraded perl and
       broke binary compatibility somehow.
