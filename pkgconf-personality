NAME
     file.personality — pkgconf cross-compile personality file format

DESCRIPTION
     pkgconf cross-compile personality files provide a useful mechanism for storing various information about system toolchains.  Information stored by .personality files include information about paths
     used by a cross-compile toolchain, such as the sysroot directory and default include and library paths.  pkgconf uses this information to determine what information is necessary to use libraries.

   FILE SYNTAX
     The .personality file follows a format inspired by RFC822.  Comments are prefixed by a pound sign, hash sign or octothorpe (#), and variable assignment is similar to POSIX shell.  Properties are
     defined using RFC822-style stanzas.

   PROPERTIES
     Properties are set using RFC822-style stanzas which consist of a keyword, followed by a colon (:) and then the value the property should be set to.  Variable substitution is always performed re‐
     gardless of property type.

     There are three types of property:

     Literal
             The property will be set to the text of the value.

     Fragment List
             The property will be set to a list of fragments parsed from the text.  The input text must be in a format that is suitable for passing to a POSIX shell without any shell expansions after
             variable substitution has been done.  Elements are delimited with a colon.

     Boolean
             The property will be set to true if the value is one of: true, yes or 1.  Otherwise it will be set to false.

   PROPERTY KEYWORDS
     Triplet
             The triplet used by the cross-compile toolchain.  (mandatory; literal)

     SysrootDir
             The directory used by the system root of the cross-compile toolchain.  (mandatory; literal)

     DefaultSearchPaths
             A list of directories to look for pc(5) files in.  (mandatory; fragment list)

     SystemIncludePaths
             A list of directories that are included by default in the search path for include files.  (mandatory; fragment list)

     SystemLibraryPaths
             A list of directories that are included by default in the search path for libraries.  (mandatory; fragment list)

     WantDefaultPure
             If true, pkgconf will default to preferring a pure dependency graph.  (optional; boolean; default is false)

     WantDefaultStatic
             If true, pkgconf will default to operating in static linking mode.  (optional; boolean; default is false)

EXAMPLES
     An example .personality file:

     # This is a comment
     Triplet: x86_64-pc-linux-gnu
     SysrootDir: /home/kaniini/sysroot/x86_64-pc-linux-gnu
