NAME
       zoxide - a smarter cd command

SYNOPSIS
       zoxide SUBCOMMAND [OPTIONS]

DESCRIPTION
       zoxide is a smarter cd command for your terminal. It keeps track of the directories you use most frequently, and uses a ranking algorithm to navigate to the best match.

USAGE
       z foo              # cd into highest ranked directory matching foo
       z foo bar          # cd into highest ranked directory matching foo and bar
       z foo /            # cd into a subdirectory starting with foo

       z ~/foo            # z also works like a regular cd command
       z foo/             # cd into relative path
       z ..               # cd one level up
       z -                # cd into previous directory

       zi foo             # cd with interactive selection (using fzf)

       z foo<SPACE><TAB>  # show interactive completions (bash 4.4+/fish/zsh only)

       -h, --help
              Print help information.

       -V, --version
              Print version information.

ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
       Environment variables can be used for configuration. They must be set before zoxide-init(1) is called.

       _ZO_DATA_DIR
              Specifies the directory in which the database is stored. The default value varies across OSes:

                  OS          Path
                  Linux/BSD   $XDG_DATA_HOME or $HOME/.local/share, eg.  /home/alice/.local/share
                  macOS       $HOME/Library/Application Support, eg.  /Users/Alice/Library/Appli‚Äê
                              cation Support
                  Windows     %LOCALAPPDATA%, eg. C:\Users\Alice\AppData\Local

       _ZO_ECHO
              When set to 1, z will print the matched directory before navigating to it.

       _ZO_EXCLUDE_DIRS
              Prevents the specified directories from being added to the database. This is provided as a list of globs, separated by OS-specific characters:

                  OS                Separator
                  Linux/macOS/BSD   :, eg. $HOME:$HOME/private/*
                  Windows           ;, eg. $HOME;$HOME/private/*

              By default, this is set to $HOME. After setting this up, you might need to use zoxide-remove(1) to remove any existing entries from the database.

       _ZO_FZF_OPTS
              Custom options to pass to fzf(1) during interactive selection. See the manpage for the full list of options.

       _ZO_MAXAGE
              Configures the aging algorithm, which limits the maximum number of entries in the database. By default, this is set to 10000.

       _ZO_RESOLVE_SYMLINKS
              When set to 1, z will resolve symlinks before adding directories to the database.

ALGORITHM
       AGING  zoxide uses a parameter called _ZO_MAXAGE to limit the number of entries in the database based on usage patterns. If the total FRECENCY of the directories  in  the  database  exceeds  this
              value,  we divide each directory's score by a factor k - such that the new total becomes ~90% of _ZO_MAXAGE. Thereafter, if the new score of any directory falls below 1, it is removed from
              the database.

              Theoretically, the maximum number of directories in the database is 4 * _ZO_MAXAGE, although it is lower in practice.

       FRECENCY
              Each directory in zoxide is given a score, starting with 1 the first time it is accessed. Every subsequent access increases the score by 1. When a query  is  made,  we  calculate  frecency
              based on the last time the directory was accessed:

                  Last access time       Frecency
                  Within the last hour   score * 4
                  Within the last day    score * 2
                  Within the last week   score / 2
                  Otherwise              score / 4
