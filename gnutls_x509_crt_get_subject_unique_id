NAME
       gnutls_x509_crt_get_subject_unique_id - API function

SYNOPSIS
       #include <gnutls/x509.h>

       int gnutls_x509_crt_get_subject_unique_id(gnutls_x509_crt_t crt, char * buf, size_t * buf_size);

ARGUMENTS
       gnutls_x509_crt_t crt
                   Holds the certificate

       char * buf  user allocated memory buffer, will hold the unique id

       size_t * buf_size
                   size of user allocated memory buffer (on input), will hold actual size of the unique ID on return.

DESCRIPTION
       This function will extract the subjectUniqueID value (if present) for the given certificate.

       If  the  user  allocated  memory  buffer  is  not large enough to hold the full subjectUniqueID, then a GNUTLS_E_SHORT_MEMORY_BUFFER error will be returned, and buf_size will be set to the actual
       length.

       This function had a bug prior to 3.4.8 that prevented the setting of NULL  buf to discover the  buf_size . To use this function safely with the older versions the  buf must be a valid buffer that
       can hold at least a single byte if  buf_size is zero.

RETURNS
       GNUTLS_E_SUCCESS on success, otherwise a negative error code.
