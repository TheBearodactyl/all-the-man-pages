NAME
       gnutls_pcert_import_rawpk - API function

SYNOPSIS
       #include <gnutls/abstract.h>

       int gnutls_pcert_import_rawpk(gnutls_pcert_st * pcert, gnutls_pubkey_t pubkey, unsigned int flags);

ARGUMENTS
       gnutls_pcert_st * pcert
                   The pcert structure to import the data into.

       gnutls_pubkey_t pubkey
                   The raw public-key in gnutls_pubkey_t format to be imported

       unsigned int flags
                   zero for now

DESCRIPTION
       This convenience function will import (i.e. convert) the given raw public key  pubkey into a gnutls_pcert_st structure. The structure must be deinitialized afterwards using gnutls_pcert_deinit().
       The given  pubkey must not be deinitialized because it will be associated with the given  pcert structure and will be deinitialized with it.

RETURNS
       On success, GNUTLS_E_SUCCESS (0) is returned, otherwise a negative error value.

SINCE
       3.6.6
