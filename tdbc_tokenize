NAME
       tdbc::tokenize - TDBC SQL tokenizer

SYNOPSIS
       package require tdbc 1.0

       tdbc::tokenize string
__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

DESCRIPTION
       As a convenience to database drivers, Tcl Database Connectivity (TDBC) provides a command to break SQL code apart into tokens so that bound variables can readily be identified and substituted.

       The  tdbc::tokenize command accepts as its parameter a string that is expected to contain one or more SQL statements. It returns a list of substrings; concatenating these substrings together will
       yield the original string. Each substring is one of the following:

       [1]    A bound variable, which begins with one of the characters ':', '@', or '$'. The remainder of the string is the variable name and will consist of alphanumeric  characters  and  underscores.
              (The leading character will be be non-numeric.)

       [2]    A semicolon that separates two SQL statements.

       [3]    Something  else  in  a SQL statement. The tokenizer does not attempt to parse SQL; it merely identifies bound variables (distinguishing them from similar strings appearing inside quotes or
              comments) and statement delimiters.
