NAME
       XkbLockModifiers -  Locks and unlocks any of the eight real keyboard modifiers

SYNOPSIS
       Bool XkbLockModifiers (Display *display, unsigned int device_spec, unsigned int affect, unsigned int values);

ARGUMENTS
       display
              connection to the X server

              device ID, or XkbUseCoreKbd

       affect mask of real modifiers whose lock state is to change

       values 1 => lock, 0 => unlock; only for modifiers selected by affect

DESCRIPTION
       XkbLockModifiers  sends  a request to the server to lock the real modifiers selected by both affect and values and to unlock the real modifiers selected by affect, but not selected by values. Xk‐
       bLockModifiers does not wait for a reply from the server. It returns True if the request was sent, and False otherwise.

       The functions in this section that change the use of modifiers use a mask in the parameter affect. It is a bitwise inclusive OR of the legal modifier masks:
