NAME
       gnutls_record_recv_seq - API function

SYNOPSIS
       #include <gnutls/gnutls.h>

       ssize_t gnutls_record_recv_seq(gnutls_session_t session, void * data, size_t data_size, unsigned char * seq);

ARGUMENTS
       gnutls_session_t session
                   is a gnutls_session_t type.

       void * data the buffer that the data will be read into

       size_t data_size
                   the number of requested bytes

       unsigned char * seq
                   is the packet's 64-bit sequence number. Should have space for 8 bytes.

DESCRIPTION
       This  function  is  the  same  as gnutls_record_recv(), except that it returns in addition to data, the sequence number of the data.  This is useful in DTLS where record packets might be received
       out-of-order. The returned 8-byte sequence number is an integer in big-endian format and should be treated as a unique message identification.

RETURNS
       The number of bytes received and zero on EOF.  A negative error code is returned in case of an error.  The number of bytes received might be less than  data_size .

SINCE
       3.0
