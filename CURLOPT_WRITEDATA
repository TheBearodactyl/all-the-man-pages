NAME
       CURLOPT_WRITEDATA - pointer passed to the write callback

SYNOPSIS
       #include <curl/curl.h>

       CURLcode curl_easy_setopt(CURL *handle, CURLOPT_WRITEDATA, void *pointer);

DESCRIPTION
       A  data  pointer  to  pass to the write callback. If you use the CURLOPT_WRITEFUNCTION(3) option, this is the pointer you will get in that callback's fourth and last argument. If you do not use a
       write callback, you must make pointer a 'FILE *' (cast to 'void *') as libcurl will pass this to fwrite(3) when writing data.

       The internal CURLOPT_WRITEFUNCTION(3) will write the data to the FILE * given with this option, or to stdout if this option has not been set.

       If you are using libcurl as a win32 DLL, you MUST use a CURLOPT_WRITEFUNCTION(3) if you set this option or you will experience crashes.

DEFAULT
       By default, this is a FILE * to stdout.

PROTOCOLS
       Used for all protocols.

EXAMPLE
       A common technique is to use the write callback to store the incoming data into a dynamically growing allocated buffer, and then this CURLOPT_WRITEDATA(3) is used to point to a struct or the buf‚Äê
       fer to store data in. Like in the getinmemory example: https://curl.se/libcurl/c/getinmemory.html

AVAILABILITY
       Available in all libcurl versions. This option was formerly known as CURLOPT_FILE, the name CURLOPT_WRITEDATA(3) was introduced in 7.9.7.

RETURN VALUE
       This will return CURLE_OK.
