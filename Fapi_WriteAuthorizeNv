Function Documentation
   Fapi_WriteAuthorizeNv (FAPI_CONTEXT * context, char const * nvPath, char const * policyPath)
       One-Call function for Fapi_WriteAuthorizeNv

       Write the policyDigest of a policy to an NV index so it can be used in policies containing PolicyAuthorizeNV elements.

       Parameters
           context The FAPI_CONTEXT
           nvPath The path of the NV index
           policyPath The path of the new policy

       Return values
           TSS2_RC_SUCCESS if the function call was a success.
           TSS2_FAPI_RC_BAD_REFERENCE if context or path is NULL.
           TSS2_FAPI_RC_BAD_CONTEXT if context corruption is detected.
           TSS2_FAPI_RC_BAD_PATH if nvPath or policyPath does not map to a FAPI policy or NV index.
           TSS2_FAPI_RC_BAD_SEQUENCE if the context has an asynchronous operation already pending.
           TSS2_FAPI_RC_IO_ERROR if the data cannot be saved.
           TSS2_FAPI_RC_MEMORY if the FAPI cannot allocate enough memory for internal operations or return parameters.
           TSS2_FAPI_RC_NO_TPM if FAPI was initialized in no-TPM-mode via its config file.
           TSS2_FAPI_RC_PATH_NOT_FOUND if a FAPI object path was not found during authorization.
           TSS2_FAPI_RC_KEY_NOT_FOUND if a key was not found.
           TSS2_FAPI_RC_BAD_VALUE if an invalid value was passed into the function.
           TSS2_FAPI_RC_TRY_AGAIN if an I/O operation is not finished yet and this function needs to be called again.
           TSS2_FAPI_RC_GENERAL_FAILURE if an internal error occurred.
           TSS2_ESYS_RC_* possible error codes of ESAPI.
           TSS2_FAPI_RC_NOT_PROVISIONED FAPI was not provisioned.
           TSS2_FAPI_RC_AUTHORIZATION_UNKNOWN if a required authorization callback is not set.
           TSS2_FAPI_RC_AUTHORIZATION_FAILED if the authorization attempt fails.
           TSS2_FAPI_RC_POLICY_UNKNOWN if policy search for a certain policy digest was not successful.

   Fapi_WriteAuthorizeNv_Async (FAPI_CONTEXT * context, char const * nvPath, char const * policyPath)
       Asynchronous function for Fapi_WriteAuthorizeNv

       Write the policyDigest of a policy to an NV index so it can be used in policies containing PolicyAuthorizeNV elements.

       Call Fapi_WriteAuthorizeNv_Finish to finish the execution of this command.

       Parameters
           context The FAPI_CONTEXT
           nvPath The path of the NV index
           policyPath The path of the new policy

       Return values
           TSS2_RC_SUCCESS if the function call was a success.
           TSS2_FAPI_RC_BAD_REFERENCE if context or path is NULL.
           TSS2_FAPI_RC_BAD_CONTEXT if context corruption is detected.
           TSS2_FAPI_RC_BAD_PATH if nvPath or policyPath does not map to a FAPI policy or NV index.
           TSS2_FAPI_RC_BAD_SEQUENCE if the context has an asynchronous operation already pending.
           TSS2_FAPI_RC_IO_ERROR if the data cannot be saved.
           TSS2_FAPI_RC_MEMORY if the FAPI cannot allocate enough memory for internal operations or return parameters.
           TSS2_FAPI_RC_NO_TPM if FAPI was initialized in no-TPM-mode via its config file.
           TSS2_FAPI_RC_PATH_NOT_FOUND if a FAPI object path was not found during authorization.
           TSS2_FAPI_RC_KEY_NOT_FOUND if a key was not found.
           TSS2_FAPI_RC_BAD_VALUE if an invalid value was passed into the function.
           TSS2_FAPI_RC_NOT_PROVISIONED FAPI was not provisioned.

   Fapi_WriteAuthorizeNv_Finish (FAPI_CONTEXT * context)
       Asynchronous finish function for Fapi_WriteAuthorizeNv

       This function should be called after a previous Fapi_WriteAuthorizeNv_Async.

       Parameters
           context The FAPI_CONTEXT

       Return values
           TSS2_RC_SUCCESS if the function call was a success.
           TSS2_FAPI_RC_BAD_REFERENCE if context is NULL.
           TSS2_FAPI_RC_BAD_CONTEXT if context corruption is detected.
           TSS2_FAPI_RC_BAD_SEQUENCE if the context has an asynchronous operation already pending.
           TSS2_FAPI_RC_IO_ERROR if the data cannot be saved.
           TSS2_FAPI_RC_MEMORY if the FAPI cannot allocate enough memory for internal operations or return parameters.
           TSS2_FAPI_RC_TRY_AGAIN if the asynchronous operation is not yet complete. Call this function again later.
           TSS2_FAPI_RC_BAD_VALUE if an invalid value was passed into the function.
           TSS2_FAPI_RC_GENERAL_FAILURE if an internal error occurred.
           TSS2_FAPI_RC_PATH_NOT_FOUND if a FAPI object path was not found during authorization.
           TSS2_FAPI_RC_KEY_NOT_FOUND if a key was not found.
           TSS2_ESYS_RC_* possible error codes of ESAPI.
           TSS2_FAPI_RC_BAD_PATH if the path is used in inappropriate context or contains illegal characters.
           TSS2_FAPI_RC_NOT_PROVISIONED FAPI was not provisioned.
           TSS2_FAPI_RC_AUTHORIZATION_UNKNOWN if a required authorization callback is not set.
           TSS2_FAPI_RC_AUTHORIZATION_FAILED if the authorization attempt fails.
