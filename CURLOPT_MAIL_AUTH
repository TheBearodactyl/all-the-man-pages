NAME
       CURLOPT_MAIL_AUTH - SMTP authentication address

SYNOPSIS
       #include <curl/curl.h>

       CURLcode curl_easy_setopt(CURL *handle, CURLOPT_MAIL_AUTH, char *auth);

DESCRIPTION
       Pass a pointer to a null-terminated string as parameter. This will be used to specify the authentication address (identity) of a submitted message that is being relayed to another server.

       This  optional  parameter  allows  co-operating  agents in a trusted environment to communicate the authentication of individual messages and should only be used by the application program, using
       libcurl, if the application is itself a mail server acting in such an environment. If the application is operating as such and the AUTH address is not known or is invalid, then  an  empty  string
       should be used for this parameter.

       Unlike  CURLOPT_MAIL_FROM(3)  and CURLOPT_MAIL_RCPT(3), the address should not be specified within a pair of angled brackets (<>). However, if an empty string is used then a pair of brackets will
       be sent by libcurl as required by RFC2554.

       The application does not have to keep the string around after setting this option.

DEFAULT
       NULL

PROTOCOLS
       SMTP

EXAMPLE
       CURL *curl = curl_easy_init();
       if(curl) {
         curl_easy_setopt(curl, CURLOPT_URL, "smtp://example.com/");
         curl_easy_setopt(curl, CURLOPT_MAIL_AUTH, "<secret@cave>");
         ret = curl_easy_perform(curl);
         curl_easy_cleanup(curl);
       }

AVAILABILITY
       Added in 7.25.0

RETURN VALUE
       Returns CURLE_OK if the option is supported, CURLE_UNKNOWN_OPTION if not, or CURLE_OUT_OF_MEMORY if there was insufficient heap space.
