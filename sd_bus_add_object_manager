NAME
       sd_bus_add_object_manager - Add a D-Bus object manager for a D-Bus
       object sub-tree

SYNOPSIS
       #include <systemd/sd-bus.h>

       int sd_bus_add_object_manager(sd_bus *bus, sd_bus_slot **slot,
                                     const char *path);

DESCRIPTION
       sd_bus_add_object_manager() installs a handler for the given path that
       implements the GetManagedObjects() method of the
       org.freedesktop.DBus.ObjectManager interface. See
       org.freedesktop.DBus.ObjectManager[1] for more information.

       To implement the InterfacesAdded and InterfacesRemoved signals of the
       org.freedesktop.DBus.ObjectManager interface, call
       sd_bus_emit_interfaces_added(3) and sd_bus_emit_interfaces_removed(3)
       whenever interfaces are added or removed from the sub-tree,
       respectively.

       When sd_bus_add_object_manager() succeeds, a slot is created
       internally. If the output parameter slot is NULL, a "floating" slot
       object is created, see sd_bus_slot_set_floating(3). Otherwise, a
       pointer to the slot object is returned. In that case, the reference to
       the slot object should be dropped when the object manager is not needed
       anymore, see sd_bus_slot_unref(3).

RETURN VALUE
       On success, sd_bus_add_object_manager() returns a non-negative integer.
       On failure, it returns a negative errno-style error code.

   Errors
       Returned errors may indicate the following problems:

       -EINVAL
           One of the required parameters is NULL or path is not a valid
           object path.

       -ENOPKG
           The bus cannot be resolved.

       -ECHILD
           The bus was created in a different process.

       -ENOMEM
           Memory allocation failed.

NOTES
       These APIs are implemented as a shared library, which can be compiled
       and linked to with the libsystemd pkg-config(1) file.
