DESCRIPTION
       PEM_X509_INFO_read_ex() loads the X509_INFO objects from a file fp.

       PEM_X509_INFO_read() is similar to PEM_X509_INFO_read_ex() but uses the
       default (NULL) library context libctx and empty property query propq.

       PEM_X509_INFO_read_bio_ex() loads the X509_INFO objects using a bio bp.

       PEM_X509_INFO_read_bio() is similar to PEM_X509_INFO_read_bio_ex() but
       uses the default (NULL) library context libctx and empty property query
       propq.

       Each of the loaded X509_INFO objects can contain a CRL, a certificate,
       and/or a private key.  The elements are read sequentially, and as far
       as they are of different type than the elements read before, they are
       combined into the same X509_INFO object.  The idea behind this is that
       if, for instance, a certificate is followed by a private key, the
       private key is supposed to correspond to the certificate.

       If the input stack sk is NULL a new stack is allocated, else the given
       stack is extended.

       The optional cb and u parameters can be used for providing a pass
       phrase needed for decrypting encrypted PEM structures (normally only
       private keys).  See PEM_read_bio_PrivateKey(3) and
       passphrase-encoding(7) for details.

       The library context libctx and property query propq are used for
       fetching algorithms from providers.

RETURN VALUES
       PEM_X509_INFO_read_ex(), PEM_X509_INFO_read(),
       PEM_X509_INFO_read_bio_ex() and PEM_X509_INFO_read_bio() return a stack
       of X509_INFO objects or NULL on failure.
