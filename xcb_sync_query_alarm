       length    The length of the reply, in words (a word is 4 bytes).

       trigger   TODO: NOT YET DOCUMENTED.

       delta     TODO: NOT YET DOCUMENTED.

       state     TODO: NOT YET DOCUMENTED.

DESCRIPTION
RETURN VALUE
       Returns an xcb_sync_query_alarm_cookie_t. Errors have to be handled when calling the reply function xcb_sync_query_alarm_reply.

       If you want to handle errors in the event loop instead, use xcb_sync_query_alarm_unchecked. See xcb-requests(3) for details.
