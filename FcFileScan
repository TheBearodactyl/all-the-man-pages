NAME
       FcFileScan - scan a font file

SYNOPSIS
       #include <fontconfig/fontconfig.h>

       FcBool FcFileScan (FcFontSet *set, FcStrSet *dirs, FcFileCache *cache, FcBlanks *blanks, const FcChar8 *file, FcBool force);

DESCRIPTION
       Scans  a single file and adds all fonts found to set.  If force is FcTrue, then the file is scanned even if associated information is found in cache.  If file is a directory, it is added to dirs.
       Whether fonts are found depends on fontconfig policy as well as the current configuration. Internally, fontconfig will ignore BDF and PCF fonts which are not in Unicode (or the effectively equiv‚Äê
       alent ISO Latin-1) encoding as those are not usable by Unicode-based applications. The configuration can ignore fonts based on filename or contents of the font file itself. Returns FcFalse if any
       of the fonts cannot be added (due to allocation failure). Otherwise returns FcTrue.
