POLYBAR(1)                    Polybar User Manual                   POLYBAR(1)

NAME
       polybar - A fast and easy-to-use tool status bar

SYNOPSIS
       polybar [OPTIONS]... [BAR]

DESCRIPTION
       Polybar aims to help users build beautiful and highly customizable sta‐
       tus bars for their desktop environment, without the need  of  having  a
       black belt in shell scripting.  If the BAR argument is not provided and
       the configuration file only contains one bar definition,  polybar  will
       display this bar.

OPTIONS
       -h, --help
              Display help text and exit

       -v, --version
              Display build details and exit

       -l, --log=LEVEL
              Set the logging verbosity (default: notice)
              LEVEL is one of: error, warning, notice, info, trace

       -q, --quiet
              Be quiet (will override -l)

       -c, --config=FILE
              Specify the path to the configuration file. By default, the con‐
              figuration file is loaded from:

              • $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/polybar/config

              • $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/polybar/config.ini

              • $HOME/.config/polybar/config

              • $HOME/.config/polybar/config.ini

              • $XDG_CONFIG_DIRS/polybar/config.ini

              • /etc/xdg/polybar/config.ini (only if  XDG_CONFIG_DIRS  is  not
                set)

              • /etc/polybar/config.ini

       -r, --reload
              Reload the application when the config file has been modified

       -d, --dump=PARAM
              Print  the value of the specified parameter PARAM in bar section
              and exit

       -m, --list-monitors
              Print list of available monitors and exit.
              If some monitors are cloned, this will exclude all but one of them.
              If polybar was compiled with RandR monitor support, only monitors are listed and not physical outputs.

       -M, --list-all-monitors
              Print list of all available monitors and exit.
              This includes cloned monitors as well as both physical outputs and RandR monitors (if supported).
              Only the names listed here can be used as monitor names in polybar.

       -w, --print-wmname
              Print the generated WM_NAME and exit

       -s, --stdout
              Output the data to stdout instead of drawing it to the X window

       -p, --png=FILE
              Save png snapshot to FILE after running for 3 seconds

POLYBAR(5)                    Polybar User Manual                   POLYBAR(5)

NAME
       polybar - configuration file for polybar(1)

DESCRIPTION
       The  polybar  configuration file defines the behavior and look of poly‐
       bar. It uses a variant of the INI file format.  The exact syntax is de‐
       scribed  below  but first a small snippet to get familiar with the syn‐
       tax:

          [section_name]
          ; A comment
          # Another comment

          background = #ff992a
          width = 90%
          monitor = HDMI-0

          screenchange-reload = false

          ; Use double quotes if you want to keep the surrounding space.
          text = " Some text "

       When started polybar will search for the config file in one of  several
       places in the following order:

       • If the -c or --config command line argument is specified, it will use
         the path given there.

       • $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/polybar/config

       • $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/polybar/config.ini

       • $HOME/.config/polybar/config

       • $HOME/.config/polybar/config.ini

       • $XDG_CONFIG_DIRS/polybar/config.ini

       • /etc/xdg/polybar/config.ini (only if XDG_CONFIG_DIRS is not set)

       • /etc/polybar/config.ini

SYNTAX
       The entire config is line-based so everything is constrained to a  sin‐
       gle  line.  This means there are no multiline values or other multiline
       constructs (except for sections).  Each line has one of four types:

       • Empty

       • Comment

       • Section Header

       • Key

       Spaces at the beginning and end of each line will be ignored.

       NOTE:
          In this context "spaces" include the regular space character as well
          as  the  tab  character and any other character for which isspace(3)
          returns true (e.g. \r).

       Any line that doesn't fit into one of these four types is a syntax  er‐
       ror.

       NOTE:
          It  is  recommended that section header names and key names only use
          alphanumeric characters as well as dashes (-), underscores  (_)  and
          forward slashes (/).

          In  practice all characters are allowed except for spaces and any of
          these: "'=;#[](){}:.$\%

   Section Headers
       Sections are used to group config options together.  For  example  each
       module is defined in its own section.

       A  section  is  defined  by  placing  the name of the section in square
       brackets ([ and ]). For example:

          [module/wm]

       This declares a section with the name module/wm and  all  keys  defined
       after  this line will belong to that section until a new section is de‐
       clared.

       WARNING:
          The first non-empty and non-comment line in  the  main  config  file
          must  be a section header. It cannot be a key because that key would
          not belong to any section.

       NOTE:
          The following section names are reserved and cannot be  used  inside
          the config: self, root, and BAR.

   Keys
       Keys are defined by assigning a value to a name like this:

          name = value

       This assigns value to the key name in whatever section this line is in.
       Key names need to be unique per section.  If the value is  enclosed  by
       double-quotes  ("), the quotes will be ignored.  So the following still
       assigns value to name:

          name = "value"

       Spaces around the equal sign are ignored, the following are all equiva‐
       lent:

          name=value
          name = value
          name =      value

       Because  spaces  at the beginning and end of the line are also ignored,
       if you want your value to begin and/or end  with  a  space,  the  value
       needs to be enclosed in double-quotes:

          name = " value "

       Here the value of the name key has a leading and trailing whitespace.

       To  treat  characters  with  special meaning as literal characters, you
       need to prepend them with the backslash (\) escape character:

          name = "value\\value\\value"

       Value of this key name results in value\value\value.

       NOTE:
          The only character with a special meaning right now is the backslash
          character  (\),  which serves as the escape character.  More will be
          added in the future.

   Empty Lines & Comments
       Empty lines and comment lines are ignored when reading the config file,
       they  do not affect polybar's behavior. Comment lines start with either
       the ; or the # character.

       NOTE:
          Inline comments are not supported. For example  the  following  line
          does  not  end  with a comment, the value of name is actually set to
          value ; comment:

              name = value ; comment
