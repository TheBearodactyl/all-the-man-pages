OSSL_ITEM(3ssl)                     OpenSSL                    OSSL_ITEM(3ssl)

NAME
       OSSL_ITEM - OpenSSL Core type for generic itemized data

SYNOPSIS
        #include <openssl/core.h>

        typedef struct ossl_item_st OSSL_ITEM;
        struct ossl_item_st {
            unsigned int id;
            void *ptr;
        };

DESCRIPTION
       This type is a tuple of integer and pointer.  It's a generic type used
       as a generic descriptor, its exact meaning being defined by how it's
       used.  Arrays of this type are passed between the OpenSSL libraries and
       the providers, and must be terminated with a tuple where the integer is
       zero and the pointer NULL.

       This is currently mainly used for the return value of the provider's
       error reason strings array, see "Provider Functions" in
       provider-base(7).
