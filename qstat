NAME
       qstat — show status of batch jobs

SYNOPSIS
       qstat [-f] job_identifier...

       qstat -Q [-f] destination...

       qstat -B [-f] server_name...

DESCRIPTION
       The status of a batch job, batch queue, or batch server is obtained  by
       a  request  to the server. The qstat utility is a user-accessible batch
       client that requests the status  of  one  or  more  batch  jobs,  batch
       queues,  or servers, and writes the status information to standard out‐
       put.

       For each successfully processed batch job_identifier, the qstat utility
       shall display information about the corresponding batch job.

       For  each  successfully  processed destination, the qstat utility shall
       display information about the corresponding batch queue.

       For each successfully processed server name, the  qstat  utility  shall
       display information about the corresponding server.

       The qstat utility shall acquire batch job status information by sending
       a Job Status Request to a batch server. The qstat utility shall acquire
       batch  queue  status information by sending a Queue Status Request to a
       batch server. The qstat utility shall acquire server status information
       by sending a Server Status Request to a batch server.

OPTIONS
       The  qstat  utility  shall  conform  to  the Base Definitions volume of
       POSIX.1‐2017, Section 12.2, Utility Syntax Guidelines.

       The following options shall be supported by the implementation:

       -f        Specify that a full display is produced.

                 The minimum contents of a full display are specified  in  the
                 STDOUT section.

                 Additional  contents  and format of a full display are imple‐
                 mentation-defined.

       -Q        Specify that the operand is a destination.

                 The qstat utility shall display information about each  batch
                 queue at each destination identified as an operand.

       -B        Specify that the operand is a server name.

                 The qstat utility shall display information about each server
                 identified as an operand.

OPERANDS
       If the -Q option is presented to the qstat utility, the  utility  shall
       accept  one  or more operands that conform to the syntax for a destina‐
       tion (see Section 3.3.2, Destination).

       If the -B option is presented to the qstat utility, the  utility  shall
       accept one or more server_name operands.

       If  neither the -B nor the -Q option is presented to the qstat utility,
       the utility shall accept one or more operands that conform to the  syn‐
       tax  for  a  batch job_identifier (see Section 3.3.1, Batch Job Identi‐
       fier).

STDIN
       Not used.

INPUT FILES
       None.

ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
       The following environment variables shall affect the execution  of  qs‐
       tat:

       HOME      Determine the pathname of the user's home directory.

       LANG      Provide  a  default  value for the internationalization vari‐
                 ables that are unset or null. (See the Base Definitions  vol‐
                 ume  of POSIX.1‐2017, Section 8.2, Internationalization Vari‐
                 ables the precedence of internationalization  variables  used
                 to determine the values of locale categories.)

       LC_ALL    If  set  to  a non-empty string value, override the values of
                 all the other internationalization variables.

       LC_COLLATE
                 Determine the locale for the behavior of ranges,  equivalence
                 classes,  and multi-character collating elements within regu‐
                 lar expressions.

       LC_CTYPE  Determine the locale for the interpretation of  sequences  of
                 bytes of text data as characters (for example, single-byte as
                 opposed to multi-byte characters in arguments).

       LC_MESSAGES
                 Determine the locale that should be used to affect the format
                 and  contents  of diagnostic messages written to standard er‐
                 ror.

       LC_NUMERIC
                 Determine the locale for selecting the radix  character  used
                 when writing floating-point formatted output.

ASYNCHRONOUS EVENTS
       Default.

STDOUT
       If  an operand presented to the qstat utility is a batch job_identifier
       and the -f option is not specified, the qstat utility shall display the

           batch queue

       If  the operands presented to the qstat utility are batch server names,
       the -B option is specified, and the -f option is not specified, the qs‐
       tat  utility shall display the following items on a single line, in the
       stated order, with white space between each item, for each successfully
       processed operand:

           of the state

       If the operands presented to the qstat utility are server names, the -B
       option is specified, and the -f option is specified, the qstat  utility
       shall display the following items for each successfully processed oper‐
       and:

STDERR
       The standard error shall be used only for diagnostic messages.

OUTPUT FILES
       None.

EXTENDED DESCRIPTION
       None.

EXIT STATUS
       The following exit values shall be returned:

        0    Successful completion.

       >0    An error occurred.

CONSEQUENCES OF ERRORS
       In addition to the default behavior, the qstat utility shall not be re‐
       quired to write a diagnostic message to standard error when  the  error
       reply received from a batch server indicates that the batch job_identi‐
       fier does not exist on the server. Whether or  not  the  qstat  utility
       waits  to  output the diagnostic message while attempting to locate the
       batch job on other servers is implementation-defined.

       The following sections are informative.

APPLICATION USAGE
       None.

EXAMPLES
       None.

RATIONALE
       The qstat utility allows users to display the status of jobs  and  list
       the batch jobs in queues.

       The operands of the qstat utility may be either job identifiers, queues
       (specified as destination identifiers), or batch server names.  The  -Q
       and  -B  options,  or absence thereof, indicate the nature of the oper‐
       ands.

       The other options of the qstat utility allow the user  to  control  the
       amount  of  information  displayed  and  the format in which it is dis‐
       played. Should a user wish to display the status of a set of jobs  that
       match  a selection criteria, the qselect utility may be used to acquire
       such a list.

       The -f option allows users to request a ``full'' display in  an  imple‐
       mentation-defined format.

       Historically,  the qstat utility has been a part of the NQS and its de‐
       rivatives, the existing practice on which it is based.

FUTURE DIRECTIONS
       The qstat utility may be removed in a future version.
