DESCRIPTION
       ldns_buffer_write_at() writes the given data to the buffer at the specified position
              buffer: the buffer
              at: the position (in number of bytes) to write the data at
              data: pointer to the data to write to the buffer
              count: the number of bytes of data to write

       ldns_buffer_write() writes count bytes of data to the current position of the buffer
              buffer: the buffer
              data: the data to write
              count: the length of the data to write

       ldns_buffer_write_string_at() copies the given (null-delimited) string to the specified position at the buffer
              buffer: the buffer
              at: the position in the buffer
              str: the string to write

       ldns_buffer_write_string() copies the given (null-delimited) string to the current position at the buffer
              buffer: the buffer
              str: the string to write

       ldns_buffer_write_u8_at() writes the given byte of data at the given position in the buffer
              buffer: the buffer
              at: the position in the buffer
              data: the 8 bits to write

       ldns_buffer_write_u8() writes the given byte of data at the current position in the buffer
              buffer: the buffer
              data: the 8 bits to write

       ldns_buffer_write_u16_at() writes the given 2 byte integer at the given position in the buffer
              buffer: the buffer
              at: the position in the buffer
              data: the 16 bits to write

       ldns_buffer_write_u16() writes the given 2 byte integer at the current position in the buffer
              buffer: the buffer
              data: the 16 bits to write

       ldns_buffer_read_at() copies count bytes of data at the given position to the given data-array
              buffer: the buffer
              at: the position in the buffer to start
              data: buffer to copy to
              count: the length of the data to copy

       ldns_buffer_read() copies count bytes of data at the current position to the given data-array
              buffer: the buffer
              data: buffer to copy to
              count: the length of the data to copy

       ldns_buffer_read_u8_at() returns the byte value at the given position in the buffer
              buffer: the buffer
              at: the position in the buffer
              Returns 1 byte integer

       ldns_buffer_read_u8() returns the byte value at the current position in the buffer
              buffer: the buffer
              Returns 1 byte integer

       ldns_buffer_read_u16_at() returns the 2-byte integer value at the given position in the buffer
              buffer: the buffer
              at: position in the buffer
              Returns 2 byte integer

       ldns_buffer_read_u16() returns the 2-byte integer value at the current position in the buffer
              buffer: the buffer
              Returns 2 byte integer

       ldns_buffer_read_u32_at() returns the 4-byte integer value at the given position in the buffer
              buffer: the buffer
              at: position in the buffer
              Returns 4 byte integer

       ldns_buffer_read_u32() returns the 4-byte integer value at the current position in the buffer
              buffer: the buffer
              Returns 4 byte integer

       ldns_buffer_write_u32() writes the given 4 byte integer at the current position in the buffer
              buffer: the buffer
              data: the 32 bits to write

       ldns_buffer_write_u32_at() writes the given 4 byte integer at the given position in the buffer
              buffer: the buffer
              at: the position in the buffer
