NAME
       gnutls_cipher_suite_get_name - API function

SYNOPSIS
       #include <gnutls/gnutls.h>

       const char * gnutls_cipher_suite_get_name(gnutls_kx_algorithm_t       kx_algorithm, gnutls_cipher_algorithm_t       cipher_algorithm, gnutls_mac_algorithm_t mac_algorithm);

ARGUMENTS
       gnutls_kx_algorithm_t       kx_algorithm
                   is a Key exchange algorithm

       gnutls_cipher_algorithm_t       cipher_algorithm
                   is a cipher algorithm

       gnutls_mac_algorithm_t mac_algorithm
                   is a MAC algorithm

DESCRIPTION
       This  function  returns the ciphersuite name under TLS1.2 or earlier versions when provided with individual algorithms. The full cipher suite name must be prepended by TLS or SSL depending of the
       protocol in use.

       To get a description of the current ciphersuite across versions, it is recommended to use gnutls_session_get_desc().

RETURNS
       a string that contains the name of a TLS cipher suite, specified by the given algorithms, or NULL.
