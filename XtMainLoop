NAME
       XtNextEvent, XtPending, XtPeekEvent, XtProcessEvent, XtMainLoop - query and process events and input

SYNTAX
       #include <X11/Intrinsic.h>

       void XtNextEvent(XEvent *event_return);

       Boolean XtPeekEvent(XEvent *event_return);

       Boolean XtPending(void);

       void XtProcessEvent(XtInputMask mask);

       void XtMainLoop(void);

ARGUMENTS
       event     Specifies a pointer to the event structure that is to be dispatched to the appropriate event handler.

       event_return
                 Returns the event information to the specified event structure.

       mask      Specifies what types of events to process.  The mask is the bitwise inclusive OR of any combination of XtIMXEvent, XtIMTimer, XtIMAlternateInput, and XtIMSignal.  As a convenience, the
                 X Toolkit defines the symbolic name XtIMAll to be the bitwise inclusive OR of all event types.

DESCRIPTION
       XtNextEvent has been replaced by XtAppNextEvent.

       XtPeekEvent has been replaced by XtAppPeekEvent.

       XtPending has been replaced by XtAppPending.

       XtProcessEvent has been replaced by XtAppProcessEvent.

       XtMainLoop has been replaced by XtAppMainLoop.
