SYNOPSIS
       #include <ares.h>

       int ares_set_sortlist(ares_channel channel, const char *sortstr)

DESCRIPTION
       The  ares_set_sortlist(3) function initializes an address sortlist configuration for the channel data identified by channel, so that addresses returned by ares_gethostbyname(3) are sorted accord‚Äê
       ing to the sortlist.  The provided sortstr string that holds a space separated list of IP-address-netmask pairs.  The netmask is optional but follows the address after a slash  if  present.   For
       example, "130.155.160.0/255.255.240.0 130.155.0.0".

       This function replaces any potentially previously configured address sortlist with the ones given in the configuration string.
