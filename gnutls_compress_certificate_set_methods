NAME
       gnutls_compress_certificate_set_methods - API function

SYNOPSIS
       #include <gnutls/gnutls.h>

       int gnutls_compress_certificate_set_methods(gnutls_session_t session, const gnutls_compression_method_t *      methods, size_t methods_len);

ARGUMENTS
       gnutls_session_t session
                   is a gnutls_session_t type.

       const gnutls_compression_method_t *      methods
                   is a list of supported compression methods.

       size_t methods_len
                   number of compression methods in  methods

DESCRIPTION
       This function sets the supported compression methods for certificate compression for the given session. The list of supported compression methods will be used for a) requesting the compression of
       peer's certificate and b) selecting the method to compress the local certificate before sending it to the peer.  The order of compression methods inside the list does matter as  the  method  that
       appears  earlier  in the list will be preferred before the later ones.  Note that even if you set the list of supported compression methods, the compression might not be used if the peer does not
       support any of your chosen compression methods.

       The list of supported compression methods must meet the following criteria: Argument  methods must be an array of valid compression methods of type  gnutls_compression_method_t.  Argument   meth‐
       ods_len  must contain the number of compression methods stored in the  methods array and must be within range <1, 127>.  The length constraints are defined by MIN_COMPRESS_CERTIFICATE_METHODS and
       MAX_COMPRESS_CERTIFICATE_METHODS macros located in the header file compress_certificate.h.

       If either  methods or  methods_len is equal to 0, current list of supported compression methods will be unset.

RETURNS
       GNUTLS_E_SUCCESS on success, otherwise a negative error code.

       Since 3.7.4
