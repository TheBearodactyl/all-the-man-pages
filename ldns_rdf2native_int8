DESCRIPTION
       ldns_native2rdf_int8() returns the rdf containing the native uint8_t repr.
              type: the ldns_rdf type to use
              value: the uint8_t to use
              Returns ldns_rdf* with the converted value

       ldns_native2rdf_int16() returns the rdf containing the native uint16_t representation.
              type: the ldns_rdf type to use
              value: the uint16_t to use
              Returns ldns_rdf* with the converted value

       ldns_native2rdf_int32() returns an rdf that contains the given int32 value.

              Because multiple rdf types can contain an int32, the type must be specified
              type: the ldns_rdf type to use
              value: the uint32_t to use
              Returns ldns_rdf* with the converted value

       ldns_native2rdf_int16_data() returns an int16_data rdf that contains the data in the given array, preceded by an int16 specifying the length.

              The memory is copied, and an LDNS_RDF_TYPE_INT16DATA is returned
              size: the size of the data
              *data: pointer to the actual data

              Returns ldns_rd* the rdf with the data

       ldns_rdf2native_int8() returns the native uint8_t representation from the rdf.
              rd: the ldns_rdf to operate on
              Returns uint8_t the value extracted

       ldns_rdf2native_int16() returns the native uint16_t representation from the rdf.
              rd: the ldns_rdf to operate on
              Returns uint16_t the value extracted

       ldns_rdf2native_int32() returns the native uint32_t representation from the rdf.
              rd: the ldns_rdf to operate on
              Returns uint32_t the value extracted

       ldns_rdf2native_sockaddr_storage()

       ldns_rdf2native_time_t() returns the native time_t representation from the rdf.
              rd: the ldns_rdf to operate on
              Returns time_t the value extracted (32 bits currently)
