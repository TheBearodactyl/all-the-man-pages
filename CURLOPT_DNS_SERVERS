NAME
       CURLOPT_DNS_SERVERS - DNS servers to use

SYNOPSIS
       #include <curl/curl.h>

       CURLcode curl_easy_setopt(CURL *handle, CURLOPT_DNS_SERVERS, char *servers);

DESCRIPTION
       Pass a char * that is the list of DNS servers to be used instead of the system default. The format of the dns servers option is:

       host[:port][,host[:port]]...

       For example:

       192.168.1.100,192.168.1.101,3.4.5.6

       The application does not have to keep the string around after setting this option.

DEFAULT
       NULL - use system default

PROTOCOLS
       All

EXAMPLE
       CURL *curl = curl_easy_init();
       if(curl) {
         curl_easy_setopt(curl, CURLOPT_URL, "https://example.com/foo.bin");
         curl_easy_setopt(curl, CURLOPT_DNS_SERVERS, "192.168.1.100:53,192.168.1.101");
         ret = curl_easy_perform(curl);
         curl_easy_cleanup(curl);
       }

AVAILABILITY
       This option requires that libcurl was built with a resolver backend that supports this operation. The c-ares backend is the only such one.

       Added in 7.24.0

RETURN VALUE
       Returns  CURLE_OK  if  the  option  is supported, CURLE_UNKNOWN_OPTION if not, CURLE_NOT_BUILT_IN if support was disabled at compile-time, CURLE_BAD_FUNCTION_ARGUMENT when given an invalid server
       list, or CURLE_OUT_OF_MEMORY if there was insufficient heap space.
