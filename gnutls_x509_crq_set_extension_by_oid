NAME
       gnutls_x509_crq_set_extension_by_oid - API function

SYNOPSIS
       #include <gnutls/x509.h>

       int gnutls_x509_crq_set_extension_by_oid(gnutls_x509_crq_t crq, const char * oid, const void * buf, size_t sizeof_buf, unsigned int critical);

ARGUMENTS
       gnutls_x509_crq_t crq
                   a certificate of type gnutls_x509_crq_t

                   holds an Object Identifier in null terminated string

       const void * buf
                   a pointer to a DER encoded data

       size_t sizeof_buf
                   holds the size of  buf

       unsigned int critical
                   should be non-zero if the extension is to be marked as critical
