NAME
       CURLOPT_FTPPORT - make FTP transfer active

SYNOPSIS
       #include <curl/curl.h>

       CURLcode curl_easy_setopt(CURL *handle, CURLOPT_FTPPORT, char *spec);

DESCRIPTION
       Pass  a  pointer to a null-terminated string as parameter. It specifies that the FTP transfer will be made actively and the given string will be used to get the IP address to use for the FTP PORT
       instruction.

       The PORT instruction tells the remote server to connect to our specified IP address. The string may be a plain IP address, a host name, a network interface name (under Unix) or just a '-'  symbol
       to let the library use your system's default IP address. Default FTP operations are passive, and thus will not use PORT.

       The address can be followed by a ':' to specify a port, optionally followed by a '-' to specify a port range. If the port specified is 0, the operating system will pick a free port. If a range is
       provided and all ports in the range are not available, libcurl will report CURLE_FTP_PORT_FAILED for the handle. Invalid port/range settings are ignored. IPv6 addresses followed by a port or port
       range have to be in brackets. IPv6 addresses without port/range specifier can be in brackets.

       Examples with specified ports:

         eth0:0
         192.168.1.2:32000-33000
         curl.se:32123
         [::1]:1234-4567

       We  strongly  advise  against specifying the address with a name, as it causes libcurl to do a blocking name resolve call to retrieve the IP address. That name resolve operation will not use DNS-
       over-HTTPS even if CURLOPT_DOH_URL(3) is set.

       You disable PORT again and go back to using the passive version by setting this option to NULL.

       The application does not have to keep the string around after setting this option.

DEFAULT
       NULL

PROTOCOLS
       FTP

EXAMPLE
       CURL *curl = curl_easy_init();
       if(curl) {
         curl_easy_setopt(curl, CURLOPT_URL, "ftp://example.com/old-server/file.txt");
         curl_easy_setopt(curl, CURLOPT_FTPPORT, "-");
         ret = curl_easy_perform(curl);
         curl_easy_cleanup(curl);
       }

AVAILABILITY
       Port range support was added in 7.19.5

RETURN VALUE
       Returns CURLE_OK if the option is supported, CURLE_UNKNOWN_OPTION if not, or CURLE_OUT_OF_MEMORY if there was insufficient heap space.
