NAME
       gnutls_x509_crt_get_key_purpose_oid - API function

SYNOPSIS
       #include <gnutls/x509.h>

       int gnutls_x509_crt_get_key_purpose_oid(gnutls_x509_crt_t cert, unsigned indx, void * oid, size_t * oid_size, unsigned int * critical);

ARGUMENTS
       gnutls_x509_crt_t cert
                   should contain a gnutls_x509_crt_t type

       unsigned indx
                   This specifies which OID to return. Use (0) to get the first one.

       void * oid  a pointer to a buffer to hold the OID (may be null)

       size_t * oid_size
                   initially holds the size of  oid

       unsigned int * critical
                   output flag to indicate criticality of extension

DESCRIPTION
       This  function will extract the key purpose OIDs of the Certificate specified by the given index.  These are stored in the Extended Key Usage extension (2.5.29.37) See the GNUTLS_KP_* definitions
       for human readable names.

       If  oid is null then only the size will be filled. The  oid returned will be null terminated, although  oid_size will not account for the trailing null.

RETURNS
       GNUTLS_E_SHORT_MEMORY_BUFFER if the provided buffer is not long enough, and in that case the *oid_size will be updated with the required size.  On success 0 is returned.
