NAME
       libssh2_channel_process_startup - request a shell on a channel

SYNOPSIS
       #include <libssh2.h>

       int libssh2_channel_process_startup(LIBSSH2_CHANNEL *channel,
                                           const char *request,
                                           unsigned int request_len,
                                           const char *message,
                                           unsigned int message_len);

DESCRIPTION
       channel - Active session channel instance.

       request - Type of process to startup. The SSH2 protocol currently defines shell, exec, and subsystem as standard process services.

       request_len - Length of request parameter.

       message - Request specific message data to include.

       message_len - Length of message parameter.

       Initiate a request on a session type channel such as returned by libssh2_channel_open_ex(3)

RETURN VALUE
       Return 0 on success or negative on failure.  It returns LIBSSH2_ERROR_EAGAIN when it would otherwise block. While LIBSSH2_ERROR_EAGAIN is a negative number, it isn't really a failure per se.

ERRORS
       LIBSSH2_ERROR_ALLOC -  An internal memory allocation call failed.

       LIBSSH2_ERROR_SOCKET_SEND - Unable to send data on socket.

       LIBSSH2_ERROR_CHANNEL_REQUEST_DENIED -
