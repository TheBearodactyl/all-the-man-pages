NAME
       memcmp - compare memory areas

LIBRARY
       Standard C library (libc, -lc)

SYNOPSIS
       #include <string.h>

       int memcmp(const void s1[.n], const void s2[.n], size_t n);

DESCRIPTION
       The memcmp() function compares the first n bytes (each interpreted as unsigned char) of the memory areas s1 and s2.

RETURN VALUE
       The  memcmp()  function  returns  an integer less than, equal to, or greater than zero if the first n bytes of s1 is found, respectively, to be less than, to match, or be greater than the first n
       bytes of s2.

       For a nonzero return value, the sign is determined by the sign of the difference between the first pair of bytes (interpreted as unsigned char) that differ in s1 and s2.

       If n is zero, the return value is zero.

HISTORY
       POSIX.1-2001, C89, SVr4, 4.3BSD.

CAVEATS
       Do not use memcmp() to compare security critical data, such as cryptographic secrets, because the required CPU time depends on the number of equal bytes.  Instead, a function that  performs  com‐
       parisons  in  constant time is required.  Some operating systems provide such a function (e.g., NetBSD's consttime_memequal()), but no such function is specified in POSIX.  On Linux, you may need
       to implement such a function yourself.

NAME
       memcmp — compare bytes in memory

SYNOPSIS
       #include <string.h>

       int memcmp(const void *s1, const void *s2, size_t n);

DESCRIPTION
       The functionality described on this reference page is aligned with the ISO C standard. Any conflict between the requirements described here and the ISO C standard is unintentional. This volume of
       POSIX.1‐2017 defers to the ISO C standard.

       The memcmp() function shall compare the first n bytes (each interpreted as unsigned char) of the object pointed to by s1 to the first n bytes of the object pointed to by s2.

       The sign of a non-zero return value shall be determined by the sign of the difference between the values of the first pair of bytes (both interpreted as type unsigned char) that differ in the ob‐
       jects being compared.

RETURN VALUE
       The memcmp() function shall return an integer greater than, equal to, or less than 0, if the object pointed to by s1 is greater than, equal to, or less than the object pointed to by  s2,  respec‐
       tively.

ERRORS
       No errors are defined.
