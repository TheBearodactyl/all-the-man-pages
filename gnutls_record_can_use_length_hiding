NAME
       gnutls_record_can_use_length_hiding - API function

SYNOPSIS
       #include <gnutls/gnutls.h>

       unsigned gnutls_record_can_use_length_hiding(gnutls_session_t session);

ARGUMENTS
       gnutls_session_t session
                   is a gnutls_session_t type.

DESCRIPTION
       If the session supports length-hiding padding, you can invoke gnutls_record_send_range() to send a message whose length is hidden in the given range. If the session does not support length hiding
       padding, you can use the standard gnutls_record_send() function, or gnutls_record_send_range() making sure that the range is the same as the length of the message you are trying to send.

RETURNS
       true (1) if the current session supports length-hiding padding, false (0) if the current session does not.
