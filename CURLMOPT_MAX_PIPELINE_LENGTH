NAME
       CURLMOPT_MAX_PIPELINE_LENGTH - maximum number of requests in a pipeline

SYNOPSIS
       #include <curl/curl.h>

       CURLMcode curl_multi_setopt(CURLM *handle, CURLMOPT_MAX_PIPELINE_LENGTH,
                                   long max);

DESCRIPTION
       No function since pipelining was removed in 7.62.0.

       Pass a long. The set max number will be used as the maximum amount of outstanding requests in an HTTP/1.1 pipeline. This option is only used for HTTP/1.1 pipelining, not for HTTP/2 multiplexing.

       When  this  limit  is reached, libcurl will use another connection to the same host (see CURLMOPT_MAX_HOST_CONNECTIONS(3)), or queue the request until one of the pipelines to the host is ready to
       accept a request.  Thus, the total number of requests in-flight is CURLMOPT_MAX_HOST_CONNECTIONS(3) * CURLMOPT_MAX_PIPELINE_LENGTH(3).

DEFAULT
       5

PROTOCOLS
       HTTP(S)

EXAMPLE
       CURLM *m = curl_multi_init();
       /* set a more conservative pipe length */
       curl_multi_setopt(m, CURLMOPT_MAX_PIPELINE_LENGTH, 3L);

AVAILABILITY
       Added in 7.30.0

RETURN VALUE
       Returns CURLM_OK if the option is supported, and CURLM_UNKNOWN_OPTION if not.
