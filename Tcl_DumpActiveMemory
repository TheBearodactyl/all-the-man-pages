NAME
       Tcl_DumpActiveMemory, Tcl_InitMemory, Tcl_ValidateAllMemory - Validated memory allocation interface

SYNOPSIS
       #include <tcl.h>

       int
       Tcl_DumpActiveMemory(fileName)

       void
       Tcl_InitMemory(interp)

       void
       Tcl_ValidateAllMemory(fileName, line)

ARGUMENTS
       Tcl_Interp *interp (in)            Tcl interpreter in which to add commands.

       const char *fileName (in)          For  Tcl_DumpActiveMemory, name of the file to which memory information will be written.  For Tcl_ValidateAllMemory, name of the file from which the call is be‐
                                          ing made (normally __FILE__).

       int line (in)                      Line number at which the call to Tcl_ValidateAllMemory is made (normally __LINE__).

DESCRIPTION
       These functions provide access to Tcl memory debugging information.  They are only functional when Tcl has been compiled with TCL_MEM_DEBUG defined at compile-time.  When TCL_MEM_DEBUG is not de‐
       fined, these functions are all no-ops.

       Tcl_DumpActiveMemory will output a list of all currently allocated memory to the specified file.  The information output for each allocated block of memory is:  starting and ending addresses (ex‐
       cluding guard zone), size, source file where ckalloc was called to allocate the block and line number in that file.  It is especially useful to call Tcl_DumpActiveMemory after the Tcl interpreter
       has been deleted.

       Tcl_InitMemory adds the Tcl memory command to the interpreter given by interp.  Tcl_InitMemory is called by Tcl_Main.

       Tcl_ValidateAllMemory forces a validation of the guard zones of all currently allocated blocks of memory.  Normally validation of a block occurs when its freed, unless full validation is enabled,
       in which case validation of all blocks occurs when ckalloc and ckfree are called.  This function forces the validation to occur at any point.
