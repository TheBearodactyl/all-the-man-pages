pthread_spin_lock(3)       Library Functions Manual       pthread_spin_lock(3)

NAME
       pthread_spin_lock, pthread_spin_trylock, pthread_spin_unlock - lock and
       unlock a spin lock

LIBRARY
       POSIX threads library (libpthread, -lpthread)

SYNOPSIS
       #include <pthread.h>

       int pthread_spin_lock(pthread_spinlock_t *lock);
       int pthread_spin_trylock(pthread_spinlock_t *lock);
       int pthread_spin_unlock(pthread_spinlock_t *lock);

           _POSIX_C_SOURCE >= 200112L

DESCRIPTION
       The pthread_spin_lock() function locks the spin  lock  referred  to  by
       lock.   If  the spin lock is currently unlocked, the calling thread ac‐
       quires the lock immediately.  If the spin lock is currently  locked  by
       another thread, the calling thread spins, testing the lock until it be‐
       comes available, at which point the calling thread acquires the lock.

       Calling pthread_spin_lock() on a lock  that  is  already  held  by  the
       caller    or    a   lock   that   has   not   been   initialized   with
       pthread_spin_init(3) results in undefined behavior.

       The pthread_spin_trylock() function is like pthread_spin_lock(), except
       that  if  the  spin lock referred to by lock is currently locked, then,
       instead of spinning, the call returns immediately with the error EBUSY.

       The pthread_spin_unlock() function unlocks the spin  lock  referred  to
       lock.   If  any  threads are spinning on the lock, one of those threads
       will then acquire the lock.

       Calling pthread_spin_unlock() on a lock that is not held by the  caller
       results in undefined behavior.

RETURN VALUE
       On  success,  these  functions return zero.  On failure, they return an
       error number.

ERRORS
       pthread_spin_lock() may fail with the following errors:

       EDEADLOCK
              The system detected a deadlock condition.

       pthread_spin_trylock() fails with the following errors:

       EBUSY  The spin lock is currently locked by another thread.

STANDARDS
       POSIX.1-2008.

HISTORY
       glibc 2.2.  POSIX.1-2001.

CAVEATS
       Applying any of the functions described on this page to  an  uninitial‐
       ized spin lock results in undefined behavior.

PROLOG
       This  manual  page is part of the POSIX Programmer's Manual.  The Linux
       implementation of this interface may differ (consult the  corresponding
       Linux  manual page for details of Linux behavior), or the interface may
       not be implemented on Linux.

NAME
       pthread_spin_lock, pthread_spin_trylock — lock a spin lock object

SYNOPSIS
       #include <pthread.h>

       int pthread_spin_lock(pthread_spinlock_t *lock);
       int pthread_spin_trylock(pthread_spinlock_t *lock);

DESCRIPTION
       The pthread_spin_lock() function shall lock the spin lock referenced by
       lock.   The  calling thread shall acquire the lock if it is not held by
       another thread. Otherwise, the thread shall spin (that  is,  shall  not
       return from the pthread_spin_lock() call) until the lock becomes avail‐
       able. The results are undefined if the calling thread holds the lock at
       the  time  the  call is made. The pthread_spin_trylock() function shall
       lock the spin lock referenced by lock if it is not held by any  thread.
       Otherwise, the function shall fail.

       The  results  are undefined if any of these functions is called with an
       uninitialized spin lock.

RETURN VALUE
       Upon successful completion, these functions shall return  zero;  other‐
       wise, an error number shall be returned to indicate the error.

ERRORS
       The pthread_spin_lock() function may fail if:

       EDEADLK
              A deadlock condition was detected.

       The pthread_spin_trylock() function shall fail if:

       EBUSY  A thread currently holds the lock.

       These functions shall not return an error code of [EINTR].

       The following sections are informative.

EXAMPLES
       None.

APPLICATION USAGE
       Applications  using this function may be subject to priority inversion,
       as discussed in the Base Definitions volume  of  POSIX.1‐2017,  Section
       3.291, Priority Inversion.

RATIONALE
       If an implementation detects that the value specified by the lock argu‐
       ment to pthread_spin_lock() or pthread_spin_trylock() does not refer to
       an  initialized  spin  lock object, it is recommended that the function
       should fail and report an [EINVAL] error.

       If an implementation detects that the value specified by the lock argu‐
       ment  to pthread_spin_lock() refers to a spin lock object for which the
       calling thread already holds the lock, it is recommended that the func‐
       tion should fail and report an [EDEADLK] error.

FUTURE DIRECTIONS
       None.
