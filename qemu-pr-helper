NAME
       qemu-pr-helper - QEMU persistent reservation helper

SYNOPSIS
       qemu-pr-helper [OPTION]

DESCRIPTION
       Implements the persistent reservation helper for QEMU.

       SCSI  persistent reservations allow restricting access to block devices
       to specific initiators in a shared storage  setup.   When  implementing
       clustering  of virtual machines, it is a common requirement for virtual
       machines to send persistent reservation SCSI  commands.   However,  the
       operating  system restricts sending these commands to unprivileged pro‐
       grams because incorrect usage can  disrupt  regular  operation  of  the
       storage   fabric.   QEMU's  SCSI  passthrough  devices  scsi-block  and
       scsi-generic support passing guest persistent reservation requests to a
       privileged  external  helper  program.  qemu-pr-helper is that external
       helper; it creates a listener socket which will accept incoming connec‐
       tions for communication with QEMU.

       If  you  want  to  run  VMs in a setup like this, this helper should be
       started as a system service, and you should read the QEMU  manual  sec‐
       tion  on "persistent reservation managers" to find out how to configure
       QEMU to connect to the socket created by qemu-pr-helper.

       After connecting to the socket, qemu-pr-helper can optionally drop root
       privileges, except for those capabilities that are needed for its oper‐
       ation.

       qemu-pr-helper can also use the systemd socket activation protocol.  In
       this case, the systemd socket unit should specify a Unix stream socket,
       like this:

          [Socket]
          ListenStream=/var/run/qemu-pr-helper.sock

OPTIONS
       -d, --daemon
              run in the background (and create a PID file)

       -q, --quiet
              decrease verbosity

       -v, --verbose
              increase verbosity

       -f, --pidfile=PATH
              PID file when running as a daemon. By default the  PID  file  is
              created  in  the  system  runtime  state  directory, for example
              /var/run/qemu-pr-helper.pid.

       -k, --socket=PATH
              path to the socket. By default the socket is created in the sys‐
              tem      runtime      state      directory,      for     example
              /var/run/qemu-pr-helper.sock.

       -T, --trace [[enable=]PATTERN][,events=FILE][,file=FILE]
              Specify tracing options.

              [enable=]PATTERN
                 Immediately enable events matching PATTERN (either event name
                 or  a  globbing  pattern).   This option is only available if
                 QEMU has been compiled with the simple, log or ftrace tracing
                 backend.  To specify multiple events or patterns, specify the
                 -trace option multiple times.

                 Use -trace help to print a list of names of trace points.

              events=FILE
                 Immediately enable events listed in FILE.  The file must con‐
                 tain  one event name (as listed in the trace-events-all file)
                 per line; globbing patterns are accepted too.  This option is
                 only available if QEMU has been compiled with the simple, log
                 or ftrace tracing backend.

              file=FILE
                 Log output traces to FILE.  This option is only available  if
                 QEMU has been compiled with the simple tracing backend.

       -u, --user=USER
              user to drop privileges to

       -g, --group=GROUP
              group to drop privileges to

       -h, --help
              Display a help message and exit.

       -V, --version
              Display version information and exit.
