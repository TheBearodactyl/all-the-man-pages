NAME
       gnutls_certificate_set_rawpk_key_mem - API function

SYNOPSIS
       #include <gnutls/gnutls.h>

       int gnutls_certificate_set_rawpk_key_mem(gnutls_certificate_credentials_t cred, const gnutls_datum_t * spki, const gnutls_datum_t * pkey, gnutls_x509_crt_fmt_t format, const char * pass, unsigned
       int key_usage, const char ** names, unsigned int names_length, unsigned int flags);

ARGUMENTS
       gnutls_certificate_credentials_t cred
                   is a gnutls_certificate_credentials_t type.

       const gnutls_datum_t * spki
                   contains a raw public key in PKIX.SubjectPublicKeyInfo format.

       const gnutls_datum_t * pkey
                   contains a raw private key.

       gnutls_x509_crt_fmt_t format
                   encoding of the keys. DER or PEM.

       const char * pass
                   an optional password to unlock the private key pkey.

       unsigned int key_usage
                   An ORed sequence of GNUTLS_KEY_* flags.

       const char ** names
                   is an array of DNS names belonging to the public-key (NULL if none).

       unsigned int names_length
                   holds the length of the names list.

       unsigned int flags
                   an ORed sequence of gnutls_pkcs_encrypt_flags_t.  These apply to the private key pkey.

DESCRIPTION
       This function sets a public/private keypair in the gnutls_certificate_credentials_t type to be used for authentication and/or encryption.  spki and  privkey should match otherwise set  signatures
       cannot be validated. In case of no match this function returns GNUTLS_E_CERTIFICATE_KEY_MISMATCH. This function should be called once for the client because there is currently no mechanism to de‐
       termine which raw public-key to select for the peer when there are multiple present. Multiple raw public keys for the server can be distinghuished by setting the  names .

       Note here that  spki is a raw public-key as defined in RFC7250. It means that there is no surrounding certificate that holds the public key and that there is  therefore  no  direct  mechanism  to
       prove the authenticity of this key. The keypair can be used during a TLS handshake but its authenticity should be established via a different mechanism (e.g. TOFU or known fingerprint).

       The supported formats are basic unencrypted key, PKCS8, PKCS12, and the openssl format and will be autodetected.

       If the raw public-key and the private key are given in PEM encoding then the strings that hold their values must be null terminated.

       Key  usage  (as  defined  by  X.509  extension  (2.5.29.15))  can  be  explicitly  set  because  there  is  no  certificate  structure  around  the  key  to  define  this value. See for more info
       gnutls_x509_crt_get_key_usage().

       Note that, this function by default returns zero on success and a negative value on error. Since 3.5.6, when the flag GNUTLS_CERTIFICATE_API_V2 is set using gnutls_certificate_set_flags() it  re‐
       turns an index (greater or equal to zero). That index can be used in other functions to refer to the added key-pair.

RETURNS
       On  success,  GNUTLS_E_SUCCESS  (0) is returned, in case the key pair does not match GNUTLS_E_CERTIFICATE_KEY_MISMATCH is returned, in other erroneous cases a different negative error code is re‐
       turned.

SINCE
       3.6.6
