NAME
       EVP_blake2b512, EVP_blake2s256 - BLAKE2 For EVP

SYNOPSIS
        #include <openssl/evp.h>

        const EVP_MD *EVP_blake2b512(void);
        const EVP_MD *EVP_blake2s256(void);

DESCRIPTION
       BLAKE2 is an improved version of BLAKE, which was submitted to the NIST SHA-3 algorithm competition. The BLAKE2s and BLAKE2b algorithms are described in RFC 7693.

       EVP_blake2s256()
           The BLAKE2s algorithm that produces a 256-bit output from a given input.

       EVP_blake2b512()
           The BLAKE2b algorithm that produces a 512-bit output from a given input.

RETURN VALUES
       These functions return a EVP_MD structure that contains the implementation of the message digest. See EVP_MD_meth_new(3) for details of the EVP_MD structure.

CONFORMING TO
       RFC 7693.

NOTES
       While the BLAKE2b and BLAKE2s algorithms supports a variable length digest, this implementation outputs a digest of a fixed length (the maximum length supported), which is 512-bits for BLAKE2b
       and 256-bits for BLAKE2s.
