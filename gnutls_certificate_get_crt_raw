NAME
       gnutls_certificate_get_crt_raw - API function

SYNOPSIS
       #include <gnutls/gnutls.h>

       int gnutls_certificate_get_crt_raw(gnutls_certificate_credentials_t sc, unsigned idx1, unsigned idx2, gnutls_datum_t * cert);

ARGUMENTS
       gnutls_certificate_credentials_t sc
                   is a gnutls_certificate_credentials_t type.

       unsigned idx1
                   the index of the certificate chain if multiple are present

       unsigned idx2
                   the index of the certificate in the chain. Zero gives the server's certificate.

       gnutls_datum_t * cert
                   Will hold the DER encoded certificate.

DESCRIPTION
       This  function will return the DER encoded certificate of the server or any other certificate on its certificate chain (based on  idx2 ).  The returned data should be treated as constant and only
       accessible during the lifetime of  sc . The  idx1 matches the value gnutls_certificate_set_x509_key() and friends functions.

RETURNS
       On success, GNUTLS_E_SUCCESS (0) is returned, otherwise a negative error value. In case the indexes are out of bounds GNUTLS_E_REQUESTED_DATA_NOT_AVAILABLE is returned.

SINCE
       3.2.5
