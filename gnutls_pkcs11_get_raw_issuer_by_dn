NAME
       gnutls_pkcs11_get_raw_issuer_by_dn - API function

SYNOPSIS
       #include <gnutls/pkcs11.h>

       int gnutls_pkcs11_get_raw_issuer_by_dn(const char * url, const gnutls_datum_t * dn, gnutls_datum_t * issuer, gnutls_x509_crt_fmt_t fmt, unsigned int flags);

ARGUMENTS
       const char * url
                   A PKCS 11 url identifying a token

       const gnutls_datum_t * dn
                   is the DN to search for

       gnutls_datum_t * issuer
                   Will hold the issuer if any in an allocated buffer.

       gnutls_x509_crt_fmt_t fmt
                   The format of the exported issuer.

       unsigned int flags

DESCRIPTION
       This  function  will  return  the  certificate  with  the  given DN, if it is stored in the token. By default only marked as trusted issuers are returned. If any issuer should be returned specify
       GNUTLS_PKCS11_OBJ_FLAG_RETRIEVE_ANY in  flags .

       The name of the function includes issuer because it can be used to discover issuers of certificates.
