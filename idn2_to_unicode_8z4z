NAME
       idn2_to_unicode_8z4z - API function

SYNOPSIS
       #include <idn2.h>

       int idn2_to_unicode_8z4z(const char * input, uint32_t ** output, G_GNUC_UNUSED int flags);

ARGUMENTS
       const char * input
                   Input zero-terminated UTF-8 string.

       uint32_t ** output
                   Newly allocated UTF-32/UCS-4 output string.

       G_GNUC_UNUSED int flags
                   Currently unused.

DESCRIPTION
       Converts a possibly ACE encoded domain name in UTF-8 format into a UTF-32 string (punycode decoding). The output buffer will be zero-terminated and must be deallocated by the caller.

        output may be NULL to test lookup of  input without allocating memory.

SINCE
       2.0.0
