PROLOG

       the interface may not be implemented on Linux.

NAME
       logname — return the user's login name

SYNOPSIS
       logname

DESCRIPTION
       The logname utility shall write the user's login name to standard output. The login name shall be the string that would be returned by the getlogin() function defined  in  the  System  Interfaces
       volume of POSIX.1‐2017. Under the conditions where the getlogin() function would fail, the logname utility shall write a diagnostic message to standard error and exit with a non-zero exit status.

OPTIONS
       None.

OPERANDS
       None.

STDIN
       Not used.

INPUT FILES
       None.

ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
       The following environment variables shall affect the execution of logname:

       LANG      Provide  a default value for the internationalization variables that are unset or null. (See the Base Definitions volume of POSIX.1‐2017, Section 8.2, Internationalization Variables for
                 the precedence of internationalization variables used to determine the values of locale categories.)

       LC_ALL    If set to a non-empty string value, override the values of all the other internationalization variables.

       LC_CTYPE  Determine the locale for the interpretation of sequences of bytes of text data as characters (for example, single-byte as opposed to multi-byte characters in arguments).

       LC_MESSAGES
                 Determine the locale that should be used to affect the format and contents of diagnostic messages written to standard error.

       NLSPATH   Determine the location of message catalogs for the processing of LC_MESSAGES.

ASYNCHRONOUS EVENTS
       Default.

STDOUT
       The logname utility output shall be a single line consisting of the user's login name:

           "%s\n", <login name>

STDERR
       The standard error shall be used only for diagnostic messages.

OUTPUT FILES
       None.

EXTENDED DESCRIPTION
       None.

EXIT STATUS
       The following exit values shall be returned:

        0    Successful completion.

       >0    An error occurred.

CONSEQUENCES OF ERRORS
       Default.

       The following sections are informative.

APPLICATION USAGE
       The logname utility explicitly ignores the LOGNAME environment variable because environment changes could produce erroneous results.

EXAMPLES
       None.

RATIONALE
       The passwd file is not listed as required because the implementation may have other means of mapping login names.

FUTURE DIRECTIONS
       None.
