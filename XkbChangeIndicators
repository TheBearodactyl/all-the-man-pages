NAME
       XkbChangeIndicators - Changes indicator maps or state without passing the entire keyboard description

SYNOPSIS
       Bool XkbChangeIndicators (Display *dpy, XkbDescPtr xkb, XkbIndicatorChangesPtr changes, unsigned int state);

ARGUMENTS
       dpy    connection to the X server

       xkb    keyboard description from which names are to be taken.

       changes
              indicators to be updated on the server

       state  new state of indicators listed in changes->state_changes

DESCRIPTION
       The XkbIndicatorChangesRec identifies small modifications to the indicator map.  Use it with the function XkbChangeIndicators to reduce the amount of traffic sent to the server (see STRUCTURES).

       The state_changes field is a mask that specifies the indicators that have changed state, and map_changes is a mask that specifies the indicators whose maps have changed.

       XkbChangeIndicators  copies  any  maps  specified  by  changes  from the keyboard description, xkb, to the server specified by dpy.  If any bits are set in the state_changes field of changes, Xk‐
       bChangeIndicators also sets the state of those indicators to the values specified in the state mask. A 1 bit in state turns the corresponding indicator on, a 0 bit turns it off.

       In addition, it can also generate XkbIndicatorStateNotify and XkbIndicatorMapNotify events.

       Whenever an indicator changes state, the server sends XkbIndicatorStateNotify events to all interested clients. Similarly, whenever an indicator's map changes, the server sends XkbIndicatorMapNo‐
       tify events to all interested clients.

       To receive XkbIndicatorStateNotify events, use XkbSelectEvents with both the bits_to_change and values_for_bits parameters containing XkbIndicatorStateNotifyMask. To receive XkbIndicatorMapNotify
       events, use XkbSelectEvents with XkbIndicatorMapNotifyMask.

       To receive events for only specific indicators, use XkbSelectEventDetails.  Set the event_type parameter to XkbIndicatorStateNotify or XkbIndicatorMapNotify, and set both the  bits_to_change  and
       values_for_bits detail parameters to a mask where each bit specifies one indicator, turning on those bits that specify the indicators for which you want to receive events.

       xkb_type is either XkbIndicatorStateNotify or XkbIndicatorMapNotify, depending on whether the event is a kbIndicatorStateNotify event or kbIndicatorMapNotify event.

       The  changed parameter is a mask that is the bitwise inclusive OR of the indicators that have changed. If the event is of type XkbIndicatorMapNotify, changed reports the maps that changed. If the
       event is of type XkbIndicatorStateNotify, changed reports the indicators that have changed state.  state is a mask that specifies the current state of all indicators, whether they have changed or
       not, for both XkbIndicatorStateNotify and IndicatorMapNotify events.

STRUCTURES
            typedef struct _XkbIndicatorChanges {
                unsigned int          state_changes;
                unsigned int           map_changes;
            }XkbIndicatorChangesRec,*XkbIndicatorChangesPtr;

       Both types of indicator events use the same structure:

           typedef struct _XkbIndicatorNotify {
               int            type;        /* Xkb extension base event code */
               unsigned long  serial;      /* X server serial number for event */
               Bool           send_event;  /* True => synthetically generated */
               Display *      display;     /* server connection where event generated */
               Time           time;        /* server time when event generated */
               int            xkb_type;    /* specifies state or map notify */
               int            device;      /* Xkb device ID, will not be XkbUseCoreKbd*/
               unsigned int   changed;     /* mask of indicators with new state or map */
               unsigned int   state;       /* current state of all indicators */
           } XkbIndicatorNotifyEvent;
