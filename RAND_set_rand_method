RAND_SET_RAND_METHOD(3ssl)          OpenSSL         RAND_SET_RAND_METHOD(3ssl)

NAME
       RAND_set_rand_method, RAND_get_rand_method, RAND_OpenSSL - select RAND
       method

SYNOPSIS
        #include <openssl/rand.h>

       The following functions have been deprecated since OpenSSL 3.0, and can
       be hidden entirely by defining OPENSSL_API_COMPAT with a suitable
       version value, see openssl_user_macros(7):

        RAND_METHOD *RAND_OpenSSL(void);

        int RAND_set_rand_method(const RAND_METHOD *meth);

        const RAND_METHOD *RAND_get_rand_method(void);

DESCRIPTION
       All of the functions described on this page are deprecated.
       Applications should instead use RAND_set_DRBG_type(3), EVP_RAND(3) and
       EVP_RAND(7).

       A RAND_METHOD specifies the functions that OpenSSL uses for random
       number generation.

       RAND_OpenSSL() returns the default RAND_METHOD implementation by
       OpenSSL.  This implementation ensures that the PRNG state is unique for
       each thread.

       If an ENGINE is loaded that provides the RAND API, however, it will be
       used instead of the method returned by RAND_OpenSSL().  This is
       deprecated in OpenSSL 3.0.

       RAND_set_rand_method() makes meth the method for PRNG use.  If an
       ENGINE was providing the method, it will be released first.

       RAND_get_rand_method() returns a pointer to the current RAND_METHOD.

THE RAND_METHOD STRUCTURE
        typedef struct rand_meth_st {
            int (*seed)(const void *buf, int num);
            int (*bytes)(unsigned char *buf, int num);
            void (*cleanup)(void);
            int (*add)(const void *buf, int num, double entropy);
            int (*pseudorand)(unsigned char *buf, int num);
            int (*status)(void);
        } RAND_METHOD;

       The fields point to functions that are used by, in order, RAND_seed(),
       RAND_bytes(), internal RAND cleanup, RAND_add(), RAND_pseudo_rand() and
       RAND_status().  Each pointer may be NULL if the function is not
       implemented.

RETURN VALUES
       RAND_set_rand_method() returns 1 on success and 0 on failure.
       RAND_get_rand_method() and RAND_OpenSSL() return pointers to the
       respective methods.

SEE ALSO
       EVP_RAND(3), RAND_set_DRBG_type(3), RAND_bytes(3), ENGINE_by_id(3),
       EVP_RAND(7), RAND(7)

HISTORY
       All of these functions were deprecated in OpenSSL 3.0.
