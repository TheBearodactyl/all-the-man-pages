SD_BUS_SET_CONNECTED_SIGNAsd_bus_set_connected_sSD_BUS_SET_CONNECTED_SIGNAL(3)

NAME
       sd_bus_set_connected_signal, sd_bus_get_connected_signal - Control
       emission of local connection establishment signal on bus connections

SYNOPSIS
       #include <systemd/sd-bus.h>

       int sd_bus_set_connected_signal(sd_bus *bus, int b);

       int sd_bus_get_connected_signal(sd_bus *bus);

DESCRIPTION
       sd_bus_set_connected_signal() may be used to control whether a local,
       synthetic Connected() signal message shall be generated and enqueued
       for dispatching when the connection is fully established. If the b
       parameter is zero the message is not generated (the default), otherwise
       it is generated.

       sd_bus_get_connected_signal() may be used to query whether this feature
       is enabled. It returns zero if not, positive otherwise.

       The Connected() signal message is generated from the
       "org.freedesktop.DBus.Local" service and interface, and
       "/org/freedesktop/DBus/Local" object path. Use
       sd_bus_match_signal_async(3) to match on this signal.

       This message is particularly useful on slow transports where
       connections take a long time to be established. This is especially the
       case when sd_bus_set_watch_bind(3) is used. The signal is generated
       when the sd_bus_is_ready(3) returns positive for the first time.

       The Connected() signal corresponds with the Disconnected() signal that
       is synthesized locally when the connection is terminated. The latter is
       generated unconditionally however, unlike the former which needs to be
       enabled explicitly before it is generated, with
       sd_bus_set_connected_signal().

RETURN VALUE
       On success, these functions return 0 or a positive integer. On failure,
       they return a negative errno-style error code.

   Errors
       Returned errors may indicate the following problems:

       -ECHILD
           The bus connection has been created in a different process.

NOTES
       These APIs are implemented as a shared library, which can be compiled
       and linked to with the libsystemd pkg-config(1) file.
