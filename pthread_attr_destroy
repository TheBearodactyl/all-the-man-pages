pthread_attr_init(3)       Library Functions Manual       pthread_attr_init(3)

NAME
       pthread_attr_init, pthread_attr_destroy - initialize and destroy thread
       attributes object

LIBRARY
       POSIX threads library (libpthread, -lpthread)

SYNOPSIS
       #include <pthread.h>

       int pthread_attr_init(pthread_attr_t *attr);
       int pthread_attr_destroy(pthread_attr_t *attr);

DESCRIPTION
       The pthread_attr_init() function initializes the thread attributes  ob‐
       ject  pointed  to  by  attr  with default attribute values.  After this
       call, individual attributes of the object can be set using various  re‐
       lated  functions  (listed  under  SEE ALSO), and then the object can be
       used in one or more pthread_create(3) calls that create threads.

       Calling pthread_attr_init() on a thread attributes object that has  al‐
       ready been initialized results in undefined behavior.

       When a thread attributes object is no longer required, it should be de‐
       stroyed using the pthread_attr_destroy() function.  Destroying a thread
       attributes object has no effect on threads that were created using that
       object.

       Once a thread attributes object has been destroyed, it  can  be  reini‐
       tialized  using  pthread_attr_init().   Any  other  use  of a destroyed
       thread attributes object has undefined results.

RETURN VALUE
       On success, these functions return 0; on error, they return  a  nonzero
       error number.

ERRORS
       POSIX.1  documents  an  ENOMEM  error for pthread_attr_init(); on Linux
       these functions always succeed (but portable and future-proof  applica‐
       tions should nevertheless handle a possible error return).

HISTORY
       POSIX.1-2001.

NOTES
       The pthread_attr_t type should be treated as opaque: any access to  the
       object  other  than  via pthreads functions is nonportable and produces
       undefined results.

EXAMPLES
       The program below optionally makes use of pthread_attr_init() and vari‐
       ous  related functions to initialize a thread attributes object that is
       used to create a single thread.  Once  created,  the  thread  uses  the
       pthread_getattr_np(3)  function  (a  nonstandard  GNU extension) to re‐
       trieve the thread's attributes, and then displays those attributes.

       If the program is run with no command-line  argument,  then  it  passes
       NULL  as  the attr argument of pthread_create(3), so that the thread is
       created with default attributes.  Running the program  on  Linux/x86-32
       with the NPTL threading implementation, we see the following:

           $ ulimit -s       # No stack limit ==> default stack size is 2 MB
           unlimited
           $ ./a.out
           Thread attributes:
                   Detach state        = PTHREAD_CREATE_JOINABLE
                   Scope               = PTHREAD_SCOPE_SYSTEM
                   Inherit scheduler   = PTHREAD_INHERIT_SCHED
                   Scheduling policy   = SCHED_OTHER
                   Scheduling priority = 0
                   Guard size          = 4096 bytes
                   Stack address       = 0x40196000
                   Stack size          = 0x201000 bytes

       When  we  supply  a  stack size as a command-line argument, the program
       initializes a thread attributes object, sets various attributes in that
       object,  and passes a pointer to the object in the call to pthread_cre‐
       ate(3).  Running the program on Linux/x86-32 with  the  NPTL  threading
       implementation, we see the following:

           $ ./a.out 0x3000000
           posix_memalign() allocated at 0x40197000
           Thread attributes:
                   Detach state        = PTHREAD_CREATE_DETACHED
                   Scope               = PTHREAD_SCOPE_SYSTEM
                   Inherit scheduler   = PTHREAD_EXPLICIT_SCHED
                   Scheduling policy   = SCHED_OTHER
                   Scheduling priority = 0
                   Guard size          = 0 bytes
                   Stack address       = 0x40197000
                   Stack size          = 0x3000000 bytes

       This  manual  page is part of the POSIX Programmer's Manual.  The Linux
       implementation of this interface may differ (consult the  corresponding
       Linux  manual page for details of Linux behavior), or the interface may

NAME
       pthread_attr_destroy, pthread_attr_init — destroy  and  initialize  the
       thread attributes object

SYNOPSIS
       #include <pthread.h>

       int pthread_attr_destroy(pthread_attr_t *attr);
       int pthread_attr_init(pthread_attr_t *attr);

DESCRIPTION
       The  pthread_attr_destroy()  function shall destroy a thread attributes
       object. An implementation may cause pthread_attr_destroy() to set  attr
       to an implementation-defined invalid value. A destroyed attr attributes
       object can be reinitialized using pthread_attr_init(); the  results  of
       otherwise  referencing the object after it has been destroyed are unde‐
       fined.

       The pthread_attr_init() function shall initialize a  thread  attributes
       object attr with the default value for all of the individual attributes
       used by a given implementation.

       The resulting attributes object (possibly modified by setting  individ‐
       ual  attribute  values)  when  used by pthread_create() defines the at‐
       tributes of the thread created. A single attributes object can be  used
       in  multiple simultaneous calls to pthread_create().  Results are unde‐
       fined if pthread_attr_init() is called specifying an  already  initial‐
       ized attr attributes object.

       The  behavior  is undefined if the value specified by the attr argument
       to pthread_attr_destroy() does not refer to an initialized  thread  at‐
       tributes object.

RETURN VALUE
       Upon      successful     completion,     pthread_attr_destroy()     and
       pthread_attr_init() shall return a value of 0; otherwise, an error num‐
       ber shall be returned to indicate the error.

ERRORS
       The pthread_attr_init() function shall fail if:

       ENOMEM Insufficient  memory  exists to initialize the thread attributes
              object.

       These functions shall not return an error code of [EINTR].

       The following sections are informative.

EXAMPLES

APPLICATION USAGE
       None.

RATIONALE
       Attributes objects are provided for  threads,  mutexes,  and  condition
       variables  as a mechanism to support probable future standardization in
       these areas without requiring that the function itself be changed.

       Attributes objects provide clean isolation of the configurable  aspects
       of  threads. For example, ``stack size'' is an important attribute of a
       thread, but it cannot be expressed portably. When  porting  a  threaded
       program,  stack  sizes often need to be adjusted. The use of attributes
       objects can help by allowing the changes to be  isolated  in  a  single
       place,  rather  than  being spread across every instance of thread cre‐
       ation.

       Attributes objects can be used to set up  ``classes'  of  threads  with
       similar  attributes;  for example, ``threads with large stacks and high
       priority'' or ``threads with minimal stacks''. These classes can be de‐
       fined in a single place and then referenced wherever threads need to be
       created. Changes to ``class'' decisions become straightforward, and de‐
       tailed analysis of each pthread_create() call is not required.

       The  attributes objects are defined as opaque types as an aid to exten‐
       sibility. If these objects had been specified as structures, adding new
       attributes  would  force  recompilation  of all multi-threaded programs
       when the attributes objects are extended; this might not be possible if
       different program components were supplied by different vendors.

       Additionally,  opaque  attributes objects present opportunities for im‐
       proving performance. Argument validity can be  checked  once  when  at‐
       tributes are set, rather than each time a thread is created.  Implemen‐
       tations often need to cache kernel objects that are expensive  to  cre‐
       ate. Opaque attributes objects provide an efficient mechanism to detect
       when cached objects become invalid due to attribute changes.

       Since assignment is not necessarily defined on a given opaque type, im‐
       plementation-defined  default  values  cannot  be defined in a portable
       way. The solution to this problem is to allow attributes objects to  be
       initialized  dynamically by attributes object initialization functions,
       so that default values can be supplied automatically by the implementa‐
       tion.

       The  following  proposal was provided as a suggested alternative to the
       supplied attributes:

        1. Maintain the style of passing a parameter formed by the bitwise-in‐
           clusive  OR  of  flags to the initialization routines (pthread_cre‐
           ate(), pthread_mutex_init(), pthread_cond_init()).   The  parameter
           containing the flags should be an opaque type for extensibility. If
           no flags are set in the parameter, then  the  objects  are  created
           with  default characteristics. An implementation may specify imple‐
           mentation-defined flag values and associated behavior.

        2. If further specialization of mutexes  and  condition  variables  is
           necessary,  implementations  may specify additional procedures that
           operate on the pthread_mutex_t and pthread_cond_t objects  (instead
           of on attributes objects).

       The difficulties with this solution are:

        1. A  bitmask  is not opaque if bits have to be set into bitvector at‐
           tributes objects using explicitly-coded bitwise-inclusive OR opera‐
           tions.  If  the set of options exceeds an int, application program‐
           mers need to know the location of each bit. If bits are set or read
           by encapsulation (that is, get and set functions), then the bitmask
           is merely an implementation of attributes objects as currently  de‐
           fined and should not be exposed to the programmer.

        2. Many  attributes are not Boolean or very small integral values. For
           example, scheduling policy may be placed in  3-bit  or  4-bit,  but
           priority  requires 5-bit or more, thereby taking up at least 8 bits
           out of a possible 16 bits on machines with 16-bit integers. Because
           of this, the bitmask can only reasonably control whether particular
           attributes are set or not, and it cannot serve as the repository of
           the value itself. The value needs to be specified as a function pa‐
           rameter (which is non-extensible), or by setting a structure  field
           (which is non-opaque), or by get and set functions (making the bit‐
           mask a redundant addition to the attributes objects).

       Stack size is defined as an optional attribute because the very  notion
       of  a  stack  is inherently machine-dependent. Some implementations may
       not be able to change the size of the stack, for  example,  and  others
       may not need to because stack pages may be discontiguous and can be al‐
       located and released on demand.

       The attribute mechanism has been designed in large measure for extensi‐
       bility.  Future  extensions  to  the  attribute mechanism or to any at‐
       tributes object defined in this volume of POSIX.1‐2017 has to  be  done
       with care so as not to affect binary-compatibility.

       Attributes  objects,  even  if allocated by means of dynamic allocation
       functions such as malloc(), may have their size fixed at compile  time.
       This  means,  for example, a pthread_create() in an implementation with
       extensions to pthread_attr_t cannot look beyond the area that  the  bi‐
       nary  application  assumes is valid. This suggests that implementations
       should maintain a size field in the attributes object, as well as  pos‐
       sibly  version information, if extensions in different directions (pos‐
       sibly by different vendors) are to be accommodated.

       If an implementation detects that the value specified by the attr argu‐
       ment  to pthread_attr_destroy() does not refer to an initialized thread
       attributes object, it is recommended that the function should fail  and
       report an [EINVAL] error.

       If an implementation detects that the value specified by the attr argu‐
       ment to pthread_attr_init() refers to an already initialized thread at‐
       tributes  object,  it  is recommended that the function should fail and
       report an [EBUSY] error.

FUTURE DIRECTIONS
       None.
