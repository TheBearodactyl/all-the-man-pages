NAME
       asn1_der_decoding_element - API function

SYNOPSIS
       #include <libtasn1.h>

       int asn1_der_decoding_element(asn1_node * structure, const char * elementName, const void * ider, int len, char * errorDescription);

ARGUMENTS
       asn1_node * structure
                   pointer to an ASN1 structure

       const char * elementName
                   name of the element to fill

       const void * ider
                   vector that contains the DER encoding of the whole structure.

       int len     number of bytes of *der: der[0]..der[len-1]

       char * errorDescription
                   null-terminated string contains details when an error occurred.

DESCRIPTION
       Fill the element named  ELEMENTNAME with values of a DER encoding string.  The structure must just be created with function asn1_create_element().  The DER vector must contain the encoding string
       of the whole  STRUCTURE .  If an error occurs during the decoding procedure, the * STRUCTURE is deleted and set equal to NULL.

       This function is deprecated and may just be an alias to asn1_der_decoding in future versions. Use asn1_der_decoding() instead.

RETURNS
       ASN1_SUCCESS if DER encoding OK, ASN1_ELEMENT_NOT_FOUND if ELEMENT is NULL or  elementName == NULL, and ASN1_TAG_ERROR or ASN1_DER_ERROR if the der encoding doesn't match the structure  structure
       (*ELEMENT deleted).
