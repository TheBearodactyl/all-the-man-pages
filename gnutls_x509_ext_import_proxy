NAME
       gnutls_x509_ext_import_proxy - API function

SYNOPSIS
       #include <gnutls/x509-ext.h>

       int gnutls_x509_ext_import_proxy(const gnutls_datum_t * ext, int * pathlen, char ** policyLanguage, char ** policy, size_t * sizeof_policy);

ARGUMENTS
       const gnutls_datum_t * ext
                   the DER encoded extension data

       int * pathlen
                   pointer  to output integer indicating path length (may be NULL), non-negative error codes indicate a present pCPathLenConstraint field and the actual value, -1 indicate that the field
                   is absent.

       char ** policyLanguage
                   output variable with OID of policy language

       char ** policy
                   output variable with policy data

       size_t * sizeof_policy
                   output variable with size of policy data

DESCRIPTION
       This function will return the information from a proxy certificate extension. It reads the ProxyCertInfo X.509 extension (1.3.6.1.5.5.7.1.14).  The  policyLanguage  and   policy  values  must  be
       deinitialized using gnutls_free() after use.

RETURNS
       On success, GNUTLS_E_SUCCESS (0) is returned, otherwise a negative error value.

SINCE
       3.3.0
