           uint8_t  response_type;
           uint8_t  is_param_recognized;
           uint16_t sequence;
           uint32_t length;

   Reply function
       xcb_dri2_get_param_reply_t *xcb_dri2_get_param_reply(xcb_connection_t *conn, xcb_dri2_get_param_cookie_t cookie, xcb_generic_error_t **e);

       length    The length of the reply, in words (a word is 4 bytes).

       is_param_recognized
                 TODO: NOT YET DOCUMENTED.

       value_hi  TODO: NOT YET DOCUMENTED.

       value_lo  TODO: NOT YET DOCUMENTED.

DESCRIPTION
RETURN VALUE
       Returns an xcb_dri2_get_param_cookie_t. Errors have to be handled when calling the reply function xcb_dri2_get_param_reply.

       If you want to handle errors in the event loop instead, use xcb_dri2_get_param_unchecked. See xcb-requests(3) for details.
