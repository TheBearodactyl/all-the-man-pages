NAME
       gnutls_x509_crt_list_import_url - API function

SYNOPSIS
       #include <gnutls/x509.h>

       int gnutls_x509_crt_list_import_url(gnutls_x509_crt_t ** certs, unsigned int * size, const char * url, gnutls_pin_callback_t pin_fn, void * pin_fn_userdata, unsigned int flags);

ARGUMENTS
       gnutls_x509_crt_t ** certs
                   Will hold the allocated certificate list.

       unsigned int * size
                   It will contain the size of the list.

       const char * url
                   A PKCS 11 url

       gnutls_pin_callback_t pin_fn
                   a PIN callback if not globally set

       void * pin_fn_userdata
                   parameter for the PIN callback

       unsigned int flags
                   One of GNUTLS_PKCS11_OBJ_* flags for PKCS11 URLs or zero otherwise

DESCRIPTION
       This  function  will  import  a  certificate  chain  present  in  a  PKCS11  token  or  any  type  of  back-end  that  supports  URLs.  The  certificates  must  be  deinitialized afterwards using
       gnutls_x509_crt_deinit() and the returned pointer must be freed using gnutls_free().

       The URI provided must be the first certificate in the chain; subsequent certificates will be retrieved using gnutls_pkcs11_get_raw_issuer() or equivalent functionality for the supported URI.

RETURNS
       On success, GNUTLS_E_SUCCESS (0) is returned, otherwise a negative error value.

SINCE
       3.6.3
