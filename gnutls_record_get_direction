NAME
       gnutls_record_get_direction - API function

SYNOPSIS
       #include <gnutls/gnutls.h>

       int gnutls_record_get_direction(gnutls_session_t session);

ARGUMENTS
       gnutls_session_t session
                   is a gnutls_session_t type.

DESCRIPTION
       This function is useful to determine whether a GnuTLS function was interrupted while sending or receiving, so that select() or poll() may be called appropriately.

       It  provides information about the internals of the record protocol and is only useful if a prior gnutls function call, e.g.  gnutls_handshake(), was interrupted and returned GNUTLS_E_INTERRUPTED
       or GNUTLS_E_AGAIN. After such an interrupt applications may call select() or poll() before restoring the interrupted GnuTLS function.

       This function's output is unreliable if you are using the same
        session in different threads for sending and receiving.

RETURNS
       0 if interrupted while trying to read data, or 1 while trying to write data.
