PIC2GRAPH(1)                General Commands Manual               PIC2GRAPH(1)

NAME
       pic2graph - convert a PIC diagram into a cropped image

SYNOPSIS
       pic2graph [-unsafe] [-format output-format] [-eqn delimiters] [convert-
                 arguments]

       pic2graph --help

       pic2graph -v
       pic2graph --version

DESCRIPTION
       pic2graph reads a pic(1) program from the standard input and writes  an
       image  file,  by  default in Portable Network Graphics (PNG) format, to
       the standard output.  It furthermore translates eqn(1)  constructs,  so
       it can be used for generating images of mathematical formulae.

       The  input  PIC  code should not be wrapped with the .PS and .PE macros
       that normally guard it within groff(1) documents.

       Arguments not recognized by pic2graph are passed to the ImageMagick  or
       GraphicsMagick  program  convert(1).  By specifying these, you can give
       your image a border, set the image's pixel density,  or  perform  other
       useful transformations.

       The  output image is clipped using convert's -trim option to the small‐
       est possible bounding box that contains all the black pixels.

OPTIONS
       -eqn delimiters
              Use delimiters as the opening and closing  characters  that  de‐
              limit  eqn directives; the default is “$$”.  The option argument
              delimiters should be a two-character string, but an empty string
              ("") is accepted as a directive to disable eqn processing.

       -format output-format
              Write  the  image  in output-format, which must be understood by
              convert; the default is PNG.

       --help Display a usage message and exit.

       -unsafe
              Run groff in unsafe mode, enabling the PIC command sh to execute
              arbitrary  Unix  shell commands.  The groff default is to forbid
              this.

       -v
       --version
              Display version information and exit.

ENVIRONMENT
       GROFF_TMPDIR
       TMPDIR
       TMP
       TEMP   These environment variables are searched in the given  order  to
              determine  the  directory where temporary files will be created.
              If none are set, /tmp is used.
