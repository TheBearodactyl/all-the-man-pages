NAME
       ares_inet_pton - convert an IPv4 or IPv6 address from text to binary form

SYNOPSIS
       #include <ares.h>

       const char *ares_inet_pton(int af, const char *src, void *dst);

DESCRIPTION
       This is a portable version with the identical functionality of the commonly available inet_pton.

       The  ares_inet_pton()  function  converts the address in its standard text presentation form into its numeric binary form. The af argument shall specify the family of the address. The AF_INET and
       AF_INET6 address families shall be supported. The src argument points to the string being passed in. The dst argument points to a buffer into which the function stores the numeric  address;  this
       shall be large enough to hold the numeric address (32 bits for AF_INET, 128 bits for AF_INET6).
