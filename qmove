PROLOG
       This  manual  page is part of the POSIX Programmer's Manual.  The Linux
       implementation of this interface may differ (consult the  corresponding
       Linux  manual page for details of Linux behavior), or the interface may
       not be implemented on Linux.

NAME
       qmove — move batch jobs

SYNOPSIS
       qmove destination job_identifier...

DESCRIPTION
       To move a batch job is to remove the batch job from the batch queue  in
       which  it resides and instantiate the batch job in another batch queue.
       A batch job is moved by a request to the batch server that manages  the
       batch job. The qmove utility is a user-accessible batch client that re‐
       quests the movement of one or more batch jobs.

       The qmove utility shall move those batch jobs,  and  only  those  batch
       jobs, for which a batch job_identifier is presented to the utility.

       The  qmove utility shall move batch jobs in the order in which the cor‐
       responding batch job_identifiers are presented to the utility.

       If the qmove utility fails to process a batch  job_identifier  success‐
       fully,  the  utility  shall  proceed  to  process  the  remaining batch
       job_identifiers, if any.

       The qmove utility shall move batch jobs by sending a Move  Job  Request
       to  the  batch  server  that  manages each batch job. The qmove utility
       shall not exit before the batch jobs corresponding to all  successfully
       processed batch job_identifiers have been moved.

OPTIONS
       None.

OPERANDS
       The  qmove utility shall accept one operand that conforms to the syntax
       for a destination (see Section 3.3.2, Destination).

       The qmove utility shall accept one or more operands that conform to the
       syntax for a batch job_identifier (see Section 3.3.1, Batch Job Identi‐
       fier).

STDIN
       Not used.

INPUT FILES
       None.

ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
       The following environment  variables  shall  affect  the  execution  of
       qmove:

       LANG      Provide  a  default  value for the internationalization vari‐
                 ables that are unset or null. (See the Base Definitions  vol‐
                 ume  of POSIX.1‐2017, Section 8.2, Internationalization Vari‐
                 ables the precedence of internationalization  variables  used
                 to determine the values of locale categories.)

       LC_ALL    If  set  to  a non-empty string value, override the values of
                 all the other internationalization variables.

       LC_CTYPE  Determine the locale for the interpretation of  sequences  of
                 bytes of text data as characters (for example, single-byte as
                 opposed to multi-byte characters in arguments).

       LC_MESSAGES
                 Determine the locale that should be used to affect the format
                 and  contents  of diagnostic messages written to standard er‐
                 ror.

       LOGNAME   Determine the login name of the user.

ASYNCHRONOUS EVENTS
       Default.

STDOUT
       None.

STDERR
       The standard error shall be used only for diagnostic messages.

OUTPUT FILES
       None.

EXTENDED DESCRIPTION
       None.

EXIT STATUS
       The following exit values shall be returned:

        0    Successful completion.

       >0    An error occurred.

CONSEQUENCES OF ERRORS
       In addition to the default behavior, the qmove utility shall not be re‐
       quired  to  write a diagnostic message to standard error when the error
       reply received from a batch server indicates that the batch job_identi‐
       fier  does  not  exist  on the server. Whether or not the qmove utility
       waits to output the diagnostic message while attempting to  locate  the
       job on other servers is implementation-defined.

       The following sections are informative.

APPLICATION USAGE
       None.

EXAMPLES
       None.

RATIONALE
       The qmove utility allows users to move jobs between queues.

       The  alternative  to using the qmove utility—deleting the batch job and
       requeuing it—entails considerably more typing.

       Since the means of selecting jobs based on attributes has been encapsu‐
       lated in the qselect utility, the only option of the qmove utility con‐
       cerns authorization. The -u option provides the user  with  the  conve‐
       nience  of  changing the user identifier under which the batch job will
       execute. Minimalism and consistency have taken precedence  over  conve‐
       nience;  the -u option has been deleted because the equivalent capabil‐
       ity exists with the -u option of the qalter utility.

FUTURE DIRECTIONS
       The qmove utility may be removed in a future version.
