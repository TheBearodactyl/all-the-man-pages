NAME
       gnutls_alert_send_appropriate - API function

SYNOPSIS
       #include <gnutls/gnutls.h>

       int gnutls_alert_send_appropriate(gnutls_session_t session, int err);

ARGUMENTS
       gnutls_session_t session
                   is a gnutls_session_t type.

       int err     is an error code returned by another GnuTLS function

DESCRIPTION
       Sends an alert to the peer depending on the error code returned by a gnutls function. This function will call gnutls_error_to_alert() to determine the appropriate alert to send.

       This function may also return GNUTLS_E_AGAIN, or GNUTLS_E_INTERRUPTED.

       This  function  historically  was  always sending an alert to the peer, even if  err was inappropriate to respond with an alert (e.g., GNUTLS_E_SUCCESS). Since 3.6.6 this function returns success
       without transmitting any data on error codes that should not result to an alert.

RETURNS
       On success, GNUTLS_E_SUCCESS (0) is returned, otherwise an error code is returned.
