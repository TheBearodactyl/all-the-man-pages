SD_BUS_IS_OPEN(3)               sd_bus_is_open               SD_BUS_IS_OPEN(3)

NAME
       sd_bus_is_open, sd_bus_is_ready - Check whether the bus connection is
       open or ready

SYNOPSIS
       #include <systemd/sd-bus.h>

       int sd_bus_is_open(sd_bus *bus);

       int sd_bus_is_ready(sd_bus *bus);

DESCRIPTION
       sd_bus_is_open() checks whether the specified bus connection is open,
       i.e. in the process of being established, already established or in the
       process of being torn down. It returns zero when the connection has not
       been started yet (i.e.  sd_bus_start(3) or some equivalent call has not
       been invoked yet), or is fully terminated again (for example after
       sd_bus_close(3)), it returns positive otherwise.

       sd_bus_is_ready() checks whether the specified connection is fully
       established, i.e. completed the connection and authentication phases of
       the protocol and received the Hello() method call response, and is not
       in the process of being torn down again. It returns zero outside of
       this state, and positive otherwise. Effectively, this function returns
       positive while regular messages can be sent or received on the
       connection.

       The bus argument may be NULL, zero is also returned in that case.

       To be notified when the connection is fully established, use
       sd_bus_set_connected_signal(3) and install a match for the Connected()
       signal on the "org.freedesktop.DBus.Local" interface. To be notified
       when the connection is torn down again, install a match for the
       Disconnected() signal on the "org.freedesktop.DBus.Local" interface.

RETURN VALUE
       Those functions return 0 if the bus is not in the given state, and a
       positive integer when it is. On failure, a negative errno-style error
       code is returned.

   Errors
       Returned errors may indicate the following problems:

       -ECHILD
           The bus connection has been created in a different process.

NOTES
       These APIs are implemented as a shared library, which can be compiled
       and linked to with the libsystemd pkg-config(1) file.
