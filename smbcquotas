DESCRIPTION
       This tool is part of the samba(7) suite.

       The smbcquotas program manipulates NT Quotas on SMB file shares.

OPTIONS
       The following options are available to the smbcquotas program.

       -u|--quota-user user
           Specifies the user of whom the quotas are get or set. By default
           the current user's username will be used.

       -L|--list
           Lists all quota records of the share.

       -F|--fs
           Show the share quota status and default limits.

       -S|--set QUOTA_SET_COMMAND
           This command sets/modifies quotas for a user or on the share,
           depending on the QUOTA_SET_COMMAND parameter which is described
           later.

       -n|--numeric
           This option displays all QUOTA information in numeric format. The
           default is to convert SIDs to names and QUOTA limits to a readable
           string format.

       -t|--test-args
           Don't actually do anything, only validate the correctness of the
           arguments.

       -v|--verbose
           Be verbose.

       -?|--help
           Print a summary of command line options.

       --usage
           Display brief usage message.

       -d|--debuglevel=DEBUGLEVEL
           level is an integer from 0 to 10. The default value if this
           parameter is not specified is 1 for client applications.

           The higher this value, the more detail will be logged to the log
           files about the activities of the server. At level 0, only critical
           errors and serious warnings will be logged. Level 1 is a reasonable
           level for day-to-day running - it generates a small amount of
           information about operations carried out.

           Levels above 1 will generate considerable amounts of log data, and
           should only be used when investigating a problem. Levels above 3
           are designed for use only by developers and generate HUGE amounts
           of log data, most of which is extremely cryptic.

           Note that specifying this parameter here will override the log
           level parameter in the /etc/samba/smb.conf file.

       --debug-stdout
           This will redirect debug output to STDOUT. By default all clients
           are logging to STDERR.

       --configfile=<configuration file>
           The file specified contains the configuration details required by
           the client. The information in this file can be general for client
           and server or only provide client specific like options such as
           client smb encrypt. See /etc/samba/smb.conf for more information.
           The default configuration file name is determined at compile time.

       --option=<name>=<value>
           Set the smb.conf(5) option "<name>" to value "<value>" from the
           command line. This overrides compiled-in defaults and options read
           from the configuration file. If a name or a value includes a space,
           wrap whole --option=name=value into quotes.

       -l|--log-basename=logdirectory
           Base directory name for log/debug files. The extension ".progname"
           will be appended (e.g. log.smbclient, log.smbd, etc...). The log
           file is never removed by the client.

       --leak-report
           Enable talloc leak reporting on exit.

       --leak-report-full
           Enable full talloc leak reporting on exit.

       -V|--version
           Prints the program version number.

       -R|--name-resolve=NAME-RESOLVE-ORDER
           This option is used to determine what naming services and in what
           order to resolve host names to IP addresses. The option takes a
           space-separated string of different name resolution options. The
           best ist to wrap the whole --name-resolve=NAME-RESOLVE-ORDER into
           quotes.

           The options are: "lmhosts", "host", "wins" and "bcast". They cause
           names to be resolved as follows:

                  •   lmhosts: Lookup an IP address in the Samba lmhosts file.
                      If the line in lmhosts has no name type attached to the
                      NetBIOS name (see the lmhosts(5) for details) then any
                      name type matches for lookup.

                  •   host: Do a standard host name to IP address resolution,
                      using the system /etc/hosts, NIS, or DNS lookups. This
                      method of name resolution is operating system dependent,
                      for instance on IRIX or Solaris this may be controlled
                      by the /etc/nsswitch.conf file). Note that this method
                      is only used if the NetBIOS name type being queried is
                      the 0x20 (server) name type, otherwise it is ignored.

                  •   wins: Query a name with the IP address listed in the
                      wins server parameter. If no WINS server has been
                      specified this method will be ignored.

                  •   bcast: Do a broadcast on each of the known local
                      interfaces listed in the interfaces parameter. This is
                      the least reliable of the name resolution methods as it
                      depends on the target host being on a locally connected
                      subnet.

           If this parameter is not set then the name resolve order defined in
           the /etc/samba/smb.conf file parameter (name resolve order) will be
           used.

           The default order is lmhosts, host, wins, bcast. Without this
           parameter or any entry in the name resolve order parameter of the
           /etc/samba/smb.conf file, the name resolution methods will be
           attempted in this order.

       -O|--socket-options=SOCKETOPTIONS
           TCP socket options to set on the client socket. See the socket
           options parameter in the /etc/samba/smb.conf manual page for the
           list of valid options.

       -m|--max-protocol=MAXPROTOCOL
           The value of the parameter (a string) is the highest protocol level
           that will be supported by the client.

           Note that specifying this parameter here will override the client
           max protocol parameter in the /etc/samba/smb.conf file.

       -n|--netbiosname=NETBIOSNAME
           This option allows you to override the NetBIOS name that Samba uses
           for itself. This is identical to setting the netbios name parameter
           in the /etc/samba/smb.conf file. However, a command line setting
           will take precedence over settings in /etc/samba/smb.conf.

       --netbios-scope=SCOPE
           This specifies a NetBIOS scope that nmblookup will use to
           communicate with when generating NetBIOS names. For details on the
           use of NetBIOS scopes, see rfc1001.txt and rfc1002.txt. NetBIOS
           scopes are very rarely used, only set this parameter if you are the
           system administrator in charge of all the NetBIOS systems you
           communicate with.

       -W|--workgroup=WORKGROUP
           Set the SMB domain of the username. This overrides the default
           domain which is the domain defined in smb.conf. If the domain
           specified is the same as the servers NetBIOS name, it causes the
           client to log on using the servers local SAM (as opposed to the
           Domain SAM).

           Note that specifying this parameter here will override the
           workgroup parameter in the /etc/samba/smb.conf file.

       -r|--realm=REALM
           Set the realm for the domain.

           Note that specifying this parameter here will override the realm
           parameter in the /etc/samba/smb.conf file.

       -U|--user=[DOMAIN\]USERNAME[%PASSWORD]
           Sets the SMB username or username and password.

           If %PASSWORD is not specified, the user will be prompted. The
           client will first check the USER environment variable (which is
           also permitted to also contain the password separated by a %), then
           the LOGNAME variable (which is not permitted to contain a password)
           and if either exists, the value is used. If these environmental
           variables are not found, the username found in a Kerberos
           Credentials cache may be used.

           A third option is to use a credentials file which contains the
           plaintext of the username and password. This option is mainly
           provided for scripts where the admin does not wish to pass the
           credentials on the command line or via environment variables. If
           this method is used, make certain that the permissions on the file
           restrict access from unwanted users. See the -A for more details.

           Be cautious about including passwords in scripts or passing
           user-supplied values onto the command line. For security it is
           better to let the Samba client tool ask for the password if needed,
           or obtain the password once with kinit.

           While Samba will attempt to scrub the password from the process
           title (as seen in ps), this is after startup and so is subject to a
           race.

       -N|--no-pass
           If specified, this parameter suppresses the normal password prompt
           from the client to the user. This is useful when accessing a
           service that does not require a password.

           Unless a password is specified on the command line or this
           parameter is specified, the client will request a password.

           If a password is specified on the command line and this option is
           also defined the password on the command line will be silently
           ignored and no password will be used.

       --password
           Specify the password on the commandline.

           Be cautious about including passwords in scripts or passing
           user-supplied values onto the command line. For security it is
           better to let the Samba client tool ask for the password if needed,
           or obtain the password once with kinit.

           If --password is not specified, the tool will check the PASSWD
           environment variable, followed by PASSWD_FD which is expected to
           contain an open file descriptor (FD) number.

           Finally it will check PASSWD_FILE (containing a file path to be
           opened). The file should only contain the password. Make certain
           that the permissions on the file restrict access from unwanted
           users!

           While Samba will attempt to scrub the password from the process
           title (as seen in ps), this is after startup and so is subject to a
           race.

       --pw-nt-hash
           The supplied password is the NT hash.

       -A|--authentication-file=filename
           This option allows you to specify a file from which to read the
           username and password used in the connection. The format of the
           file is:

                                   username = <value>
                                   password = <value>
                                   domain   = <value>

           Make certain that the permissions on the file restrict access from
           unwanted users!

       -P|--machine-pass
           Use stored machine account password.

       --simple-bind-dn=DN
           DN to use for a simple bind.

       --use-kerberos=desired|required|off
           This parameter determines whether Samba client tools will try to
           authenticate using Kerberos. For Kerberos authentication you need
           to use dns names instead of IP addresses when connecting to a
           service.

           Note that specifying this parameter here will override the client
           use kerberos parameter in the /etc/samba/smb.conf file.

       --use-krb5-ccache=CCACHE
           Specifies the credential cache location for Kerberos
           authentication.

           This will set --use-kerberos=required too.

       --use-winbind-ccache
           Try to use the credential cache by winbind.

       --client-protection=sign|encrypt|off
           Sets the connection protection the client tool should use.

           Note that specifying this parameter here will override the client
           protection parameter in the /etc/samba/smb.conf file.

           In case you need more fine grained control you can use:
           --option=clientsmbencrypt=OPTION, --option=clientipcsigning=OPTION,
           --option=clientsigning=OPTION.

QUOTA_SET_COMMAND
       The format of an the QUOTA_SET_COMMAND is an operation name followed by
       a set of parameters specific to that operation.

       To set user quotas for the user specified by -u or for the current
       username:

        UQLIM:<username>:<softlimit>/<hardlimit>

       To set the default quotas for a share:

        FSQLIM:<softlimit>/<hardlimit>

       To change the share quota settings:

        FSQFLAGS:QUOTA_ENABLED/DENY_DISK/LOG_SOFTLIMIT/LOG_HARD_LIMIT

       All limits are specified as a number of bytes.

EXIT STATUS
       The smbcquotas program sets the exit status depending on the success or
       otherwise of the operations performed. The exit status may be one of
       the following values.

       If the operation succeeded, smbcquotas returns an exit status of 0. If
       smbcquotas couldn't connect to the specified server, or when there was
       an error getting or setting the quota(s), an exit status of 1 is
       returned. If there was an error parsing any command line arguments, an
       exit status of 2 is returned.
