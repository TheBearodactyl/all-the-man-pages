NAME
       XkbAddGeomShape - Add a shape to a keyboard geometry

SYNOPSIS
       XkbShapePtr XkbAddGeomShape (XkbGeometryPtr geom, Atom name, int sz_outlines);

ARGUMENTS
       geom   geometry to be updated

       name   name of the new shape

       sz_outlines
              number of outlines to be reserved

DESCRIPTION
       Xkb  provides  functions  to add a single new element to the top-level keyboard geometry. In each case the num_ * fields of the corresponding structure is incremented by 1. These functions do not
       change sz_* unless there is no more room in the array. Some of these functions fill in the values of the element's structure from the arguments. For other functions,  you  must  explicitly  write
       code to fill the structure's elements.

       The top-level geometry description includes a list of geometry properties.  A geometry property associates an arbitrary string with an equally arbitrary name. Programs that display images of key‐
       boards can use geometry properties as hints, but they are not interpreted by Xkb. No other geometry structures refer to geometry properties.

       A geometry contains an arbitrary number of shapes, each of which is made up of an arbitrary number of outlines.  XkbAddGeomShape adds a shape to a geometry geom by allocating  space  for  sz_out‐
       lines  outlines  for  it and giving it the name specified by name.  If a shape with name name already exists in the geometry, a pointer to the existing shape is returned.  XkbAddGeomShape returns
       NULL if any of the parameters is empty or if it was not able to allocate space. To allocate space for an arbitrary number of geometry shapes, use XkbAllocGeomShapes.

STRUCTURES
           typedef struct _XkbShape {
               Atom              name;           /* shape's name */
               unsigned short    num_outlines;   /* number of outlines for the shape */
               unsigned short    sz_outlines;    /* size of the outlines array */
               XkbOutlinePtr     outlines;       /* array of outlines for the shape */
               XkbOutlinePtr     approx;         /* pointer into the array to the approximating outline */
               XkbOutlinePtr     primary;        /* pointer into the array to the primary outline */
               XkbBoundsRec      bounds;         /* bounding box for the shape; encompasses all outlines */
           } XkbShapeRec, *XkbShapePtr;
