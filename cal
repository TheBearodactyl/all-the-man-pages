NAME
       cal - display a calendar

SYNOPSIS
       cal [options] [[[day] month] year]

       cal [options] [timestamp|monthname]

DESCRIPTION
       cal displays a simple calendar. If no arguments are specified, the current month is displayed.

       The month may be specified as a number (1-12), as a month name or as an abbreviated month name according to the current locales.

       Two different calendar systems are used, Gregorian and Julian. These are nearly identical systems with Gregorian making a small adjustment to the frequency of leap years; this facilitates
       improved synchronization with solar events like the equinoxes. The Gregorian calendar reform was introduced in 1582, but its adoption continued up to 1923. By default cal uses the adoption date
       of 3 Sept 1752. From that date forward the Gregorian calendar is displayed; previous dates use the Julian calendar system. 11 days were removed at the time of adoption to bring the calendar in
       sync with solar events. So Sept 1752 has a mix of Julian and Gregorian dates by which the 2nd is followed by the 14th (the 3rd through the 13th are absent).

       Optionally, either the proleptic Gregorian calendar or the Julian calendar may be used exclusively. See --reform below.

OPTIONS
       -1, --one
           Display single month output. (This is the default.)

       -3, --three
           Display three months spanning the date.

       -n , --months number
           Display number of months, starting from the month containing the date.

       -S, --span
           Display months spanning the date.

       -s, --sunday
           Display Sunday as the first day of the week.

       -m, --monday
           Display Monday as the first day of the week.

       -v, --vertical
           Display using a vertical layout (aka ncal(1) mode).

       --iso
           Display the proleptic Gregorian calendar exclusively. This option does not affect week numbers and the first day of the week. See --reform below.

       -j, --julian
           Use day-of-year numbering for all calendars. These are also called ordinal days. Ordinal days range from 1 to 366. This option does not switch from the Gregorian to the Julian calendar
           system, that is controlled by the --reform option.

           Sometimes Gregorian calendars using ordinal dates are referred to as Julian calendars. This can be confusing due to the many date related conventions that use Julian in their name: (ordinal)
           julian date, julian (calendar) date, (astronomical) julian date, (modified) julian date, and more. This option is named julian, because ordinal days are identified as julian by the POSIX
           standard. However, be aware that cal also uses the Julian calendar system. See DESCRIPTION above.

       --reform val
           This option sets the adoption date of the Gregorian calendar reform. Calendar dates previous to reform use the Julian calendar system. Calendar dates after reform use the Gregorian calendar
           system. The argument val can be:

           •   1752 - sets 3 September 1752 as the reform date (default). This is when the Gregorian calendar reform was adopted by the British Empire.

           •   gregorian - display Gregorian calendars exclusively. This special placeholder sets the reform date below the smallest year that cal can use; meaning all calendar output uses the Gregorian
               calendar system. This is called the proleptic Gregorian calendar, because dates prior to the calendar system’s creation use extrapolated values.

           •   iso - alias of gregorian. The ISO 8601 standard for the representation of dates and times in information interchange requires using the proleptic Gregorian calendar.

           •   julian - display Julian calendars exclusively. This special placeholder sets the reform date above the largest year that cal can use; meaning all calendar output uses the Julian calendar
               system.

       See DESCRIPTION above.

       -y, --year
           Display a calendar for the whole year.

       -Y, --twelve
           Display a calendar for the next twelve months.

       -w, --week[=number]
           Display week numbers in the calendar (US or ISO-8601). See the NOTES section for more details.

       --color[=when]
           Colorize the output. The optional argument when can be auto, never or always. If the when argument is omitted, it defaults to auto. The colors can be disabled; for the current built-in
           default see the --help output. See also the COLORS section.

       -h, --help
           Display help text and exit.

       -V, --version
           Print version and exit.

PARAMETERS
       Single digits-only parameter (e.g., 'cal 2020')
           Specifies the year to be displayed; note the year must be fully specified: cal 89 will not display a calendar for 1989.

       Single string parameter (e.g., 'cal tomorrow' or 'cal August')
           Specifies timestamp or a month name (or abbreviated name) according to the current locales.

           The special placeholders are accepted when parsing timestamp, "now" may be used to refer to the current time, "today", "yesterday", "tomorrow" refer to of the current day, the day before or
           the next day, respectively.

           The relative date specifications are also accepted, in this case "+" is evaluated to the current time plus the specified time span. Correspondingly, a time span that is prefixed with "-" is
           evaluated to the current time minus the specified time span, for example '+2days'. Instead of prefixing the time span with "+" or "-", it may also be suffixed with a space and the word "left"
           or "ago" (for example '1 week ago').

       Two parameters (e.g., 'cal 11 2020')
           Denote the month (1 - 12) and year.

       Three parameters (e.g., 'cal 25 11 2020')
           Denote the day (1-31), month and year, and the day will be highlighted if the calendar is displayed on a terminal. If no parameters are specified, the current month’s calendar is displayed.

NOTES
       A year starts on January 1. The first day of the week is determined by the locale or the --sunday and --monday options.

       The week numbering depends on the choice of the first day of the week. If it is Sunday then the customary North American numbering is used, where 1 January is in week number 1. If it is Monday
       (-m) then the ISO 8601 standard week numbering is used, where the first Thursday is in week number 1.

COLORS
       The output colorization is implemented by terminal-colors.d(5) functionality. Implicit coloring can be disabled by an empty file

          /etc/terminal-colors.d/cal.disable

       for the cal command or for all tools by

          /etc/terminal-colors.d/disable

       The user-specific $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/terminal-colors.d or $HOME/.config/terminal-colors.d overrides the global setting.

       Note that the output colorization may be enabled by default, and in this case terminal-colors.d directories do not have to exist yet.

HISTORY
       A cal command appeared in Version 6 AT&T UNIX.

BUGS
       The default cal output uses 3 September 1752 as the Gregorian calendar reform date. The historical reform dates for the other locales, including its introduction in October 1582, are not
       implemented.

       Alternative calendars, such as the Umm al-Qura, the Solar Hijri, the Ge’ez, or the lunisolar Hindu, are not supported.

NAME
       cal — print a calendar

SYNOPSIS
       cal [[month] year]

DESCRIPTION
       The cal utility shall write a calendar to standard output using the Julian calendar for dates from January 1, 1 through September 2, 1752 and the Gregorian calendar for dates from  September  14,
       1752 through December 31, 9999 as though the Gregorian calendar had been adopted on September 14, 1752.

       If  no  operands are given, cal shall produce a one-month calendar for the current month in the current year. If only the year operand is given, cal shall produce a calendar for all twelve months
       in the given calendar year. If both month and year operands are given, cal shall produce a one-month calendar for the given month in the given year.

OPTIONS
       None.

OPERANDS
       The following operands shall be supported:

       month     Specify the month to be displayed, represented as a decimal integer from 1 (January) to 12 (December).

       year      Specify the year for which the calendar is displayed, represented as a decimal integer from 1 to 9999.

STDIN
       Not used.

INPUT FILES
       None.

ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
       The following environment variables shall affect the execution of cal:

       LANG      Provide a default value for the internationalization variables that are unset or null. (See the Base Definitions volume of POSIX.1‐2017, Section 8.2, Internationalization Variables  for
                 the precedence of internationalization variables used to determine the values of locale categories.)

       LC_ALL    If set to a non-empty string value, override the values of all the other internationalization variables.

       LC_CTYPE  Determine the locale for the interpretation of sequences of bytes of text data as characters (for example, single-byte as opposed to multi-byte characters in arguments).

       LC_MESSAGES
                 Determine the locale that should be used to affect the format and contents of diagnostic messages written to standard error, and informative messages written to standard output.

       LC_TIME   Determine the format and contents of the calendar.

       NLSPATH   Determine the location of message catalogs for the processing of LC_MESSAGES.

       TZ        Determine the timezone used to calculate the value of the current month.

ASYNCHRONOUS EVENTS
       Default.

STDOUT
       The standard output shall be used to display the calendar, in an unspecified format.

STDERR
       The standard error shall be used only for diagnostic messages.

OUTPUT FILES
       None.

EXTENDED DESCRIPTION
       None.

EXIT STATUS
       The following exit values shall be returned:

        0    Successful completion.

       >0    An error occurred.

CONSEQUENCES OF ERRORS
       Default.

       The following sections are informative.

APPLICATION USAGE
       Note that:

           cal 83

       refers to A.D. 83, not 1983.

EXAMPLES
       None.

RATIONALE
       Earlier versions of this standard incorrectly required that the command:

           cal 2000

       write  a  one-month  calendar for the current calendar month (no matter what the current year is) in the year 2000 to standard output. This did not match historic practice in any known version of
       the cal utility. The description has been updated to match historic practice.  When only the year operand is given, cal writes a twelve-month calendar for the specified year.

FUTURE DIRECTIONS
       A future version of this standard may support locale-specific recognition of the date of adoption of the Gregorian calendar.
