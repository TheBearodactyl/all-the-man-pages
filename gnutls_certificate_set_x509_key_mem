NAME
       gnutls_certificate_set_x509_key_mem - API function

SYNOPSIS
       #include <gnutls/gnutls.h>

       int gnutls_certificate_set_x509_key_mem(gnutls_certificate_credentials_t res, const gnutls_datum_t * cert, const gnutls_datum_t * key, gnutls_x509_crt_fmt_t type);

ARGUMENTS
       gnutls_certificate_credentials_t res
                   is a gnutls_certificate_credentials_t type.

       const gnutls_datum_t * cert
                   contains a certificate list (path) for the specified private key

       const gnutls_datum_t * key
                   is the private key, or NULL

       gnutls_x509_crt_fmt_t type
                   is PEM or DER

DESCRIPTION
       This  function  sets  a  certificate/private  key  pair  in the gnutls_certificate_credentials_t type. This function may be called more than once, in case multiple keys/certificates exist for the
       server.

       Note that the keyUsage (2.5.29.15) PKIX extension in X.509 certificates is supported. This means that certificates intended for signing cannot be used for ciphersuites that require encryption.

       If the certificate and the private key are given in PEM encoding then the strings that hold their values must be null terminated.

       The  key may be NULL if you are using a sign callback, see gnutls_sign_callback_set().

       Note that, this function by default returns zero on success and a negative value on error.  Since 3.5.6, when the flag GNUTLS_CERTIFICATE_API_V2 is set using gnutls_certificate_set_flags() it re‐
       turns an index (greater or equal to zero). That index can be used to other functions to refer to the added key-pair.

RETURNS
       On success this functions returns zero, and otherwise a negative value on error (see above for modifying that behavior).
