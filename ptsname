ptsname(3)                 Library Functions Manual                 ptsname(3)

NAME
       ptsname, ptsname_r - get the name of the slave pseudoterminal

LIBRARY
       Standard C library (libc, -lc)

SYNOPSIS
       #include <stdlib.h>

       char *ptsname(int fd);
       int ptsname_r(int fd, char buf[.buflen], size_t buflen);

   Feature Test Macro Requirements for glibc (see feature_test_macros(7)):

       ptsname():
           Since glibc 2.24:
               _XOPEN_SOURCE >= 500
           glibc 2.23 and earlier:
               _XOPEN_SOURCE

       ptsname_r():
           _GNU_SOURCE

DESCRIPTION
       The ptsname() function returns the name of the slave pseudoterminal de‐
       vice corresponding to the master referred to by the file descriptor fd.

       The ptsname_r() function is the reentrant equivalent of ptsname().   It
       returns  the  name  of the slave pseudoterminal device as a null-termi‐
       nated string in the buffer pointed to  by  buf.   The  buflen  argument
       specifies the number of bytes available in buf.

RETURN VALUE
       On  success,  ptsname() returns a pointer to a string in static storage
       which will be overwritten by subsequent calls.  This pointer  must  not
       be freed.  On failure, NULL is returned.

       On  success, ptsname_r() returns 0.  On failure, an error number is re‐
       turned to indicate the error.

ERRORS
       EINVAL (ptsname_r() only) buf is NULL.  (This error  is  returned  only
              for glibc 2.25 and earlier.)

       ENOTTY fd does not refer to a pseudoterminal master device.

       ERANGE (ptsname_r() only) buf is too small.

VERSIONS
       A version of ptsname_r() is documented on Tru64 and HP-UX, but on those
       implementations,  -1  is  returned on error, with errno set to indicate
       the error.  Avoid using this function in portable programs.

STANDARDS
       ptsname():
              POSIX.1-2008.

       ptsname_r() is a Linux extension, that is proposed for inclusion in the
       next major revision of POSIX.1 (Issue 8).

HISTORY
       ptsname():
              POSIX.1-2001.  glibc 2.1.

       ptsname() is part of the UNIX 98 pseudoterminal support (see pts(4)).

PROLOG
       This  manual  page is part of the POSIX Programmer's Manual.  The Linux
       implementation of this interface may differ (consult the  corresponding
       Linux  manual page for details of Linux behavior), or the interface may
       not be implemented on Linux.

NAME
       ptsname — get name of the slave pseudo-terminal device

SYNOPSIS
       #include <stdlib.h>

       char *ptsname(int fildes);

DESCRIPTION
       The ptsname() function shall return the name of the slave pseudo-termi‐
       nal  device associated with a master pseudo-terminal device. The fildes
       argument is a file descriptor that refers to the master device. The pt‐
       sname()  function  shall  return  a  pointer to a string containing the
       pathname of the corresponding slave device.

       The ptsname() function need not be thread-safe.

RETURN VALUE
       Upon successful completion, ptsname()  shall  return  a  pointer  to  a
       string  which  is  the  name  of the pseudo-terminal slave device. Upon
       failure, ptsname() shall return a null pointer and may set errno.  This
       could occur if fildes is an invalid file descriptor or if the slave de‐
       vice name does not exist in the file system.

       The application shall not modify  the  string  returned.  The  returned
       pointer might be invalidated or the string content might be overwritten
       by a subsequent call to ptsname().  The returned pointer and the string
       content might also be invalidated if the calling thread is terminated.

ERRORS
       The ptsname() function may fail if:

       EBADF  The fildes argument is not a valid file descriptor.

       ENOTTY The  file  associated  with  the fildes argument is not a master
              pseudo-terminal device.
