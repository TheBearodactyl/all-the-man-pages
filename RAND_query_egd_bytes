RAND_EGD(3ssl)                      OpenSSL                     RAND_EGD(3ssl)

NAME
       RAND_egd, RAND_egd_bytes, RAND_query_egd_bytes - query entropy
       gathering daemon

SYNOPSIS
        #include <openssl/rand.h>

        int RAND_egd_bytes(const char *path, int num);
        int RAND_egd(const char *path);

        int RAND_query_egd_bytes(const char *path, unsigned char *buf, int num);

DESCRIPTION
       On older platforms without a good source of randomness such as
       "/dev/urandom", it is possible to query an Entropy Gathering Daemon
       (EGD) over a local socket to obtain randomness and seed the OpenSSL
       RNG.  The protocol used is defined by the EGDs available at
       <http://egd.sourceforge.net/> or <http://prngd.sourceforge.net>.

       RAND_egd_bytes() requests num bytes of randomness from an EGD at the
       specified socket path, and passes the data it receives into RAND_add().
       RAND_egd() is equivalent to RAND_egd_bytes() with num set to 255.

       RAND_query_egd_bytes() requests num bytes of randomness from an EGD at
       the specified socket path, where num must be less than 256.  If buf is
       NULL, it is equivalent to RAND_egd_bytes().  If buf is not NULL, then
       the data is copied to the buffer and RAND_add() is not called.

       OpenSSL can be configured at build time to try to use the EGD for
       seeding automatically.

RETURN VALUES
       RAND_egd() and RAND_egd_bytes() return the number of bytes read from
       the daemon on success, or -1 if the connection failed or the daemon did
       not return enough data to fully seed the PRNG.

       RAND_query_egd_bytes() returns the number of bytes read from the daemon
       on success, or -1 if the connection failed.
