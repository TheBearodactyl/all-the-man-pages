NAME
       curl_easy_unescape - URL decodes the given string

SYNOPSIS
       #include <curl/curl.h>

       char *curl_easy_unescape(CURL *curl, const char *url,
                                int inlength, int *outlength);

DESCRIPTION
       This  function converts the given URL encoded input string to a "plain string" and returns that in an allocated memory area. All input characters that are URL encoded (%XX where XX is a two-digit
       hexadecimal number) are converted to their binary versions.

       If the length argument is set to 0 (zero), curl_easy_unescape(3) will use strlen() on the input url string to find out the size.

       If outlength is non-NULL, the function will write the length of the returned string in the integer it points to. This allows proper handling even for strings  containing  %00.  Since  this  is  a
       pointer to an int type, it can only return a value up to INT_MAX so no longer string can be returned in this parameter.

       Since 7.82.0, the curl parameter is ignored. Prior to that there was per-handle character conversion support for some very old operating systems such as TPF, but it was otherwise ignored.

       You must curl_free(3) the returned string when you are done with it.

EXAMPLE
       CURL *curl = curl_easy_init();
       if(curl) {
         int decodelen;
         char *decoded = curl_easy_unescape(curl, "%63%75%72%6c", 12, &decodelen);
         if(decoded) {
           /* do not assume printf() works on the decoded data! */
           printf("Decoded: ");
           /* ... */
           curl_free(decoded);
         }
         curl_easy_cleanup(curl);
       }

AVAILABILITY
       Added in 7.15.4 and replaces the old curl_unescape(3) function.

RETURN VALUE
       A pointer to a null-terminated string or NULL if it failed.
