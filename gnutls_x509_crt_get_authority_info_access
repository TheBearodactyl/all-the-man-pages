NAME
       gnutls_x509_crt_get_authority_info_access - API function

SYNOPSIS
       #include <gnutls/x509.h>

       int gnutls_x509_crt_get_authority_info_access(gnutls_x509_crt_t crt, unsigned int seq, int what, gnutls_datum_t * data, unsigned int * critical);

ARGUMENTS
       gnutls_x509_crt_t crt
                   Holds the certificate

       unsigned int seq
                   specifies the sequence number of the access descriptor (0 for the first one, 1 for the second etc.)

       int what    what data to get, a gnutls_info_access_what_t type.

       gnutls_datum_t * data
                   output data to be freed with gnutls_free().

       unsigned int * critical
                   pointer to output integer that is set to non-zero if the extension is marked as critical (may be NULL)

DESCRIPTION
       Note that a simpler API to access the authority info data is provided by gnutls_x509_aia_get() and gnutls_x509_ext_import_aia().

       This function extracts the Authority Information Access (AIA) extension, see RFC 5280 section 4.2.2.1 for more information.  The AIA extension holds a sequence of AccessDescription (AD) data.

       The   seq  input  parameter  is  used  to  indicate which member of the sequence the caller is interested in.  The first member is 0, the second member 1 and so on.  When the  seq value is out of
       bounds, GNUTLS_E_REQUESTED_DATA_NOT_AVAILABLE is returned.

       The type of data returned in  data is specified via  what which should be gnutls_info_access_what_t values.

       If  what is GNUTLS_IA_ACCESSMETHOD_OID then  data will hold the accessMethod OID (e.g., "1.3.6.1.5.5.7.48.1").

       If  what is GNUTLS_IA_ACCESSLOCATION_GENERALNAME_TYPE,  data will hold the accessLocation GeneralName type (e.g., "uniformResourceIdentifier").

       If  what is GNUTLS_IA_URI,  data will hold the accessLocation URI data.  Requesting this  what value leads to an error if the accessLocation is not of the "uniformResourceIdentifier" type.

       If  what is GNUTLS_IA_OCSP_URI,  data will hold the OCSP URI.  Requesting this  what value leads to an error if the accessMethod is not 1.3.6.1.5.5.7.48.1 aka OCSP, or if accessLocation is not of
       the "uniformResourceIdentifier" type. In that case GNUTLS_E_UNKNOWN_ALGORITHM will be returned, and  seq should be increased and this function called again.

       If  what is GNUTLS_IA_CAISSUERS_URI,  data will hold the caIssuers URI.  Requesting this  what value leads to an error if the accessMethod is not 1.3.6.1.5.5.7.48.2 aka caIssuers, or if accessLo‐
       cation is not of the "uniformResourceIdentifier" type.  In that case handle as in GNUTLS_IA_OCSP_URI.

       More  what values may be allocated in the future as needed.

       If  data is NULL, the function does the same without storing the output data, that is, it will set  critical and do error checking as usual.

       The value of the critical flag is returned in * critical .  Supply a NULL  critical if you want the function to make sure the extension is non-critical, as required by RFC 5280.

RETURNS
       GNUTLS_E_SUCCESS on success, GNUTLS_E_INVALID_REQUEST on invalid  crt , GNUTLS_E_CONSTRAINT_ERROR if the extension is incorrectly marked as  critical  (use  a  non-NULL   critical  to  override),
       GNUTLS_E_UNKNOWN_ALGORITHM if the requested OID does not match (e.g., when using GNUTLS_IA_OCSP_URI), otherwise a negative error code.

SINCE
       3.0
