SSL_ALLOC_BUFFERS(3ssl)             OpenSSL            SSL_ALLOC_BUFFERS(3ssl)

NAME
       SSL_free_buffers, SSL_alloc_buffers - manage SSL structure buffers

SYNOPSIS
        #include <openssl/ssl.h>

        int SSL_free_buffers(SSL *ssl);
        int SSL_alloc_buffers(SSL *ssl);

DESCRIPTION
       SSL_free_buffers() frees the read and write buffers of the given ssl.
       SSL_alloc_buffers() allocates the read and write buffers of the given
       ssl.

       The SSL_MODE_RELEASE_BUFFERS mode releases read or write buffers
       whenever the buffers have been drained. These functions allow
       applications to manually control when buffers are freed and allocated.

       After freeing the buffers, the buffers are automatically reallocated
       upon a new read or write. The SSL_alloc_buffers() does not need to be
       called, but can be used to make sure the buffers are preallocated. This
       can be used to avoid allocation during data processing or with
       CRYPTO_set_mem_functions() to control where and how buffers are
       allocated.

RETURN VALUES
       The following return values can occur:

       0 (Failure)
           The SSL_free_buffers() function returns 0 when there is pending
           data to be read or written. The SSL_alloc_buffers() function
           returns 0 when there is an allocation failure.

       1 (Success)
           The SSL_free_buffers() function returns 1 if the buffers have been
           freed. This value is also returned if the buffers had been freed
           before calling SSL_free_buffers().  The SSL_alloc_buffers()
           function returns 1 if the buffers have been allocated.  This value
           is also returned if the buffers had been allocated before calling
           SSL_alloc_buffers().
