NAME
       EVP_whirlpool - WHIRLPOOL For EVP

SYNOPSIS
        #include <openssl/evp.h>

        const EVP_MD *EVP_whirlpool(void);

DESCRIPTION
       WHIRLPOOL is a cryptographic hash function standardized in ISO/IEC 10118-3:2004 designed by Vincent Rijmen and Paulo S. L. M. Barreto. This implementation is only available with the legacy
       provider.

       EVP_whirlpool()
           The WHIRLPOOL algorithm that produces a message digest of 512-bits from a given input.

RETURN VALUES
       These functions return a EVP_MD structure that contains the implementation of the message digest. See EVP_MD_meth_new(3) for details of the EVP_MD structure.

CONFORMING TO
       ISO/IEC 10118-3:2004.
