NAME
       gnutls_record_disable_padding - API function

SYNOPSIS
       #include <gnutls/gnutls.h>

       void gnutls_record_disable_padding(gnutls_session_t session);

ARGUMENTS
       gnutls_session_t session
                   is a gnutls_session_t type.

DESCRIPTION
       Used  to disabled padding in TLS 1.0 and above.  Normally you do not need to use this function, but there are buggy clients that complain if a server pads the encrypted data.  This of course will
       disable protection against statistical attacks on the data.

       This function is defunct since 3.1.7. Random padding is disabled by default unless requested using gnutls_record_send_range().
