NAME
       gnutls_transport_set_int - API function

SYNOPSIS
       #include <gnutls/gnutls.h>

       void gnutls_transport_set_int(gnutls_session_t session, int fd);

ARGUMENTS
       gnutls_session_t session
                   is a gnutls_session_t type.

       int fd      is the socket descriptor for the connection.

DESCRIPTION
       This function sets the first argument of the transport function, such as send() and recv() for the default callbacks using the system's socket API.

       This function is equivalent to calling gnutls_transport_set_ptr() with the descriptor, but requires no casts.
