SSL_GET_PEER_CERTIFICATE(3ssl)      OpenSSL     SSL_GET_PEER_CERTIFICATE(3ssl)

NAME
       SSL_get_peer_certificate, SSL_get0_peer_certificate,
       SSL_get1_peer_certificate - get the X509 certificate of the peer

SYNOPSIS
        #include <openssl/ssl.h>

        X509 *SSL_get_peer_certificate(const SSL *ssl);
        X509 *SSL_get0_peer_certificate(const SSL *ssl);
        X509 *SSL_get1_peer_certificate(const SSL *ssl);

DESCRIPTION
       These functions return a pointer to the X509 certificate the peer
       presented. If the peer did not present a certificate, NULL is returned.

NOTES
       Due to the protocol definition, a TLS/SSL server will always send a
       certificate, if present. A client will only send a certificate when
       explicitly requested to do so by the server (see
       SSL_CTX_set_verify(3)). If an anonymous cipher is used, no certificates
       are sent.

       That a certificate is returned does not indicate information about the
       verification state, use SSL_get_verify_result(3) to check the
       verification state.

       The reference count of the X509 object returned by
       SSL_get1_peer_certificate() is incremented by one, so that it will not
       be destroyed when the session containing the peer certificate is freed.
       The X509 object must be explicitly freed using X509_free().

       The reference count of the X509 object returned by
       SSL_get0_peer_certificate() is not incremented, and must not be freed.

       SSL_get_peer_certificate() is an alias of SSL_get1_peer_certificate().

RETURN VALUES
       The following return values can occur:

       NULL
           No certificate was presented by the peer or no connection was
           established.

       Pointer to an X509 certificate
           The return value points to the certificate presented by the peer.

HISTORY

       in 3.0.0.  SSL_get_peer_certificate() was deprecated in 3.0.0.
