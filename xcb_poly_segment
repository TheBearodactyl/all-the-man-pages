NAME
       xcb_poly_segment - draw lines

SYNOPSIS
       #include <xcb/xproto.h>

   Request function
       xcb_void_cookie_t xcb_poly_segment(xcb_connection_t *conn, xcb_drawable_t drawable, xcb_gcontext_t gc, uint32_t segments_len, const xcb_segment_t *segments);

REQUEST ARGUMENTS
       conn      The XCB connection to X11.

       drawable  A drawable (Window or Pixmap) to draw on.

       gc        The graphics context to use.

                 TODO: document which attributes of a gc are used

       segments_len
                 The number of xcb_segment_t structures in segments.

       segments  An array of xcb_segment_t structures.

DESCRIPTION
       Draws multiple, unconnected lines. For each segment, a line is drawn between (x1, y1) and (x2, y2). The lines are drawn in the order listed in the array of xcb_segment_t structures and does not
       perform joining at coincident endpoints. For any given line, a pixel is not drawn more than once. If lines intersect, the intersecting pixels are drawn multiple times.

       TODO: include the xcb_segment_t data structure

       TODO: an example

RETURN VALUE
       Returns an xcb_void_cookie_t. Errors (if any) have to be handled in the event loop.

       If you want to handle errors directly with xcb_request_check instead, use xcb_poly_segment_checked. See xcb-requests(3) for details.

ERRORS
       xcb_drawable_error_t
                 The specified drawable does not exist.

       xcb_g_context_error_t
                 The specified gc does not exist.

       xcb_match_error_t
                 TODO: reasons?
