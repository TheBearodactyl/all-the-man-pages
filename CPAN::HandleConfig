NAME
       CPAN::HandleConfig - internal configuration handling for CPAN.pm

   "CLASS->safe_quote ITEM"
       Quotes an item to become safe against spaces in shell interpolation. An item is enclosed in double quotes if:

         - the item contains spaces in the middle
         - the item does not start with a quote

       This happens to avoid shell interpolation problems when whitespace is present in directory names.

       This method uses "commands_quote" to determine the correct quote. If "commands_quote" is a space, no quoting will take place.

       if it starts and ends with the same quote character: leave it as it is

       if it contains no whitespace: leave it as it is

       if it contains whitespace, then

       if it contains quotes: better leave it as it is

       else: quote it with the correct quote type for the box we're on
