NAME
       OSSL_CMP_MSG_http_perform - client-side HTTP(S) transfer of a CMP
       request-response pair

SYNOPSIS
        #include <openssl/cmp.h>

        OSSL_CMP_MSG *OSSL_CMP_MSG_http_perform(OSSL_CMP_CTX *ctx,
                                                const OSSL_CMP_MSG *req);

DESCRIPTION
       OSSL_CMP_MSG_http_perform() sends the given PKIMessage req to the CMP
       server specified in ctx via OSSL_CMP_CTX_set1_server(3) and optionally
       OSSL_CMP_CTX_set_serverPort(3), using any "CMP alias" optionally
       specified via OSSL_CMP_CTX_set1_serverPath(3).  The default port is 80
       for HTTP and 443 for HTTPS; the default path is "/".  On success the
       function returns the server's response PKIMessage.

       The function makes use of any HTTP callback function set via
       OSSL_CMP_CTX_set_http_cb(3).  It respects any timeout value set via
       OSSL_CMP_CTX_set_option(3) with an OSSL_CMP_OPT_MSG_TIMEOUT argument.
       It also respects any HTTP(S) proxy options set via
       OSSL_CMP_CTX_set1_proxy(3) and OSSL_CMP_CTX_set1_no_proxy(3) and the
       respective environment variables.  Proxying plain HTTP is supported
       directly, while using a proxy for HTTPS connections requires a suitable
       callback function such as OSSL_HTTP_proxy_connect(3).

NOTES
       CMP is defined in RFC 4210.  HTTP transfer for CMP is defined in RFC
       6712.

RETURN VALUES
       OSSL_CMP_MSG_http_perform() returns a CMP message on success, else
       NULL.

SEE ALSO
       OSSL_CMP_CTX_new(3), OSSL_HTTP_proxy_connect(3).

HISTORY
       The OpenSSL CMP support was added in OpenSSL 3.0.
