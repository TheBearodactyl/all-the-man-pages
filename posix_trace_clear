PROLOG
       This  manual  page is part of the POSIX Programmer's Manual.  The Linux
       implementation of this interface may differ (consult the  corresponding
       Linux  manual page for details of Linux behavior), or the interface may
       not be implemented on Linux.

NAME
       posix_trace_clear — clear trace stream and trace log (TRACING)

SYNOPSIS
       #include <sys/types.h>
       #include <trace.h>

       int posix_trace_clear(trace_id_t trid);

DESCRIPTION
       The posix_trace_clear() function shall reinitialize  the  trace  stream
       identified  by  the  argument  trid  as  if  it were returning from the
       posix_trace_create() function, except that the same allocated resources
       shall  be  reused, the mapping of trace event type identifiers to trace
       event names shall be unchanged, and the trace stream status  shall  re‐
       main  unchanged  (that is, if it was running, it remains running and if
       it was suspended, it remains suspended).

       All trace events in the  trace  stream  recorded  before  the  call  to
       posix_trace_clear()  shall be lost. The posix_stream_full_status status
       shall be set to POSIX_TRACE_NOT_FULL.  There is no guarantee  that  all
       trace  events  that  occurred  during  the posix_trace_clear() call are
       recorded; the behavior with respect to trace points that may occur dur‐
       ing this call is unspecified.

       If the Trace Log option is supported and the trace stream has been cre‐
       ated with a log, the posix_trace_clear()  function  shall  reinitialize
       the trace stream with the same behavior as if the trace stream was cre‐
       ated without the log, plus it shall reinitialize the trace log  associ‐
       ated  with  the  trace  stream identified by the argument trid as if it
       were returning from the posix_trace_create_withlog()  function,  except
       that the same allocated resources, for the trace log, may be reused and
       the associated trace stream status remains unchanged.  The first  trace
       event  recorded  in the trace log after the call to posix_trace_clear()
       shall be the same as the first trace event recorded in the active trace
       stream  after the call to posix_trace_clear().  The posix_log_full_sta‐
       tus status shall be set to POSIX_TRACE_NOT_FULL. There is no  guarantee
       that all trace events that occurred during the posix_trace_clear() call
       are recorded in the trace log;  the  behavior  with  respect  to  trace
       points  that may occur during this call is unspecified. If the log full
       policy is POSIX_TRACE_APPEND, the effect of a call to this function  is
       unspecified  for the trace log associated with the trace stream identi‐
       fied by the trid argument.

RETURN VALUE
       Upon successful completion, the posix_trace_clear() function shall  re‐
       turn  a value of zero. Otherwise, it shall return the corresponding er‐
       ror number.

ERRORS
       The posix_trace_clear() function shall fail if:

       EINVAL The value of the trid argument does not correspond to an  active
              trace stream.

FUTURE DIRECTIONS
