NAME
       gnutls_x509_crq_get_subject_alt_name - API function

SYNOPSIS
       #include <gnutls/x509.h>

       int gnutls_x509_crq_get_subject_alt_name(gnutls_x509_crq_t crq, unsigned int seq, void * ret, size_t * ret_size, unsigned int * ret_type, unsigned int * critical);

ARGUMENTS
       gnutls_x509_crq_t crq
                   should contain a gnutls_x509_crq_t type

       unsigned int seq
                   specifies the sequence number of the alt name, 0 for the first one, 1 for the second etc.

       void * ret  is the place where the alternative name will be copied to

       size_t * ret_size
                   holds the size of ret.

       unsigned int * ret_type
                   holds the gnutls_x509_subject_alt_name_t name type

       unsigned int * critical
                   will be non-zero if the extension is marked as critical (may be null)

DESCRIPTION
       This  function will return the alternative names, contained in the given certificate.  It is the same as gnutls_x509_crq_get_subject_alt_name() except for the fact that it will return the type of
       the alternative name in  ret_type even if the function fails for some reason (i.e.  the buffer provided is not enough).

RETURNS
       the alternative subject name type on success, one of the enumerated gnutls_x509_subject_alt_name_t.  It will return GNUTLS_E_SHORT_MEMORY_BUFFER if  ret_size is  not  large  enough  to  hold  the
       value.   In  that  case   ret_size  will  be  updated  with  the  required size.  If the certificate request does not have an Alternative name with the specified sequence number then GNUTLS_E_RE‐
       QUESTED_DATA_NOT_AVAILABLE is returned.

SINCE
       2.8.0
