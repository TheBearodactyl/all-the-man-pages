BIO_F_NULL(3ssl)                    OpenSSL                   BIO_F_NULL(3ssl)

NAME
       BIO_f_null - null filter

SYNOPSIS
        #include <openssl/bio.h>

        const BIO_METHOD *BIO_f_null(void);

DESCRIPTION
       BIO_f_null() returns the null filter BIO method. This is a filter BIO
       that does nothing.

       All requests to a null filter BIO are passed through to the next BIO in
       the chain: this means that a BIO chain containing a null filter BIO
       behaves just as though the BIO was not there.

NOTES
       As may be apparent a null filter BIO is not particularly useful.

RETURN VALUES
       BIO_f_null() returns the null filter BIO method.
