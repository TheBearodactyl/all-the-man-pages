NAME
       ares_parse_uri_reply - Parse a reply to a DNS query of type URI

SYNOPSIS
       #include <ares.h>

       int ares_parse_uri_reply(const unsigned char* abuf, int alen,
                                struct ares_uri_reply** uri_out);

DESCRIPTION
       The  ares_parse_uri_reply  function parses the response to a query of type URI into a linked list of struct ares_uri_reply The parameters abuf and alen give the contents of the response.  The re‚Äê
       sult is stored in allocated memory and a pointer to it stored into the variable pointed to by uri_out.  It is the caller's responsibility to free the resulting uri_out structure  when  it  is  no
       longer needed using the function ares_free_data

       The structure ares_uri_reply contains the following fields:

           struct ares_uri_reply {
               struct ares_uri_reply       *next;
               unsigned short              weight;
               unsigned short              priority;
               char                        *uri;
               int                         ttl;
           };

RETURN VALUES
       ares_parse_uri_reply can return any of the following values:

       ARES_SUCCESS   The response was successfully parsed.

       ARES_EBADRESP  The response was malformatted.

       ARES_ENODATA   The response did not contain an answer to the query.
