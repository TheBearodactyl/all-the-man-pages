OPENSSL_CONFIG(3ssl)                OpenSSL               OPENSSL_CONFIG(3ssl)

NAME
       OPENSSL_config, OPENSSL_no_config - simple OpenSSL configuration
       functions

SYNOPSIS
        #include <openssl/conf.h>

       The following functions have been deprecated since OpenSSL 1.1.0, and
       can be hidden entirely by defining OPENSSL_API_COMPAT with a suitable
       version value, see openssl_user_macros(7):

        void OPENSSL_config(const char *appname);
        void OPENSSL_no_config(void);

DESCRIPTION
       OPENSSL_config() configures OpenSSL using the standard openssl.cnf and
       reads from the application section appname. If appname is NULL then the
       default section, openssl_conf, will be used.  Errors are silently
       ignored.  Multiple calls have no effect.

       OPENSSL_no_config() disables configuration. If called before
       OPENSSL_config() no configuration takes place.

       If the application is built with OPENSSL_LOAD_CONF defined, then a call
       to OpenSSL_add_all_algorithms() will implicitly call OPENSSL_config()
       first.

NOTES
       The OPENSSL_config() function is designed to be a very simple "call it
       and forget it" function.  It is however much better than nothing.
       Applications which need finer control over their configuration
       functionality should use the configuration functions such as
       CONF_modules_load() directly. This function is deprecated and its use
       should be avoided.  Applications should instead call
       CONF_modules_load() during initialization (that is before starting any
       threads).

       There are several reasons why calling the OpenSSL configuration
       routines is advisable. For example, to load dynamic ENGINEs from shared
       libraries (DSOs).  However, very few applications currently support the
       control interface and so very few can load and use dynamic ENGINEs.
       Equally in future more sophisticated ENGINEs will require certain
       control operations to customize them. If an application calls
       OPENSSL_config() it doesn't need to know or care about ENGINE control
       operations because they can be performed by editing a configuration
       file.

ENVIRONMENT
       OPENSSL_CONF
           The path to the config file.  Ignored in set-user-ID and set-group-
           ID programs.

RETURN VALUES
       Neither OPENSSL_config() nor OPENSSL_no_config() return a value.

SEE ALSO
       config(5), CONF_modules_load_file(3)

HISTORY
       The OPENSSL_no_config() and OPENSSL_config() functions were deprecated
       in OpenSSL 1.1.0 by OPENSSL_init_crypto().
