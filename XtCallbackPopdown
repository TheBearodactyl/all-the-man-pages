NAME
       XtPopdown, XtCallbackPopdown - unmap a pop-up

SYNTAX
       #include <X11/Intrinsic.h>

       void XtPopdown(Widget popup_shell);

       void XtCallbackPopdown(Widget w, XtPointer client_data, XtPointer call_data);

ACTIONS
       void XtMenuPopdown(String shell_name);

ARGUMENTS
       call_data Specifies the callback data, which is not used by this procedure.

       client_data
                 Specifies a pointer to the XtPopdownID structure.

       popup_shell
                 Specifies the widget shell to pop down.

       shell_name
                 Specifies the name of the widget shell to pop down.

       w         Specifies the widget.

DESCRIPTION
       The XtPopdown function performs the following:

       •    Calls XtCheckSubclass to ensure popup_shell is a subclass of Shell.

       •    Checks that popup_shell is currently popped_up; otherwise, it generates an error.

       •    Unmaps popup_shell's window.

       •    If popup_shell's grab_kind is either XtGrabNonexclusive or XtGrabExclusive, it calls XtRemoveGrab.

       •    Sets pop-up shell's popped_up field to False.

       •    Calls the callback procedures on the shell's popdown_callback list.

       The XtCallbackPopdown function casts the client data parameter to an XtPopdownID pointer:

              typedef struct {
                      Widget shell_widget;
                      Widget enable_widget;
              } XtPopdownIDRec, *XtPopdownID;

       The shell_widget is the pop-up shell to pop down, and the enable_widget is the widget that was used to pop it up.

       XtCallbackPopdown calls XtPopdown with the specified shell_widget and then calls XtSetSensitive to resensitize the enable_widget.

       If a shell name is not given, XtMenuPopdown calls XtPopdown with the widget for which the translation is specified.  If a shell_name is specified in the translation table, XtMenuPopdown tries to
       find the shell by looking up the widget tree starting at the parent of the widget in which it is invoked.  If it finds a shell with the specified name in the pop-up children of that parent, it
       pops down the shell; otherwise, it moves up the parent chain as needed.  If XtMenuPopdown gets to the application top-level shell widget and cannot find a matching shell, it generates an error.
