NAME
       keyctl_move - Move a key between keyrings

SYNOPSIS
       #include <keyutils.h>

       long keyctl_move(key_serial_t key, key_serial_t from_keyring,
                        key_serial_t to_keyring, unsigned int flags);

DESCRIPTION
       keyctl_move() atomically unlinks key from from_keyring and links it into to_keyring in a single operation.  Depending on the flags set, a link to any matching key in to_keyring may get displaced.

       flags is a bitwise-OR of zero or more of the following flags:

       KEYCTL_MOVE_EXCL
              If there's a matching key in to_keyring, don't displace it but rather return an error.

       The caller must have write permission on both keyring to be able to create or remove links in them.

       The caller must have link permission on a key to be able to create a new link to it.

RETURN VALUE
       On success keyctl_move() return 0.  On error, the value -1 will be returned and errno will have been set to an appropriate error.

ERRORS
       ENOKEY The key or one of the keyrings specified are invalid.

       ENOKEY A key with the same type and description is present in to_keyring and KEYCTL_MOVE_EXCL is set.

       EKEYEXPIRED
              The key or one of the keyrings specified have expired.

       EKEYREVOKED
              The key or one of the keyrings specified have been revoked.

       EACCES The key exists, but is not linkable by the calling process.

       EACCES The keyrings exist, but are not writable by the calling process.

       ENOMEM Insufficient memory to effect the changes.

       EDQUOT Expanding to_keyring would exceed the keyring owner's quota.

LINKING
       This is a library function that can be found in libkeyutils.  When linking, -lkeyutils should be specified to the linker.
