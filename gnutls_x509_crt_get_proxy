NAME
       gnutls_x509_crt_get_proxy - API function

SYNOPSIS
       #include <gnutls/x509.h>

       int gnutls_x509_crt_get_proxy(gnutls_x509_crt_t cert, unsigned int * critical, int * pathlen, char ** policyLanguage, char ** policy, size_t * sizeof_policy);

ARGUMENTS
       gnutls_x509_crt_t cert
                   should contain a gnutls_x509_crt_t type

       unsigned int * critical
                   will be non-zero if the extension is marked as critical

       int * pathlen
                   pointer  to output integer indicating path length (may be NULL), non-negative error codes indicate a present pCPathLenConstraint field and the actual value, -1 indicate that the field
                   is absent.

       char ** policyLanguage
                   output variable with OID of policy language

       char ** policy
                   output variable with policy data

       size_t * sizeof_policy
                   output variable size of policy data

DESCRIPTION
       This function will get information from a proxy certificate.  It reads the ProxyCertInfo X.509 extension (1.3.6.1.5.5.7.1.14).

RETURNS
       On success, GNUTLS_E_SUCCESS (0) is returned, otherwise a negative error code is returned.
