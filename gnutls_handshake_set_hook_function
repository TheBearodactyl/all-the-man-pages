NAME
       gnutls_handshake_set_hook_function - API function

SYNOPSIS
       #include <gnutls/gnutls.h>

       void gnutls_handshake_set_hook_function(gnutls_session_t session, unsigned int htype, int when, gnutls_handshake_hook_func func);

ARGUMENTS
       gnutls_session_t session
                   is a gnutls_session_t type

       unsigned int htype
                   the gnutls_handshake_description_t of the message to hook at

       int when    GNUTLS_HOOK_* depending on when the hook function should be called

       gnutls_handshake_hook_func func
                   is the function to be called

DESCRIPTION
       This   function   will  set  a  callback  to  be  called  after  or  before  the  specified  handshake  message  has  been  received  or  generated.  This  is  a  generalization  of  gnutls_hand‐
       shake_set_post_client_hello_function().

       To call the hook function prior to the message being generated or processed use GNUTLS_HOOK_PRE as  when parameter, GNUTLS_HOOK_POST to call after, and GNUTLS_HOOK_BOTH for both cases.

       This callback must return 0 on success or a gnutls error code to terminate the handshake.

       To hook at all handshake messages use an  htype of GNUTLS_HANDSHAKE_ANY.

WARNING
       You should not use this function to terminate the handshake based on client input unless you know what you are doing. Before the handshake is finished there is no  way  to  know  if  there  is  a
       man-in-the-middle attack being performed.
