NAME
       gnutls_x509_privkey_import2 - API function

SYNOPSIS
       #include <gnutls/x509.h>

       int gnutls_x509_privkey_import2(gnutls_x509_privkey_t key, const gnutls_datum_t * data, gnutls_x509_crt_fmt_t format, const char * password, unsigned int flags);

ARGUMENTS
       gnutls_x509_privkey_t key
                   The data to store the parsed key

       const gnutls_datum_t * data
                   The DER or PEM encoded key.

       gnutls_x509_crt_fmt_t format
                   One of DER or PEM

       const char * password
                   A password (optional)

       unsigned int flags
                   an ORed sequence of gnutls_pkcs_encrypt_flags_t

DESCRIPTION
       This function will import the given DER or PEM encoded key, to the native gnutls_x509_privkey_t format, irrespective of the input format. The input format is auto-detected.

       The supported formats are basic unencrypted key, PKCS8, PKCS12, and the openssl format.

       If the provided key is encrypted but no password was given, then GNUTLS_E_DECRYPTION_FAILED is returned. Since GnuTLS 3.4.0 this function will utilize the PIN callbacks if any.

RETURNS
       On success, GNUTLS_E_SUCCESS (0) is returned, otherwise a negative error value.
