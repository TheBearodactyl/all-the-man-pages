NAME
       gnutls_pubkey_verify_hash2 - API function

SYNOPSIS
       #include <gnutls/abstract.h>

       int gnutls_pubkey_verify_hash2(gnutls_pubkey_t key, gnutls_sign_algorithm_t algo, unsigned int flags, const gnutls_datum_t * hash, const gnutls_datum_t * signature);

ARGUMENTS
       gnutls_pubkey_t key
                   Holds the public key

       gnutls_sign_algorithm_t algo
                   The signature algorithm used

       unsigned int flags
                   Zero or an OR list of gnutls_certificate_verify_flags

       const gnutls_datum_t * hash
                   holds the hash digest to be verified

       const gnutls_datum_t * signature
                   contains the signature

DESCRIPTION
       This  function will verify the given signed digest, using the parameters from the public key. Note that unlike gnutls_privkey_sign_hash(), this function accepts a signature algorithm instead of a
       digest algorithm.  You can use gnutls_pk_to_sign() to get the appropriate value.

RETURNS
       In case of a verification failure GNUTLS_E_PK_SIG_VERIFY_FAILED is returned, and zero or positive code on success. For known to be insecure signatures this function will return  GNUTLS_E_INSUFFI‐
       CIENT_SECURITY unless the flag GNUTLS_VERIFY_ALLOW_BROKEN is specified.

SINCE
       3.0
