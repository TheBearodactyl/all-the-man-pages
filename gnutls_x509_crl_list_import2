NAME
       gnutls_x509_crl_list_import2 - API function

SYNOPSIS
       #include <gnutls/x509.h>

       int gnutls_x509_crl_list_import2(gnutls_x509_crl_t ** crls, unsigned int * size, const gnutls_datum_t * data, gnutls_x509_crt_fmt_t format, unsigned int flags);

ARGUMENTS
       gnutls_x509_crl_t ** crls
                   Will contain the parsed crl list.

       unsigned int * size
                   It will contain the size of the list.

       const gnutls_datum_t * data
                   The PEM encoded CRL.

       gnutls_x509_crt_fmt_t format
                   One of DER or PEM.

       unsigned int flags

DESCRIPTION
       This function will convert the given PEM encoded CRL list to the native gnutls_x509_crl_t format. The output will be stored in  crls .  They will be automatically initialized.

       If the Certificate is PEM encoded it should have a header of "X509 CRL".

RETURNS
