NAME
       gnutls_pkcs11_init - API function

SYNOPSIS
       #include <gnutls/pkcs11.h>

       int gnutls_pkcs11_init(unsigned int flags, const char * deprecated_config_file);

ARGUMENTS
       unsigned int flags
                   An ORed sequence of GNUTLS_PKCS11_FLAG_*

       const char * deprecated_config_file
                   either NULL or the location of a deprecated configuration file

DESCRIPTION
       This  function  will  initialize  the  PKCS  11  subsystem  in gnutls. It will read configuration files if GNUTLS_PKCS11_FLAG_AUTO is used or allow you to independently load PKCS 11 modules using
       gnutls_pkcs11_add_provider() if GNUTLS_PKCS11_FLAG_MANUAL is specified.

       You don't need to call this function since GnuTLS 3.3.0 because it is being called during the first request PKCS 11 operation. That call will assume the GNUTLS_PKCS11_FLAG_AUTO flag.  If  another
       flags are required then it must be called independently prior to any PKCS 11 operation.

RETURNS
       On success, GNUTLS_E_SUCCESS (0) is returned, otherwise a negative error value.

SINCE
       2.12.0
