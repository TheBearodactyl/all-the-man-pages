UNW_GET_ACCESSORS(3)                                                                       Programming Library                                                                        UNW_GET_ACCESSORS(3)

NAME
       unw_get_accessors -- get pointer to accessor call-backs

SYNOPSIS
       #include <libunwind.h>

       unw_accessors_t *unw_get_accessors(unw_addr_space_t as);

DESCRIPTION
       The  unw_get_accessors()  routine  returns  a  pointer  to  a  unw_accessors_t structure, which contains the call-back routines that were specified when address space as was created (see unw_cre‚Äê
       ate_addr_space(3)).  The returned pointer is guaranteed to remain valid until address space as is destroyed by a call to unw_destroy_addr_space(3).

       Note that unw_get_accessors() can be used to retrieve the call-back routines for the local address space unw_local_addr_space.

RETURN VALUE
       The unw_get_accessors() routine cannot fail and always returns a valid (non-NULL) pointer to an unw_accessors_t structure.

THREAD AND SIGNAL SAFETY
       The unw_get_accessors() routine is thread-safe as well as safe to use from a signal handler.
