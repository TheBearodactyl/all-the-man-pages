NAME
       ldns_dname_compare, ldns_dname_interval - compare two dnames

SYNOPSIS
       #include <stdint.h>
       #include <stdbool.h>

       #include <ldns/ldns.h>

       int ldns_dname_compare(const ldns_rdf *dname1, const ldns_rdf *dname2);

       int ldns_dname_interval(const ldns_rdf *prev, const ldns_rdf *middle, const ldns_rdf *next);

DESCRIPTION
       ldns_dname_compare() Compares the two dname rdf's according to the algorithm for ordering in RFC4034 Section 6.
              dname1: First dname rdf to compare
              dname2: Second dname rdf to compare
              Returns -1 if dname1 comes before dname2, 1 if dname1 comes after dname2, and 0 if they are equal.

       ldns_dname_interval() check if middle lays in the interval defined by prev and next prev <= middle < next. This is useful for nsec checking
              prev: the previous dname
              middle: the dname to check
              next: the next dname return 0 on error or unknown, -1 when middle is in the interval, +1 when not
