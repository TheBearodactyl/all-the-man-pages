NAME
       gnutls_x509_crq_set_dn_by_oid - API function

SYNOPSIS
       #include <gnutls/x509.h>

       int gnutls_x509_crq_set_dn_by_oid(gnutls_x509_crq_t crq, const char * oid, unsigned int raw_flag, const void * data, unsigned int sizeof_data);

ARGUMENTS
       gnutls_x509_crq_t crq
                   should contain a gnutls_x509_crq_t type

       const char * oid
                   holds an Object Identifier in a (0)-terminated string

       unsigned int raw_flag
                   must be 0, or 1 if the data are DER encoded

       const void * data
                   a pointer to the input data

       unsigned int sizeof_data
                   holds the size of  data

DESCRIPTION
       This function will set the part of the name of the Certificate request subject, specified by the given OID.  The input string should be ASCII or UTF-8 encoded.

       Some  helper  macros  with  popular OIDs can be found in gnutls/x509.h With this function you can only set the known OIDs.  You can test for known OIDs using gnutls_x509_dn_oid_known().  For OIDs
       that are not known (by gnutls) you should properly DER encode your data, and call this function with raw_flag set.

RETURNS
       On success, GNUTLS_E_SUCCESS (0) is returned, otherwise a negative error value.
