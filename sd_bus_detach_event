SD_BUS_ATTACH_EVENT(3)        sd_bus_attach_event       SD_BUS_ATTACH_EVENT(3)

NAME
       sd_bus_attach_event, sd_bus_detach_event, sd_bus_get_event - Attach a
       bus connection object to an event loop

SYNOPSIS
       #include <systemd/sd-bus.h>

       int sd_bus_attach_event(sd_bus *bus, sd_event *e, int priority);

       int sd_bus_detach_event(sd_bus *bus);

       sd_event *sd_bus_get_event(sd_bus *bus);

DESCRIPTION
       sd_bus_attach_event() attaches the specified bus connection object to
       an sd-event(3) event loop object at the specified priority (see
       sd_event_source_set_priority(3) for details on event loop priorities).
       When a bus connection object is attached to an event loop incoming
       messages will be automatically read and processed, and outgoing
       messages written, whenever the event loop is run. When the event loop
       is about to terminate, the bus connection is automatically flushed and
       closed (see sd_bus_set_close_on_exit(3) for details on this). By
       default bus connection objects are not attached to any event loop. When
       a bus connection object is attached to one it is not necessary to
       invoke sd_bus_wait(3) or sd_bus_process(3) as this functionality is
       handled automatically by the event loop.

       sd_bus_detach_event() detaches a bus object from its event loop.

       The sd_bus_get_event() returns the event loop object the specified bus
       object is currently attached to, or NULL if it is currently not
       attached to any.

       Note that sd_bus_attach_event() is only one of three supported ways to
       implement I/O event handling for bus connections. Alternatively use
       sd_bus_get_fd(3) for hooking up a bus connection object with external
       or manual event loops. Or use sd_bus_wait(3) as a simple synchronous,
       blocking I/O waiting call.

RETURN VALUE
       On success, sd_bus_attach_event() and sd_bus_detach_event() return 0 or
       a positive integer. On failure, they return a negative errno-style
       error code.

       sd_bus_get_event() returns an event loop object or NULL.

   Errors
       Returned errors may indicate the following problems:

       -ECHILD
           The bus connection has been created in a different process.

NOTES
       These APIs are implemented as a shared library, which can be compiled
       and linked to with the libsystemd pkg-config(1) file.
