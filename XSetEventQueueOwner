NAME
       XSetEventQueueOwner - set event queue owner on a shared Xlib/XCB connection

SYNTAX

               #include <X11/Xlib-xcb.h>

       void XSetEventQueueOwner(Display *dpy, enum XEventQueueOwner owner);

ARGUMENTS
       dpy       Specifies the connection to the X server.

       owner     Specifies the event queue ownership:

                 XlibOwnsEventQueue (default)
                        Xlib owns the event queue.  Use the Xlib event-handling functions.  Do not call the XCB event-handling functions.

                 XCBOwnsEventQueue
                        XCB owns the event queue.  Use the XCB event-handling functions.  Do not call the Xlib event-handling functions.

DESCRIPTION
       While  a  client  using  Xlib/XCB  can issue requests and handle their replies or errors with either Xlib or XCB, only one can own and handle the event queue.  By default, Xlib must own the event
       queue, for compatibility with legacy Xlib clients.  Clients can call XSetEventQueueOwner immediately after XOpenDisplay to let XCB own the event queue instead.  Clients  may  not  call  XSetEven‚Äê
       tQueueOwner at any other time, as this will potentially lose responses.
