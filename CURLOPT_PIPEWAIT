NAME
       CURLOPT_PIPEWAIT - wait for pipelining/multiplexing

SYNOPSIS
       #include <curl/curl.h>

       CURLcode curl_easy_setopt(CURL *handle, CURLOPT_PIPEWAIT, long wait);

DESCRIPTION
       Set wait to 1L to tell libcurl to prefer to wait for a connection to confirm or deny that it can do pipelining or multiplexing before continuing.

       When  about  to  perform a new transfer that allows pipelining or multiplexing, libcurl will check for existing connections to re-use and pipeline on. If no such connection exists it will immedi‚Äê
       ately continue and create a fresh new connection to use.

       By setting this option to 1 - and having CURLMOPT_PIPELINING(3) enabled for the multi handle this transfer is associated with - libcurl will instead wait for the connection to  reveal  if  it  is
       possible to pipeline/multiplex on before it continues. This enables libcurl to much better keep the number of connections to a minimum when using pipelining or multiplexing protocols.

       The  effect  thus becomes that with this option set, libcurl prefers to wait and re-use an existing connection for pipelining rather than the opposite: prefer to open a new connection rather than
       waiting.

       The waiting time is as long as it takes for the connection to get up and for libcurl to get the necessary response back that informs it about its protocol and support level.

DEFAULT
       0 (off)

PROTOCOLS
       HTTP(S)

EXAMPLE
       CURL *curl = curl_easy_init();
       if(curl) {
         curl_easy_setopt(curl, CURLOPT_URL, "https://example.com/");
         curl_easy_setopt(curl, CURLOPT_PIPEWAIT, 1L);

         /* now add this easy handle to the multi handle */
       }

AVAILABILITY
       Added in 7.43.0

RETURN VALUE
       Returns CURLE_OK if the option is supported, and CURLE_UNKNOWN_OPTION if not.
