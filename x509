       commands

SYNOPSIS
       openssl cmd -help | [-option | -option arg] ... [arg] ...

DESCRIPTION
       Every cmd listed above is a (sub-)command of the openssl(1) application.  It has its own detailed manual page at openssl-cmd(1). For example, to view the manual page for the openssl dgst command,
       type "man openssl-dgst".

OPTIONS
       Among others, every subcommand has a help option.

       -help
           Print out a usage message for the subcommand.

HISTORY
       Initially, the manual page entry for the "openssl cmd" command used to be available at cmd(1). Later, the alias openssl-cmd(1) was introduced, which made it easier to group the openssl commands
       using the apropos(1) command or the shell's tab completion.

       In order to reduce cluttering of the global manual page namespace, the manual page entries without the 'openssl-' prefix have been deprecated in OpenSSL 3.0 and will be removed in OpenSSL 4.0.

NAME
       x509 - X.509 certificate handling

SYNOPSIS
        #include <openssl/x509.h>

DESCRIPTION
       An X.509 certificate is a structured grouping of information about an individual, a device, or anything one can imagine.  An X.509 CRL (certificate revocation list) is a tool to help determine if
       a certificate is still valid.  The exact definition of those can be found in the X.509 document from ITU-T, or in RFC3280 from PKIX.  In OpenSSL, the type X509 is used to express such a
       certificate, and the type X509_CRL is used to express a CRL.

       A related structure is a certificate request, defined in PKCS#10 from RSA Security, Inc, also reflected in RFC2896.  In OpenSSL, the type X509_REQ is used to express such a certificate request.

       To handle some complex parts of a certificate, there are the types X509_NAME (to express a certificate name), X509_ATTRIBUTE (to express a certificate attribute), X509_EXTENSION (to express a
       certificate extension) and a few more.

       Finally, there's the supertype X509_INFO, which can contain a CRL, a certificate and a corresponding private key.

       X509_XXX, d2i_X509_XXX, and i2d_X509_XXX functions handle X.509 certificates, with some exceptions, shown below.

       X509_CRL_XXX, d2i_X509_CRL_XXX, and i2d_X509_CRL_XXX functions handle X.509 CRLs.

       X509_REQ_XXX, d2i_X509_REQ_XXX, and i2d_X509_REQ_XXX functions handle PKCS#10 certificate requests.

       X509_NAME_XXX functions handle certificate names.

       X509_ATTRIBUTE_XXX functions handle certificate attributes.

       X509_EXTENSION_XXX functions handle certificate extensions.
