NAME
       gnutls_system_key_iter_get_info - API function

SYNOPSIS
       #include <gnutls/system-keys.h>

       int gnutls_system_key_iter_get_info(gnutls_system_key_iter_t * iter, unsigned cert_type, char ** cert_url, char ** key_url, char ** label, gnutls_datum_t * der, unsigned int flags);

ARGUMENTS
       gnutls_system_key_iter_t * iter
                   an iterator of the system keys (must be set to NULL initially)

       unsigned cert_type
                   A value of gnutls_certificate_type_t which indicates the type of certificate to look for

       char ** cert_url
                   The certificate URL of the pair (may be NULL)

       char ** key_url
                   The key URL of the pair (may be NULL)

       char ** label
                   The friendly name (if any) of the pair (may be NULL)

       gnutls_datum_t * der
                   if non-NULL the DER data of the certificate

       unsigned int flags
                   should be zero

DESCRIPTION
       This  function  will  return  on each call a certificate and key pair URLs, as well as a label associated with them, and the DER-encoded certificate. When the iteration is complete it will return
       GNUTLS_E_REQUESTED_DATA_NOT_AVAILABLE.

       Typically  cert_type should be GNUTLS_CRT_X509.

       All values set are allocated and must be cleared using gnutls_free(),

RETURNS
       On success, GNUTLS_E_SUCCESS (0) is returned, otherwise a negative error value.

SINCE
       3.4.0
