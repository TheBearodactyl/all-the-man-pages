NAME
       SelectSaver - save and restore selected file handle

SYNOPSIS
           use SelectSaver;

           {
              my $saver = SelectSaver->new(FILEHANDLE);
              # FILEHANDLE is selected
           }
           # previous handle is selected

           {
              my $saver = SelectSaver->new;
              # new handle may be selected, or not
           }
           # previous handle is selected

DESCRIPTION
       A "SelectSaver" object contains a reference to the file handle that was
       selected when it was created.  If its "new" method gets an extra
       parameter, then that parameter is selected; otherwise, the selected
       file handle remains unchanged.

       When a "SelectSaver" is destroyed, it re-selects the file handle that
       was selected when it was created.
