NAME
       gnutls_pkcs11_privkey_init - API function

SYNOPSIS
       #include <gnutls/pkcs11.h>

       int gnutls_pkcs11_privkey_init(gnutls_pkcs11_privkey_t * key);

ARGUMENTS
       gnutls_pkcs11_privkey_t * key
                   A pointer to the type to be initialized

DESCRIPTION
       This function will initialize an private key structure. This structure can be used for accessing an underlying PKCS11 object.

       In versions of GnuTLS later than 3.5.11 the object is protected using locks and a single gnutls_pkcs11_privkey_t can be re-used by many threads. However, for performance it is recommended to uti‐
       lize one object per key per thread.

RETURNS
       On success, GNUTLS_E_SUCCESS (0) is returned, otherwise a negative error value.
