NAME
       CURLOPT_PROXYUSERPWD - user name and password to use for proxy authentication

SYNOPSIS
       #include <curl/curl.h>

       CURLcode curl_easy_setopt(CURL *handle, CURLOPT_PROXYUSERPWD, char *userpwd);

DESCRIPTION
       Pass  a  char  * as parameter, which should be [user name]:[password] to use for the connection to the HTTP proxy. Both the name and the password will be URL decoded before use, so to include for
       example a colon in the user name you should encode it as %3A. (This is different to how CURLOPT_USERPWD(3) is used - beware.)

       Use CURLOPT_PROXYAUTH(3) to specify the authentication method.

       The application does not have to keep the string around after setting this option.

DEFAULT
       This is NULL by default.

PROTOCOLS
       Used with all protocols that can use a proxy

EXAMPLE
       CURL *curl = curl_easy_init();
       if(curl) {
         curl_easy_setopt(curl, CURLOPT_URL, "https://example.com/foo.bin");
         curl_easy_setopt(curl, CURLOPT_PROXY, "http://localhost:8080");
         curl_easy_setopt(curl, CURLOPT_PROXYUSERPWD, "clark%20kent:superman");
         ret = curl_easy_perform(curl);
         curl_easy_cleanup(curl);
       }

AVAILABILITY
       Always

RETURN VALUE
       Returns CURLE_OK if proxies are supported, CURLE_UNKNOWN_OPTION if not, or CURLE_OUT_OF_MEMORY if there was insufficient heap space.
