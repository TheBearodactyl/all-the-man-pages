NAME
       ostree-diff - Compare a directory against a revision

SYNOPSIS
       ostree diff [OPTIONS...] {REV_OR_DIR} {REV_OR_DIR}

DESCRIPTION
       Compare a directory or revision against another directory or revision.
       If REV_OR_DIR starts with `/` or `./`, it is interpreted as a
       directory, otherwise a revision. Shows files and directories modified,
       added, and deleted. If there is a file in the second REV_OR_DIR not in
       the first, it will show with an "A" for "added". If a file in the first
       REV_OR_DIR is not in the second, it shows "D" for "deleted". "M" for
       "modified" will also show.
