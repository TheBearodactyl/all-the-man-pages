NAME
       gnutls_sec_param_to_pk_bits - API function

SYNOPSIS
       #include <gnutls/gnutls.h>

       unsigned int gnutls_sec_param_to_pk_bits(gnutls_pk_algorithm_t algo, gnutls_sec_param_t param);

ARGUMENTS
       gnutls_pk_algorithm_t algo
                   is a public key algorithm

       gnutls_sec_param_t param
                   is a security parameter

DESCRIPTION
       When  generating private and public key pairs a difficult question is which size of "bits" the modulus will be in RSA and the group size in DSA. The easy answer is 1024, which is also wrong. This
       function will convert a human understandable security parameter to an appropriate size for the specific algorithm.

RETURNS
       The number of bits, or (0).

SINCE
       2.12.0
