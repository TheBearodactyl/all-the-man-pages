   int LIBMTP_Get_Track_To_File (LIBMTP_mtpdevice_t * device, uint32_t const id, char const *const path, LIBMTP_progressfunc_t const callback, void const *const data)
       This gets a track off the device to a file identified by a filename. This is actually just a wrapper for the LIBMTP_Get_Track_To_File() function.

       Parameters
           device a pointer to the device to get the track from.
           id the track ID of the track to retrieve.
           path a filename to use for the retrieved track.
           callback a progress indicator function or NULL to ignore.
           data a user-defined pointer that is passed along to the progress function in order to pass along some user defined data to the progress updates. If not used, set this to NULL.

       Returns
           0 if the transfer was successful, any other value means failure.

   LIBMTP_track_t * LIBMTP_Get_Tracklisting_With_Callback (LIBMTP_mtpdevice_t * device, LIBMTP_progressfunc_t const callback, void const *const data)
       This returns a long list of all tracks available on the current MTP device. Tracks include multimedia objects, both music tracks and video tracks. Typical usage:

       LIBMTP_track_t *tracklist;

       tracklist = LIBMTP_Get_Tracklisting_With_Callback(device, callback, data);
       while (tracklist != NULL) {
         LIBMTP_track_t *tmp;

         // Do something on each element in the list here...
         tmp = tracklist;
         tracklist = tracklist->next;
         LIBMTP_destroy_track_t(tmp);
       }

       If you want to group your track listing by storage (per storage unit) or arrange tracks into folders, you must dereference the storage_id and/or parent_id field of the returned LIBMTP_track_t
       struct. To arrange by folders or files you typically have to create the proper trees by calls to LIBMTP_Get_Storage() and/or LIBMTP_Get_Folder_List() first.

       Parameters
           device a pointer to the device to get the track listing for.
           callback a function to be called during the tracklisting retrieveal for displaying progress bars etc, or NULL if you don't want any callbacks.
           data a user-defined pointer that is passed along to the progress function in order to pass along some user defined data to the progress updates. If not used, set this to NULL.

       Returns
           a list of tracks that can be followed using the next field of the LIBMTP_track_t data structure. Each of the metadata tags must be freed after use, and may contain only partial metadata
           information, i.e. one or several fields may be NULL or 0.

   LIBMTP_track_t * LIBMTP_Get_Trackmetadata (LIBMTP_mtpdevice_t * device, uint32_t const trackid)
       This function retrieves the metadata for a single track off the device.

       Do not call this function repeatedly! The track handles are linearly searched O(n) and the call may involve (slow) USB traffic, so use LIBMTP_Get_Tracklisting() and cache the tracks, preferably
       as an efficient data structure such as a hash list.

       Parameters
           device a pointer to the device to get the track metadata from.
           trackid the object ID of the track that you want the metadata for.

       Returns
           a track metadata entry on success or NULL on failure.

   LIBMTP_track_t * LIBMTP_new_track_t (void)
       This creates a new track metadata structure and allocates memory for it. Notice that if you add strings to this structure they will be freed by the corresponding LIBMTP_destroy_track_t operation
       later, so be careful of using strdup() when assigning strings, e.g.:

       LIBMTP_track_t *track = LIBMTP_new_track_t();
       track->title = strdup(titlestr);
       ....
       LIBMTP_destroy_track_t(track);

       Returns
           a pointer to the newly allocated metadata structure.

   int LIBMTP_Send_Track_From_File (LIBMTP_mtpdevice_t * device, char const *const path, LIBMTP_track_t *const metadata, LIBMTP_progressfunc_t const callback, void const *const data)
       This function sends a track from a local file to an MTP device. A filename and a set of metadata must be given as input.

       Parameters
           device a pointer to the device to send the track to.
           path the filename of a local file which will be sent.
           metadata a track metadata set to be written along with the file. After this call the field metadata->item_id will contain the new track ID. Other fields such as the metadata->filename,
           metadata->parent_id or metadata->storage_id may also change during this operation due to device restrictions, so do not rely on the contents of this struct to be preserved in any way.

           • metadata->parent_id should be set to the parent (e.g. folder) to store this track in. Since some devices are a bit picky about where files are placed, a default folder will be chosen if
             libmtp has detected one for the current filetype and this parameter is set to 0. If this is 0 and no default folder can be found, the file will be stored in the root folder.
           • metadata->storage_id should be set to the desired storage (e.g. memory card or whatever your device presents) to store this track in. Setting this to 0 will store the track on the primary
             storage.
           callback a progress indicator function or NULL to ignore.
           data a user-defined pointer that is passed along to the progress function in order to pass along some user defined data to the progress updates. If not used, set this to NULL.
       Returns
           0 if the transfer was successful, any other value means failure.

   int LIBMTP_Set_Track_Name (LIBMTP_mtpdevice_t * device, LIBMTP_track_t * track, const char * newname)
       This function renames a single track. This simply means that the PTP_OPC_ObjectFileName property is updated, if this is supported by the device.
       Parameters
           device a pointer to the device that contains the file.
           track the track metadata of the track to rename. On success, the filename member is updated. Be aware, that this name can be different than newname depending of device restrictions.
           newname the new filename for this object.
       Returns
           0 on success, any other value means failure.
   int LIBMTP_Track_Exists (LIBMTP_mtpdevice_t * device, uint32_t const id)

       Parameters
           device a pointer to the device to get the track from.
           id the track ID of the track to retrieve.
       Returns
           TRUE (!=0) if the track exists, FALSE (0) if not

   int LIBMTP_Update_Track_Metadata (LIBMTP_mtpdevice_t * device, LIBMTP_track_t const *const metadata)
       This function updates the MTP track object metadata on a single file identified by an object ID.
       Parameters
           device a pointer to the device to update the track metadata on.
           metadata a track metadata set to be written to the file. notice that the track_id field of the metadata structure must be correct so that the function can update the right file. If some
           properties of this metadata are set to NULL (strings) or 0 (numerical values) they will be discarded and the track will not be tagged with these blank values.
       Returns
           0 on success, any other value means failure. If some or all of the properties fail to update we will still return success. On some devices (notably iRiver T30) properties that exist cannot be
           updated.
