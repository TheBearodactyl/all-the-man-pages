NAME
       gnutls_certificate_set_x509_simple_pkcs12_mem - API function

SYNOPSIS
       #include <gnutls/gnutls.h>

       int gnutls_certificate_set_x509_simple_pkcs12_mem(gnutls_certificate_credentials_t res, const gnutls_datum_t * p12blob, gnutls_x509_crt_fmt_t type, const char * password);

ARGUMENTS
       gnutls_certificate_credentials_t res
                   is a gnutls_certificate_credentials_t type.

       const gnutls_datum_t * p12blob
                   the PKCS12 blob.

       gnutls_x509_crt_fmt_t type
                   is PEM or DER of the  pkcs12file .

       const char * password
                   optional password used to decrypt PKCS12 file, bags and keys.

DESCRIPTION
       This  function sets a certificate/private key pair and/or a CRL in the gnutls_certificate_credentials_t type.  This function may be called more than once (in case multiple keys/certificates exist
       for the server).

       Encrypted PKCS12 bags and PKCS8 private keys are supported.  However, only password based security, and the same password for all operations, are supported.

       PKCS12 file may contain many keys and/or certificates, and this function will try to auto-detect based on the key ID the certificate and key pair to use. If the PKCS12 file contain the issuer  of
       the selected certificate, it will be appended to the certificate to form a chain.

       If more than one private keys are stored in the PKCS12 file, then only one key will be read (and it is undefined which one).

       It  is believed that the limitations of this function is acceptable for most usage, and that any more flexibility would introduce complexity that would make it harder to use this functionality at
       all.

       Note that, this function by default returns zero on success and a negative value on error.  Since 3.5.6, when the flag GNUTLS_CERTIFICATE_API_V2 is set using gnutls_certificate_set_flags() it re‐
       turns an index (greater or equal to zero). That index can be used to other functions to refer to the added key-pair.

RETURNS
       On success this functions returns zero, and otherwise a negative value on error (see above for modifying that behavior).

SINCE
       2.8.0
