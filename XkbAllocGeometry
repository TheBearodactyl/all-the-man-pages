NAME
       XkbAllocGeometry - Allocate an entire geometry

SYNOPSIS
       Status XkbAllocGeometry (XkbDescPtr xkb, XkbGeometrySizesPtr sizes);

ARGUMENTS
       xkb    keyboard description for which geometry is to be allocated

       sizes  initial sizes for all geometry components

DESCRIPTION
       Xkb  provides a number of functions to allocate and free subcomponents of a keyboard geometry. Use these functions to create or modify keyboard geometries.  Note that these functions merely allo‚Äê
       cate space for the new element(s), and it is up to you to fill in the values explicitly in your code. These allocation functions increase sz_* but never touch num_* (unless there is an allocation
       failure,  in which case they reset both sz_* and num_* to zero). These functions return Success if they succeed, BadAlloc if they are not able to allocate space, or BadValue if a parameter is not
       as expected.

       XkbAllocGeometry allocates a keyboard geometry and adds it to the keyboard description specified by xkb.  The keyboard description should be obtained via the  XkbGetKeyboard  or  XkbAllocKeyboard
       functions.  The sizes parameter specifies the number of elements to be reserved for the subcomponents of the keyboard geometry and can be zero or more. These subcomponents include the properties,
       colors, shapes, sections, and doodads.

       To free an entire geometry, use XkbFreeGeometry.

DIAGNOSTICS
       BadAlloc       Unable to allocate storage

       BadValue       An argument is out of range
