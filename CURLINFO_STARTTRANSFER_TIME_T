NAME
       CURLINFO_STARTTRANSFER_TIME_T - get the time until the first byte is received

SYNOPSIS
       #include <curl/curl.h>

       CURLcode curl_easy_getinfo(CURL *handle, CURLINFO_STARTTRANSFER_TIME_T,
                                  curl_off_t *timep);

DESCRIPTION
       Pass  a pointer to a curl_off_t to receive the time, in microseconds, it took from the start until the first byte is received by libcurl. This includes CURLINFO_PRETRANSFER_TIME_T(3) and also the
       time the server needs to calculate the result.

       When a redirect is followed, the time from each request is added together.

       See also the TIMES overview in the curl_easy_getinfo(3) man page.

PROTOCOLS
       All

EXAMPLE
       curl = curl_easy_init();
       if(curl) {
         curl_off_t start;
         curl_easy_setopt(curl, CURLOPT_URL, url);
         res = curl_easy_perform(curl);
         if(CURLE_OK == res) {
           res = curl_easy_getinfo(curl, CURLINFO_STARTTRANSFER_TIME_T, &start);
           if(CURLE_OK == res) {
             printf("Time: %" CURL_FORMAT_CURL_OFF_T ".%06ld", start / 1000000,
                    (long)(start % 1000000));
           }
         }
         /* always cleanup */
         curl_easy_cleanup(curl);
       }

AVAILABILITY

RETURN VALUE
       Returns CURLE_OK if the option is supported, and CURLE_UNKNOWN_OPTION if not.
