NAME
       XkbFreeGeomPoints - Free points in a outline

SYNOPSIS
       void XkbFreeGeomPoints (XkbOutlinePtr outline, int first, int count, Bool free_all);

ARGUMENTS
       outline
              outline in which points should be freed

       first  first point to be freed

       count  number of points to be freed

       free_all
              True => all points are freed

DESCRIPTION
       Xkb  provides a number of functions to allocate and free subcomponents of a keyboard geometry. Use these functions to create or modify keyboard geometries.  Note that these functions merely allo‐
       cate space for the new element(s), and it is up to you to fill in the values explicitly in your code. These allocation functions increase sz_* but never touch num_* (unless there is an allocation
       failure,  in which case they reset both sz_* and num_* to zero). These functions return Success if they succeed, BadAlloc if they are not able to allocate space, or BadValue if a parameter is not
       as expected.

       If free_all is True, all points are freed regardless of the value of >i first and count.  Otherwise, the number of points specified by count are freed, beginning with the point specified by first
       in the specified outline.

RETURN VALUES
       Success        The XkbFreeGeomPoints function returns Success when there are no allocation or argument errors.

DIAGNOSTICS
       BadAlloc       Unable to allocate storage

       BadValue       An argument is out of range
