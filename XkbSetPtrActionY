NAME
       XkbSetPtrActionY - Sets the high_YYY and low_YYY fields of act from the signed integer value y

SYNOPSIS
       void XkbSetPtrActionY (XkbPtrAction act, int y);

ARGUMENTS
       act    action in which to set Y

       y      new value to set

DESCRIPTION
       Actions associated with the XkbPtrAction structure move the pointer when keys are pressed and released.

       If the MouseKeys control is not enabled, KeyPress and KeyRelease events are treated as though the action is XkbSA_NoAction.

       If  the  MouseKeys control is enabled, a server action of type XkbSA_MovePtr instructs the server to generate core pointer MotionNotify events rather than the usual KeyPress event, and the corre‐
       sponding KeyRelease event disables any mouse keys timers that were created as a result of handling the XkbSA_MovePtr action.

       The type field of the XkbPtrAction structure is always XkbSA_MovePtr.

       The flags field is a bitwise inclusive OR of the masks shown in Table 1.

       XkbSA_NoAcceleration   If not set, and the MouseKeysAccel  con‐
                              trol  is enabled, the KeyPress initiates
                              a mouse keys timer for this  key;  every
                              time   the  timer  expires,  the  cursor
                              moves.
       XkbSA_MoveAbsoluteX    If set, the X portion of  the  structure
                              specifies  the new pointer X coordinate.
                              Otherwise, the X portion is added to the
                              current  pointer  X coordinate to deter‐
                              mine the new pointer X coordinate.
       XkbSA_MoveAbsoluteY    If set, the Y portion of  the  structure
                              specifies  the new pointer Y coordinate.
                              Otherwise, the Y portion is added to the
                              current  pointer  Y coordinate to deter‐
                              mine the new pointer Y coordinate.

       Each of the X and Y coordinates of the XkbPtrAction structure is composed of two signed 16-bit values, that is, the X coordinate is composed of high_XXX and low_XXX, and similarly for the Y coor‐
       dinate. Xkb provides the following macros, to convert between a signed integer and two signed 16-bit values in XkbPtrAction structures.
