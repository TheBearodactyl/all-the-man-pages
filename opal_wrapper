NAME
       opal_wrapper - Back-end Open MPI wrapper command

SYNOPSIS
       opal_wrapper [options]

DESCRIPTION
       opal_wrapper  is  not  meant  to be called directly by end users.  It is automatically invoked as the back-end by the Open MPI wrapper commands such as: mpicc, mpiCC, mpic++, and mpifort (and its
       legacy/deprecated names mpif77 and mpif90).

       Some Open MPI installations may have additional wrapper commands, and/or have renamed the wrapper compilers listed above to avoid executable name conflicts with other MPI implementations.  Hence,
       you  may  also  have wrapper compilers installed including the following names: mpifort.openmpi (and the legacy/deprecated names mpif90.openmpi and mpif77.openmpi), mpicxx.openmpi, mpiCC.openmpi,
       mpicc.openmpi, mpic++.openmpi, opalcc, opalc++, ortecc, and ortec++,

SEE ALSO
       The following may exist depending on your particular Open MPI installation: mpicc(1), mpiCC(1), mpic++(1), mpifort(1), mpifort.openmpi(1), mpicxx.openmpi(1),  mpiCC.openmpi(1),  mpicc.openmpi(1),
       mpic++.openmpi(1), ortecc(1), ortec++(1), opalccc(1), and the website at http://www.openmpi.org/.
