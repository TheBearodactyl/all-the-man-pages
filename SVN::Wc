NAME
       SVN::Wc - Subversion working copy functions

SYNOPSIS
       Incomplete

FUNCTIONS
       SVN::Wc::parse_externals_description3($parent_directory, $desc,
       $canonicalize_url, $pool);
           Parse the string $desc as an "svn:externals" value and return a
           reference to an array of _p_svn_wc_external_item2_t objects.  If
           $canonicalize_url is true, canonicalize the "url" member of those
           objects.  $parent_directory is only used in constructing error
           strings.

OBJECTS
   svn_wc_status2_t
       $wcstat->entry()
           A svn_wc_entry_t object for the item.  Can be undef if not under
           version control.

       $wcstat->text_status()
           An integer representing the status of the item's text.  Can be one
           of the $SVN::Wc::Status::* constants.

       $wcstat->prop_status()
           An integer representing the status of the item's properties.  Can
           be one of the $SVN::Wc::Status::* constants.

       $wcstat->locked()
           A boolean telling if the item is locked.  A directory can be locked
           if a working copy update was interrupted.

       $wcstat->copied()
           A boolean telling if the item was copied.  A file or directory can
           be copied if it's scheduled for addition-with-history (or part of a
           subtree that is scheduled as such).

       $wcstat->switched()
           A boolean telling if the item was switched.  A file or directory
           can be switched if the switch command has been used.

       $wcstat->repos_text_status()
           An integer representing the status of the item's text in the
           repository.  Can be one of the $SVN::Wc::Status::* constants.

       $wcstat->repos_prop_status()
           An integer representing the status of the item's properties in the
           repository.  Can be one of the $SVN::Wc::Status::* constants.

       $wcstat->repos_lock()
           A svn_lock_t object representing the entry's lock in the
           repository, if any.

       $wcstat->url()
           The url (actual or expected) of the item.

       $wcstat->ood_last_cmt_rev()
           An integer representing the youngest committed revision or
           $SVN::Core::INVALID_REVNUM is not out of date.

       $wcstat->ood_last_cmt_date()
           The date of the most recent commit as microseconds since 00:00:00
           January 1, 1970 UTC or 0 if not out of date.

       $wcstat->ood_kind()
           An integer representing the kind of the youngest commit.  Can be
           any of the $SVN::Node::* constants.  Will be $SVN::Node::none if
           not out of date.

       $wcstat->tree_conflict()
           A svn_wc_conflict_description_t object if the entry is the victim
           of a tree conflict or undef.

       $wcstat->file_external()
           A boolean telling if the item is a file that was added to the
           working copy as an svn:externals.  If file_external is TRUE, then
           switched is always FALSE.

       $wcstat->pristine_text_status()
           An integer representing the status of the item's text as compared
           to the pristine base of the file.  Can be one of the
           $SVN::Wc::Status::* constants.

       $wcstat->pristine_prop_status()
           An integer representing the status of the item's properties as
           compared to the pristine base of the node.  Can be one of the
           $SVN::Wc::Status::* constants.

   svn_wc_status_t
       Same as svn_wc_status2_t, but without the repos_lock, url,
       ood_last_cmt_rev, ood_last_cmt_date, ood_kind, ood_last_cmt_author,
       tree_conflict, file_external, pristine_text_status,
       pristine_prop_status fields.

       $wcent->deleted()
           Deleted, but parent rev lags behind.

       $wcent->absent()
           Absent -- we know an entry of this name exists, but that's all
           (usually this happens because of authz restrictions)

       $wcent->incomplete()
           For THIS_DIR entry, implies whole entries file is incomplete.

       $wcent->copyfrom_url()
           Copyfrom location.

           this external item.

       $ext->url()
           Where to check out from. This is possibly a relative external URL,
           as allowed in externals definitions, but without the peg revision.

       $ext->revision()
           What revision to check out, a svn_opt_revision_t object.  The only
