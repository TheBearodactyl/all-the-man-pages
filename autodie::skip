autodie::skip(3perl)                                                                 Perl Programmers Reference Guide                                                                 autodie::skip(3perl)

NAME
       autodie::skip - Skip a package when throwing autodie exceptions

SYNPOSIS
           use parent qw(autodie::skip);

DESCRIPTION
       This dummy class exists to signal that the class inheriting it should be skipped when reporting exceptions from autodie.  This is useful for utility classes like Path::Tiny that wish to report
       the location of where they were called on failure.

       If your class has a better way of doing roles, then you should not load this class and instead simply say that your class DOES "autodie::skip" instead.
