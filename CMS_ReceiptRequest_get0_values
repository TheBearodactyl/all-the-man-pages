NAME
       CMS_ReceiptRequest_create0_ex, CMS_ReceiptRequest_create0, CMS_add1_ReceiptRequest, CMS_get1_ReceiptRequest, CMS_ReceiptRequest_get0_values - CMS signed receipt request functions

SYNOPSIS
        #include <openssl/cms.h>

        CMS_ReceiptRequest *CMS_ReceiptRequest_create0_ex(
            unsigned char *id, int idlen, int allorfirst,
            STACK_OF(GENERAL_NAMES) *receiptList, STACK_OF(GENERAL_NAMES) *receiptsTo,
            OSSL_LIB_CTX *libctx);
        CMS_ReceiptRequest *CMS_ReceiptRequest_create0(
            unsigned char *id, int idlen, int allorfirst,
            STACK_OF(GENERAL_NAMES) *receiptList, STACK_OF(GENERAL_NAMES) *receiptsTo);
        int CMS_add1_ReceiptRequest(CMS_SignerInfo *si, CMS_ReceiptRequest *rr);
        int CMS_get1_ReceiptRequest(CMS_SignerInfo *si, CMS_ReceiptRequest **prr);
        void CMS_ReceiptRequest_get0_values(CMS_ReceiptRequest *rr, ASN1_STRING **pcid,
                                            int *pallorfirst,
                                            STACK_OF(GENERAL_NAMES) **plist,
                                            STACK_OF(GENERAL_NAMES) **prto);

DESCRIPTION
       CMS_ReceiptRequest_create0_ex() creates a signed receipt request structure. The signedContentIdentifier field is set using id and idlen, or it is set to 32 bytes of pseudo random data if id is
       NULL.  If receiptList is NULL the allOrFirstTier option in receiptsFrom is used and set to the value of the allorfirst parameter. If receiptList is not NULL the receiptList option in receiptsFrom
       is used. The receiptsTo parameter specifies the receiptsTo field value. The library context libctx is used to find the public random generator.

       CMS_ReceiptRequest_create0() is similar to CMS_ReceiptRequest_create0_ex() but uses default values of NULL for the library context libctx.

       The CMS_add1_ReceiptRequest() function adds a signed receipt request rr to SignerInfo structure si.

       int CMS_get1_ReceiptRequest() looks for a signed receipt request in si, if any is found it is decoded and written to prr.

       CMS_ReceiptRequest_get0_values() retrieves the values of a receipt request.  The signedContentIdentifier is copied to pcid. If the allOrFirstTier option of receiptsFrom is used its value is
       copied to pallorfirst otherwise the receiptList field is copied to plist. The receiptsTo parameter is copied to prto.

NOTES
       For more details of the meaning of the fields see RFC2634.

       The contents of a signed receipt should only be considered meaningful if the corresponding CMS_ContentInfo structure can be successfully verified using CMS_verify().

RETURN VALUES
       CMS_ReceiptRequest_create0_ex() and CMS_ReceiptRequest_create0() return a signed receipt request structure or NULL if an error occurred.

       CMS_add1_ReceiptRequest() returns 1 for success or 0 if an error occurred.

       CMS_get1_ReceiptRequest() returns 1 is a signed receipt request is found and decoded. It returns 0 if a signed receipt request is not present and -1 if it is present but malformed.
