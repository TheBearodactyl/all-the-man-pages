SSL_SESSION_GET0_HOSTNAME(3ssl)     OpenSSL    SSL_SESSION_GET0_HOSTNAME(3ssl)

NAME
       SSL_SESSION_get0_hostname, SSL_SESSION_set1_hostname,
       SSL_SESSION_get0_alpn_selected, SSL_SESSION_set1_alpn_selected - get
       and set SNI and ALPN data associated with a session

SYNOPSIS
        #include <openssl/ssl.h>

        const char *SSL_SESSION_get0_hostname(const SSL_SESSION *s);
        int SSL_SESSION_set1_hostname(SSL_SESSION *s, const char *hostname);

        void SSL_SESSION_get0_alpn_selected(const SSL_SESSION *s,
                                            const unsigned char **alpn,
                                            size_t *len);
        int SSL_SESSION_set1_alpn_selected(SSL_SESSION *s, const unsigned char *alpn,
                                           size_t len);

DESCRIPTION
       SSL_SESSION_get0_hostname() retrieves the SNI value that was sent by
       the client when the session was created if it was accepted by the
       server and TLSv1.2 or below was negotiated. Otherwise NULL is returned.
       Note that in TLSv1.3 the SNI hostname is negotiated with each handshake
       including resumption handshakes and is therefore never associated with
       the session.

       The value returned is a pointer to memory maintained within s and
       should not be free'd.

       SSL_SESSION_set1_hostname() sets the SNI value for the hostname to a
       copy of the string provided in hostname.

       SSL_SESSION_get0_alpn_selected() retrieves the selected ALPN protocol
       for this session and its associated length in bytes. The returned value
       of *alpn is a pointer to memory maintained within s and should not be
       free'd.

       SSL_SESSION_set1_alpn_selected() sets the ALPN protocol for this
       session to the value in alpn which should be of length len bytes. A
       copy of the input value is made, and the caller retains ownership of
       the memory pointed to by alpn.

RETURN VALUES
       SSL_SESSION_get0_hostname() returns either a string or NULL based on if
       there is the SNI value sent by client.

       SSL_SESSION_set1_hostname() returns 1 on success or 0 on error.

       SSL_SESSION_set1_alpn_selected() returns 1 on success or 0 on error.

HISTORY
       The SSL_SESSION_set1_hostname(), SSL_SESSION_get0_alpn_selected() and
       SSL_SESSION_set1_alpn_selected() functions were added in OpenSSL 1.1.1.
