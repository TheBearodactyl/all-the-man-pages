NAME
       CURLOPT_RESUME_FROM_LARGE - offset to resume transfer from

SYNOPSIS
       #include <curl/curl.h>

       CURLcode curl_easy_setopt(CURL *handle, CURLOPT_RESUME_FROM_LARGE,
                                 curl_off_t from);

DESCRIPTION
       Pass a curl_off_t as parameter. It contains the offset in number of bytes that you want the transfer to start from. Set this option to 0 to make the transfer start from the beginning (effectively
       disabling resume). For FTP, set this option to -1 to make the transfer start from the end of the target file (useful to continue an interrupted upload).

       When doing uploads with FTP, the resume position is where in the local/source file libcurl should try to resume the upload from and it will then append the source file to the remote target file.

DEFAULT
       0, not used

PROTOCOLS
       HTTP, FTP, SFTP, FILE

EXAMPLE
       CURL *curl = curl_easy_init();
       if(curl) {
         curl_off_t resume_position = GET_IT_SOMEHOW;
         curl_off_t file_size = GET_IT_SOMEHOW_AS_WELL;

         curl_easy_setopt(curl, CURLOPT_URL, "ftp://example.com");

         /* resuming upload at this position, possibly beyond 2GB */
         curl_easy_setopt(curl, CURLOPT_RESUME_FROM_LARGE, resume_position);

         /* ask for upload */
         curl_easy_setopt(curl, CURLOPT_UPLOAD, 1L);

         /* set total data amount to expect */
         curl_easy_setopt(curl, CURLOPT_INFILESIZE_LARGE, file_size);

         /* Perform the request */
         curl_easy_perform(curl);
       }

AVAILABILITY
       Added in 7.11.0

RETURN VALUE
       Returns CURLE_OK if the option is supported, and CURLE_UNKNOWN_OPTION if not.
