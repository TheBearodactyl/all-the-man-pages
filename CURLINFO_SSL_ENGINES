NAME
       CURLINFO_SSL_ENGINES - get an slist of OpenSSL crypto-engines

SYNOPSIS
       #include <curl/curl.h>

       CURLcode curl_easy_getinfo(CURL *handle, CURLINFO_SSL_ENGINES,
                                  struct curl_slist **engine_list);

DESCRIPTION
       Pass  the  address of a 'struct curl_slist *' to receive a linked-list of OpenSSL crypto-engines supported. Note that engines are normally implemented in separate dynamic libraries. Hence not all
       the returned engines may be available at runtime. NOTE: you must call curl_slist_free_all(3) on the list pointer once you are done with it, as libcurl will not free the data for you.

PROTOCOLS
       All TLS based ones.

EXAMPLE
       CURL *curl = curl_easy_init();
       if(curl) {
         CURLcode res;
         struct curl_slist *engines;
         res = curl_easy_getinfo(curl, CURLINFO_SSL_ENGINES, &engines);
         if((res == CURLE_OK) && engines) {
           /* we have a list, free it when done using it */
           curl_slist_free_all(engines);
         }

         curl_easy_cleanup(curl);
       }

AVAILABILITY
       Added in 7.12.3. Available in OpenSSL builds with "engine" support.

RETURN VALUE
       Returns CURLE_OK if the option is supported, and CURLE_UNKNOWN_OPTION if not.
