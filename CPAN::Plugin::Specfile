NAME
       CPAN::Plugin::Specfile - Proof of concept implementation of a trivial CPAN::Plugin

SYNOPSIS
         # once in the cpan shell
         o conf plugin_list push CPAN::Plugin::Specfile

         # make permanent
         o conf commit

         # any time in the cpan shell to write a spec file
         test Acme::Meta

         # disable
         # if it is the last in plugin_list:
         o conf plugin_list pop
         # otherwise, determine the index to splice:
         o conf plugin_list
         # and then use splice, e.g. to splice position 3:
         o conf plugin_list splice 3 1

DESCRIPTION
       Implemented as a post-test hook, this plugin writes a specfile after every successful test run. The content is also written to the terminal.

       As a side effect, the timestamps of the written specfiles reflect the linear order of all dependencies.

       WARNING: This code is just a small demo how to use the plugin system of the CPAN shell, not a full fledged spec file writer. Do not expect new features in this plugin.

   OPTIONS
       The target directory to store the spec files in can be set using "dir" as in

         o conf plugin_list push CPAN::Plugin::Specfile=dir,/tmp/specfiles-000042

       The default directory for this is the "plugins/CPAN::Plugin::Specfile" directory in the cpan_home directory.
