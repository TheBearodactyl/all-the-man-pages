NAME
       XkbGetKeyboard -   Retrieves one or more components of a keyboard device description

SYNOPSIS
       XkbDescPtr XkbGetKeyboard (Display *display, unsigned int which, unsigned int device_spec);

ARGUMENTS
       display
              connection to the X server

       device_spec
              device ID, or XkbUseCoreKbd

       bits_to_change
              determines events to be selected / deselected

       values_for_bits
              1=>select, 0->deselect; for events in bits_to_change

DESCRIPTION
       XkbGetKeyboard allocates and returns a pointer to a keyboard description. It queries the server for those components specified in the which parameter for device device_spec and copies the results
       to the XkbDescRec it allocated. The remaining fields in the keyboard description are set to NULL. The valid masks for which are those listed in Table 1.

       XkbGetKeyboard is used to read the current description for one or more components of a keyboard device. It calls XkbGetKeyboardByName(3) as follows:

       XkbGetKeyboardByName(dpy, device_spec, NULL, which, which, False).

       If successful, XkbGetKeyboard returns a pointer to a newly allocated XkbDescRec structure, which is described in XkbGetKeyboardByName(3), and which should be freed  with  XkbFreeKeyboard(3).   If
       XkbGetKeyboard does not succeed, it returns NULL.

DIAGNOSTICS
       BadAlloc       Unable to allocate storage
