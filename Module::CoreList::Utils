NAME
       Module::CoreList::Utils - what utilities shipped with versions of perl

SYNOPSIS
        use Module::CoreList::Utils;

        print $Module::CoreList::Utils::utilities{5.009003}{ptar}; # prints 1

        print Module::CoreList::Utils->first_release('corelist');
        # prints 5.008009

        print Module::CoreList::Utils->first_release_by_date('corelist');
        # prints 5.009002

DESCRIPTION
       Module::CoreList::Utils provides information on which core and dual-life utilities shipped with each version of perl.

       It provides a number of mechanisms for querying this information.

       There is a functional programming API available for programmers to query information.

       Programmers may also query the contained hash structure to find relevant information.

FUNCTIONS API
       These are the functions that are available, they may either be called as functions or class methods:

         Module::CoreList::Utils::first_release('corelist'); # as a function

         Module::CoreList::Utils->first_release('corelist'); # class method

       "utilities"
           Requires a perl version as an argument, returns a list of utilities that shipped with that version of perl, or undef/empty list if that perl doesn't exist.

       "first_release( UTILITY )"
           Requires a UTILITY name as an argument, returns the perl version when that utility first appeared in core as ordered by perl version number or undef ( in scalar context ) or an empty list (
           in list context ) if that utility is not in core.

       "first_release_by_date( UTILITY )"
           Requires a UTILITY name as an argument, returns the perl version when that utility first appeared in core as ordered by release date or undef ( in scalar context ) or an empty list ( in list
           context ) if that utility is not in core.

       "removed_from( UTILITY )"
           Takes a UTILITY name as an argument, returns the first perl version where that utility was removed from core. Returns undef if the given utility was never in core or remains in core.

       "removed_from_by_date( UTILITY )"
           Takes a UTILITY name as an argument, returns the first perl version by release date where that utility was removed from core. Returns undef if the given utility was never in core or remains
           in core.

DATA STRUCTURES
       These are the hash data structures that are available:

       %Module::CoreList::Utils::utilities
           A hash of hashes that is keyed on perl version as indicated in $].  The second level hash is utility / defined pairs.
