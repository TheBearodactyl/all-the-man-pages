SD_BUS_SET_SENDER(3)           sd_bus_set_sender          SD_BUS_SET_SENDER(3)

NAME
       sd_bus_set_sender, sd_bus_get_sender - Configure default sender for
       outgoing messages

SYNOPSIS
       #include <systemd/sd-bus.h>

       int sd_bus_set_sender(sd_bus *bus, const char* name);

       int sd_bus_get_sender(sd_bus *bus, const char** name);

DESCRIPTION
       sd_bus_set_sender() configures the default sender service name to use
       for outgoing messages. The service name specified in the name parameter
       is set on all outgoing messages that are sent on the connection and
       have no sender set yet, for example through
       sd_bus_message_set_sender(3). Note that this function is only supported
       on direct connections, i.e. not on connections to a bus broker as the
       broker will fill in the sender service name automatically anyway. By
       default no sender name is configured, and hence messages are sent
       without sender field set. If the name parameter is specified as NULL
       the default sender service name is cleared, returning to the default
       state if a default sender service name was set before. If passed as
       non-NULL the specified name must be a valid unique or well-known
       service name.

       sd_bus_get_sender() may be used to query the current default service
       name for outgoing messages.

RETURN VALUE
       On success, these functions return 0 or a positive integer. On failure,
       they return a negative errno-style error code.

   Errors
       Returned errors may indicate the following problems:

       -ECHILD
           The bus connection has been created in a different process.

       -EPERM
           The specified bus connection object is a not a direct but a
           brokered connection.

NOTES
       These APIs are implemented as a shared library, which can be compiled
       and linked to with the libsystemd pkg-config(1) file.
