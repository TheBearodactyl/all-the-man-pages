NAME
       CURLOPT_TCP_KEEPIDLE - TCP keep-alive idle time wait

SYNOPSIS

         /* enable TCP keep-alive for this transfer */
         curl_easy_setopt(curl, CURLOPT_TCP_KEEPALIVE, 1L);

         /* set keep-alive idle time to 120 seconds */
         curl_easy_setopt(curl, CURLOPT_TCP_KEEPIDLE, 120L);

         /* interval time between keep-alive probes: 60 seconds */
         curl_easy_setopt(curl, CURLOPT_TCP_KEEPINTVL, 60L);

         curl_easy_perform(curl);
       }
