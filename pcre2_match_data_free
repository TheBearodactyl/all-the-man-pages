PCRE2_MATCH_DATA_FREE(3)   Library Functions Manual   PCRE2_MATCH_DATA_FREE(3)

NAME
       PCRE2 - Perl-compatible regular expressions (revised API)

SYNOPSIS

       #include <pcre2.h>

       void pcre2_match_data_free(pcre2_match_data *match_data);

DESCRIPTION

       If   match_data   is  NULL,  this  function  does  nothing.  Otherwise,
       match_data must point to a match data block, which this function frees,
       using  the memory freeing function from the general context or compiled
       pattern with which it was created, or free() if that was not set.

       If the PCRE2_COPY_MATCHED_SUBJECT was used for a successful match using
       this match data block, the copy of the subject that was remembered with
       the block is also freed.

       There is a complete description of the PCRE2 native API in the pcre2api
       page and a description of the POSIX API in the pcre2posix page.
