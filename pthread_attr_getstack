NAME
       pthread_attr_setstack, pthread_attr_getstack - set/get stack attributes
       in thread attributes object

LIBRARY
       POSIX threads library (libpthread, -lpthread)

SYNOPSIS
       #include <pthread.h>

       int pthread_attr_setstack(pthread_attr_t *attr,
                                 void stackaddr[.stacksize],
                                 size_t stacksize);
       int pthread_attr_getstack(const pthread_attr_t *restrict attr,
                                 void **restrict stackaddr,
                                 size_t *restrict stacksize);

DESCRIPTION
       The pthread_attr_setstack() function sets the stack address  and  stack
       size  attributes of the thread attributes object referred to by attr to
       the values specified in stackaddr and stacksize,  respectively.   These
       attributes  specify  the  location and size of the stack that should be
       used by a thread that is created using  the  thread  attributes  object
       attr.

       stackaddr  should  point  to the lowest addressable byte of a buffer of
       stacksize bytes that was allocated by the caller.  The pages of the al‐
       located buffer should be both readable and writable.

       The  pthread_attr_getstack()  function  returns  the  stack address and
       stack size attributes of the thread attributes object  referred  to  by
       attr  in  the  buffers  pointed  to by stackaddr and stacksize, respec‐
       tively.

RETURN VALUE
       On success, these functions return 0; on error, they return  a  nonzero
       error number.

ERRORS
       pthread_attr_setstack() can fail with the following error:

       EINVAL stacksize is less than PTHREAD_STACK_MIN (16384) bytes.  On some
              systems, this error  may  also  occur  if  stackaddr  or  stack‐
              addr + stacksize is not suitably aligned.

       POSIX.1  also  documents an EACCES error if the stack area described by
       stackaddr and stacksize is  not  both  readable  and  writable  by  the
       caller.

HISTORY

NOTES
       These  functions  are provided for applications that must ensure that a
       thread's stack is placed in a particular location.  For  most  applica‐
       tions,  this is not necessary, and the use of these functions should be
       avoided.  (Use pthread_attr_setstacksize(3) if  an  application  simply
       requires a stack size other than the default.)

       When  an application employs pthread_attr_setstack(), it takes over the
       responsibility of allocating the stack.  Any guard size value that  was
       set  using  pthread_attr_setguardsize(3)  is ignored.  If deemed neces‐
       sary, it is the application's responsibility to allocate a  guard  area
       (one or more pages protected against reading and writing) to handle the
       possibility of stack overflow.

       The address specified in stackaddr should be suitably aligned: for full
       portability,  align  it  on  a  page  boundary (sysconf(_SC_PAGESIZE)).
       posix_memalign(3) may be useful for  allocation.   Probably,  stacksize
       should also be a multiple of the system page size.

       If attr is used to create multiple threads, then the caller must change
       the stack address attribute between calls to pthread_create(3);  other‐
       wise,  the  threads  will attempt to use the same memory area for their
       stacks, and chaos will ensue.

NAME
       pthread_attr_getstack, pthread_attr_setstack — get and  set  stack  at‐
       tributes

SYNOPSIS
       #include <pthread.h>

       int pthread_attr_getstack(const pthread_attr_t *restrict attr,
           void **restrict stackaddr, size_t *restrict stacksize);
       int pthread_attr_setstack(pthread_attr_t *attr, void *stackaddr,
           size_t stacksize);

DESCRIPTION
       The  pthread_attr_getstack() and pthread_attr_setstack() functions, re‐
       spectively, shall get and set  the  thread  creation  stack  attributes
       stackaddr and stacksize in the attr object.

       The  stack  attributes  specify  the area of storage to be used for the
       created thread's stack. The base (lowest addressable byte) of the stor‐
       age  shall be stackaddr, and the size of the storage shall be stacksize
       bytes. The  stacksize  shall  be  at  least  {PTHREAD_STACK_MIN}.   The
       pthread_attr_setstack()  function  may  fail with [EINVAL] if stackaddr
       does not meet implementation-defined alignment requirements.  All pages
       within  the  stack  described  by stackaddr and stacksize shall be both
       readable and writable by the thread.

       If the pthread_attr_getstack() function is called before the  stackaddr
       attribute has been set, the behavior is unspecified.

       The  behavior  is undefined if the value specified by the attr argument
       to pthread_attr_getstack() or pthread_attr_setstack() does not refer to
       an initialized thread attributes object.

RETURN VALUE
       Upon  successful completion, these functions shall return a value of 0;
       otherwise, an error number shall be returned to indicate the error.

       The pthread_attr_getstack() function shall store  the  stack  attribute
       values in stackaddr and stacksize if successful.

ERRORS
       The pthread_attr_setstack() function shall fail if:

       EINVAL The  value  of stacksize is less than {PTHREAD_STACK_MIN} or ex‐
              ceeds an implementation-defined limit.

       The pthread_attr_setstack() function may fail if:

       EINVAL The value of stackaddr does not have proper alignment to be used
              as  a  stack,  or  ((char  *)stackaddr + stacksize) lacks proper
              alignment.

       EACCES The stack page(s) described by stackaddr and stacksize  are  not
              both readable and writable by the thread.

       These functions shall not return an error code of [EINTR].

       The following sections are informative.

EXAMPLES
       None.

APPLICATION USAGE
       These  functions are appropriate for use by applications in an environ‐
       ment where the stack for a thread must be placed in some particular re‐
       gion of memory.

       While  it might seem that an application could detect stack overflow by
       providing a protected page outside the  specified  stack  region,  this
       cannot be done portably. Implementations are free to place the thread's
       initial stack pointer anywhere within the specified region to  accommo‐
       date  the machine's stack pointer behavior and allocation requirements.
       Furthermore, on some architectures, such  as  the  IA‐64,  ``overflow''
       might mean that two separate stack pointers allocated within the region
       will overlap somewhere in the middle of the region.

       After a successful call to pthread_attr_setstack(),  the  storage  area
       specified by the stackaddr parameter is under the control of the imple‐
       mentation, as described in Section 2.9.8,  Use  of  Application-Managed
       Thread Stacks.

       The  specification of the stackaddr attribute presents several ambigui‐
       ties that make portable use of these functions impossible. For example,
       the  standard  allows implementations to impose arbitrary alignment re‐
       quirements on stackaddr.  Applications cannot assume that a buffer  ob‐
       tained from malloc() is suitably aligned. Note that although the stack‐
       size value passed to pthread_attr_setstack() must satisfy alignment re‐
       quirements,  the same is not true for pthread_attr_setstacksize() where
       the implementation must increase the specified  size  if  necessary  to
       achieve the proper alignment.

RATIONALE
       If an implementation detects that the value specified by the attr argu‐
       ment to pthread_attr_getstack() or pthread_attr_setstack() does not re‐
       fer  to an initialized thread attributes object, it is recommended that
       the function should fail and report an [EINVAL] error.

FUTURE DIRECTIONS
       None.
