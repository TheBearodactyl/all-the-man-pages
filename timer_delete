PROLOG
       This  manual  page is part of the POSIX Programmer's Manual.  The Linux implementation of this interface may differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for details of Linux behavior), or
       the interface may not be implemented on Linux.

NAME
       timer_delete — delete a per-process timer

SYNOPSIS
       #include <time.h>

       int timer_delete(timer_t timerid);

DESCRIPTION
       The timer_delete() function deletes the specified timer, timerid, previously created by the timer_create() function. If the timer is armed when timer_delete() is called, the behavior shall be  as
       if the timer is automatically disarmed before removal. The disposition of pending signals for the deleted timer is unspecified.

       The behavior is undefined if the value specified by the timerid argument to timer_delete() does not correspond to a timer ID returned by timer_create() but not yet deleted by timer_delete().

RETURN VALUE
       If successful, the timer_delete() function shall return a value of zero. Otherwise, the function shall return a value of -1 and set errno to indicate the error.

ERRORS
       No errors are defined.

       The following sections are informative.

EXAMPLES
       None.

APPLICATION USAGE
       None.

RATIONALE
       If an implementation detects that the value specified by the timerid argument to timer_delete() does not correspond to a timer ID returned by timer_create() but not yet deleted by timer_delete(),
       it is recommended that the function should fail and report an [EINVAL] error.

FUTURE DIRECTIONS
       None.

NAME
       timer_delete - delete a POSIX per-process timer

LIBRARY
       Real-time library (librt, -lrt)

SYNOPSIS
       #include <time.h>

       int timer_delete(timer_t timerid);

   Feature Test Macro Requirements for glibc (see feature_test_macros(7)):

       timer_delete():
           _POSIX_C_SOURCE >= 199309L

DESCRIPTION
       timer_delete()  deletes  the timer whose ID is given in timerid.  If the timer was armed at the time of this call, it is disarmed before being deleted.  The treatment of any pending signal gener‐
       ated by the deleted timer is unspecified.

RETURN VALUE
       On success, timer_delete() returns 0.  On failure, -1 is returned, and errno is set to indicate the error.

ERRORS
       EINVAL timerid is not a valid timer ID.

STANDARDS
       POSIX.1-2008.

HISTORY
       Linux 2.6.  POSIX.1-2001.
