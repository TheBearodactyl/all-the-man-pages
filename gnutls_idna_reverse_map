       gnutls_idna_reverse_map - API function

SYNOPSIS
       #include <gnutls/gnutls.h>

       int gnutls_idna_reverse_map(const char * input, unsigned ilen, gnutls_datum_t * out, unsigned flags);

ARGUMENTS
       const char * input
                   contain the ACE (IDNA) formatted domain name

       unsigned ilen
                   the length of the provided string

       gnutls_datum_t * out
                   the result in an null-terminated allocated UTF-8 string
