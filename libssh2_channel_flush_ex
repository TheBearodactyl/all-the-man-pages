NAME
       libssh2_channel_flush_ex - flush a channel

SYNOPSIS
       #include <libssh2.h>

       int libssh2_channel_flush_ex(LIBSSH2_CHANNEL *channel, int streamid);

       int libssh2_channel_flush(LIBSSH2_CHANNEL *channel);

       int libssh2_channel_flush_stderr(LIBSSH2_CHANNEL *channel);

DESCRIPTION
       channel - Active channel stream to flush.

       streamid - Specific substream number to flush. Groups of substreams may be flushed by passing on of the following Constants.
       LIBSSH2_CHANNEL_FLUSH_EXTENDED_DATA: Flush all extended data substreams
       LIBSSH2_CHANNEL_FLUSH_ALL: Flush all substreams

       Flush the read buffer for a given channel instance. Individual substreams may be flushed by number or using one of the provided macros.

RETURN VALUE
       Return 0 on success or negative on failure.  It returns LIBSSH2_ERROR_EAGAIN when it would otherwise block. While LIBSSH2_ERROR_EAGAIN is a negative number, it isn't really a failure per se.
