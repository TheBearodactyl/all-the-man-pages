NAME
       fincore - count pages of file contents in core

SYNOPSIS
       fincore [options] file...

DESCRIPTION
       fincore counts pages of file contents being resident in memory (in core), and reports the numbers. If an error occurs during counting, then an error message is printed to the stderr and fincore
       continues processing the rest of files listed in a command line.

       The default output is subject to change. So whenever possible, you should avoid using default outputs in your scripts. Always explicitly define expected columns by using --output columns-list in
       environments where a stable output is required.

OPTIONS
       -n, --noheadings
           Do not print a header line in status output.

       -b, --bytes
           Print the sizes in bytes rather than in a human-readable format.

           By default, the unit, sizes are expressed in, is byte, and unit prefixes are in power of 2^10 (1024). Abbreviations of symbols are exhibited truncated in order to reach a better readability,
           by exhibiting alone the first letter of them; examples: "1 KiB" and "1 MiB" are respectively exhibited as "1 K" and "1 M", then omitting on purpose the mention "iB", which is part of these
           abbreviations.

       -o, --output list
           Define output columns. See the --help output to get a list of the currently supported columns. The default list of columns may be extended if list is specified in the format +list.

       -r, --raw
           Produce output in raw format. All potentially unsafe characters are hex-escaped (\x<code>).

       -J, --json
           Use JSON output format.

       -h, --help
           Display help text and exit.

       -V, --version
           Print version and exit.
