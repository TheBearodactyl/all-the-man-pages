NAME
       gnutls_x509_crt_get_signature_algorithm - API function

SYNOPSIS
       #include <gnutls/x509.h>

       int gnutls_x509_crt_get_signature_algorithm(gnutls_x509_crt_t cert);

ARGUMENTS
       gnutls_x509_crt_t cert
                   should contain a gnutls_x509_crt_t type

DESCRIPTION
       This function will return a value of the gnutls_sign_algorithm_t enumeration that is the signature algorithm that has been used to sign this certificate.

       Since 3.6.0 this function never returns a negative error code.  Error cases and unknown/unsupported signature algorithms are mapped to GNUTLS_SIGN_UNKNOWN.

RETURNS
       a gnutls_sign_algorithm_t value
