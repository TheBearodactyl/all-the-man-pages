NAME
       File::Spec::Cygwin - methods for Cygwin file specs

SYNOPSIS
        require File::Spec::Cygwin; # Done internally by File::Spec if needed

DESCRIPTION
       See File::Spec and File::Spec::Unix.  This package overrides the implementation of these methods, not the semantics.

       This module is still in beta.  Cygwin-knowledgeable folks are invited to offer patches and suggestions.

       canonpath
           Any "\" (backslashes) are converted to "/" (forward slashes), and then File::Spec::Unix canonpath() is called on the result.

       file_name_is_absolute
           True is returned if the file name begins with "drive_letter:", and if not, File::Spec::Unix file_name_is_absolute() is called.

       tmpdir (override)
           Returns a string representation of the first existing directory from the following list:

               $ENV{TMPDIR}
               /tmp
               $ENV{'TMP'}
               $ENV{'TEMP'}
               C:/temp

           If running under taint mode, and if the environment variables are tainted, they are not used.

       case_tolerant
           Override Unix. Cygwin case-tolerance depends on managed mount settings and as with MsWin32 on GetVolumeInformation() $ouFsFlags == FS_CASE_SENSITIVE, indicating the case significance when
           comparing file specifications.  Default: 1
