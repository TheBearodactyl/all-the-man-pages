NAME
       gnutls_pcert_import_x509_list - API function

SYNOPSIS
       #include <gnutls/abstract.h>

       int gnutls_pcert_import_x509_list(gnutls_pcert_st * pcert_list, gnutls_x509_crt_t * crt, unsigned * ncrt, unsigned int flags);

ARGUMENTS
       gnutls_pcert_st * pcert_list
                   The structures to store the certificates; must not contain initialized gnutls_pcert_st structures.

       gnutls_x509_crt_t * crt
                   The certificates to be imported

       unsigned * ncrt
                   The number of certificates in  crt ; will be updated if necessary

       unsigned int flags
                   zero or GNUTLS_X509_CRT_LIST_SORT

DESCRIPTION
       This  convenience  function  will  import  the  given  certificates  to  an  already  allocated  set  of  gnutls_pcert_st  structures.  The  structures  must  be  deinitialized  afterwards  using
       gnutls_pcert_deinit().  pcert_list should contain space for at least  ncrt elements.

       In the case GNUTLS_X509_CRT_LIST_SORT is specified and that function cannot sort the list, GNUTLS_E_CERTIFICATE_LIST_UNSORTED will be returned. Currently sorting can fail if the list size exceeds
       an internal constraint (16).

RETURNS
       On success, GNUTLS_E_SUCCESS (0) is returned, otherwise a negative error value.

SINCE
       3.4.0
