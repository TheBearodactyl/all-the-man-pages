NAME
       Test2::Event::Skip - Skip event type

DESCRIPTION
       Skip events bump test counts just like Test2::Event::Ok events, but they can never fail.

SYNOPSIS
           use Test2::API qw/context/;
           use Test2::Event::Skip;

           my $ctx = context();
           my $event = $ctx->skip($name, $reason);

       or:

           my $ctx   = context();
           my $event = $ctx->send_event(
               'Skip',
               name   => $name,
               reason => $reason,
           );

ACCESSORS
       $reason = $e->reason
           The original true/false value of whatever was passed into the event (but reduced down to 1 or 0).
