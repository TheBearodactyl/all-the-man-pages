NAME
       gnutls_ocsp_resp_get_responder2 - API function

SYNOPSIS
       #include <gnutls/ocsp.h>

       int gnutls_ocsp_resp_get_responder2(gnutls_ocsp_resp_const_t resp, gnutls_datum_t * dn, unsigned flags);

ARGUMENTS
       gnutls_ocsp_resp_const_t resp
                   should contain a gnutls_ocsp_resp_t type

       gnutls_datum_t * dn
                   newly allocated buffer with name

       unsigned flags
                   zero or GNUTLS_X509_DN_FLAG_COMPAT

DESCRIPTION
       This  function  will  extract  the  name of the Basic OCSP Response in the provided buffer. The name will be in the form "C=xxxx,O=yyyy,CN=zzzz" as described in RFC2253. The output string will be
       ASCII or UTF-8 encoded, depending on the certificate data.

       If the responder ID is not a name but a hash, this function will return zero and the  dn elements will be set to NULL.

       The caller needs to deallocate memory by calling gnutls_free() on
        dn ->data.

       When the flag GNUTLS_X509_DN_FLAG_COMPAT is specified, the output format will match the format output by previous to 3.5.6 versions of GnuTLS which was not not fully RFC4514-compliant.

RETURNS
       On success, GNUTLS_E_SUCCESS (0) is returned, otherwise a negative error code is returned. When no data exist it will return GNUTLS_E_REQUESTED_DATA_NOT_AVAILABLE.
