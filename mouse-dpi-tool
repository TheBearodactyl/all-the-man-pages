NAME
       mouse-dpi-tool - mouse resolution estimation tool

SYNOPSIS
       mouse-dpi-tool <evdev device>

DESCRIPTION
       mouse-dpi-tool  reads relative events (mouse movement events) and calculates the distance covered and maximum frequency of the incoming events.  Combined with a measurement of the actual distance
       physically covered, this allows the mouse's resolution to be estimated.

       Some mouse devices provide dynamic frequencies, it is recommended to measure multiple times to obtain the highest value.

OPTIONS
       mouse-dpi-tool accepts no options.

                                                                                                                                                                                         MOUSE-DPI-TOOL(1)
