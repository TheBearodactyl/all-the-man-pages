NAME
       sd_bus_get_n_queued_read, sd_bus_get_n_queued_write - Get the number of
       pending bus messages in the read and write queues of a bus connection
       object

SYNOPSIS
       #include <systemd/sd-bus.h>

       int sd_bus_get_n_queued_read(sd_bus *bus, uint64_t *ret);

       int sd_bus_get_n_queued_write(sd_bus *bus, uint64_t *ret);

DESCRIPTION
       sd_bus_get_n_queued_read() may be used to query the number of bus
       messages in the read queue of a bus connection object. The read queue
       contains all messages read from the transport medium (e.g. network
       socket) but not yet processed locally. The function expects two
       arguments: the bus object to query, and a pointer to a 64bit counter
       variable to write the current queue size to. Use sd_bus_process() in
       order to process queued messages, i.e. to reduce the size of the read
       queue (as well as, in fact, the write queue, see below).

       Similarly, sd_bus_get_n_queued_write() may be used to query the number
       of currently pending bus messages in the write queue of a bus
       connection object. The write queue contains all messages enqueued into
       the connection with a call such as sd_bus_send() but not yet written to
       the transport medium. The expected arguments are similar to
       sd_bus_get_n_queued_read(). Here too, use sd_bus_process() to reduce
       the size of the write queue. Alternatively, use sd_bus_flush() to
       synchronously write out any pending bus messages until the write queue
       is empty.

RETURN VALUE
       On success, these functions return 0 or a positive integer. On failure,
       they return a negative errno-style error code.

   Errors
       Returned errors may indicate the following problems:

       -ECHILD
           The bus connection was created in a different process.
