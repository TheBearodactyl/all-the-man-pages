NAME
     acl_from_text — create an ACL from text

LIBRARY
     Linux Access Control Lists library (libacl, -lacl).

SYNOPSIS
     #include <sys/types.h>
     #include <sys/acl.h>

     acl_t
     acl_from_text(const char *buf_p);

DESCRIPTION
     The acl_from_text() function converts the text form of the ACL referred to by buf_p into the internal form of an ACL and returns a pointer to the working storage that contains the ACL. The
     acl_from_text() function accepts as input the long text form and short text form of an ACL as described in acl(5).

     This function may cause memory to be allocated.  The caller should free any releasable memory, when the new ACL is no longer required, by calling acl_free(3) with the (void*)acl_t returned by
     acl_from_text() as an argument.

RETURN VALUE
     On success, this function returns a pointer to the working storage.  On error, a value of (acl_t)NULL is returned, and errno is set appropriately.

ERRORS
     If any of the following conditions occur, the acl_from_text() function returns a value of (acl_t)NULL and sets errno to the corresponding value:

     [EINVAL]           The argument buf_p cannot be translated into an ACL.

     [ENOMEM]           The acl_t to be returned requires more memory than is allowed by the hardware or system-imposed memory management constraints.

STANDARDS
     IEEE Std 1003.1e draft 17 (“POSIX.1e”, abandoned)
