NAME
       gnutls_session_set_data - API function

SYNOPSIS
       #include <gnutls/gnutls.h>

       int gnutls_session_set_data(gnutls_session_t session, const void * session_data, size_t session_data_size);

ARGUMENTS
       gnutls_session_t session
                   is a gnutls_session_t type.

       const void * session_data
                   is a pointer to space to hold the session.

       size_t session_data_size
                   is the session's size

DESCRIPTION
       Sets  all  session  parameters, in order to resume a previously established session.  The session data given must be the one returned by gnutls_session_get_data().  This function should be called
       before gnutls_handshake().

       Keep in mind that session resuming is advisory. The server may choose not to resume the session, thus a full handshake will be performed.

RETURNS
       On success, GNUTLS_E_SUCCESS (0) is returned, otherwise an error code is returned.
