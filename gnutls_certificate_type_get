NAME
       gnutls_certificate_type_get - API function

SYNOPSIS
       #include <gnutls/gnutls.h>

       gnutls_certificate_type_t gnutls_certificate_type_get(gnutls_session_t session);

ARGUMENTS
       gnutls_session_t session
                   is a gnutls_session_t type.

DESCRIPTION
       This function returns the type of the certificate that is negotiated for this side to send to the peer. The certificate type is by default X.509, unless an alternative certificate type is enabled
       by gnutls_init() and negotiated during the session.

       Resumed sessions will return the certificate type that was negotiated and used in the original session.

       As of version 3.6.4 it is recommended to use gnutls_certificate_type_get2() which is more fine-grained.

RETURNS
       the currently used gnutls_certificate_type_t certificate type as negotiated for 'our' side of the connection.
