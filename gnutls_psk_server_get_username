NAME
       gnutls_psk_server_get_username - API function

SYNOPSIS
       #include <gnutls/gnutls.h>

       const char * gnutls_psk_server_get_username(gnutls_session_t session);

ARGUMENTS
       gnutls_session_t session
                   is a gnutls session

DESCRIPTION
       This should only be called in case of PSK authentication and in case of a server.

       The returned pointer should be considered constant (do not free) and valid for the lifetime of the session.

       This function will return NULL if the username has embedded NULL bytes.  In that case, gnutls_psk_server_get_username2() should be used to retrieve the username.

RETURNS
       the username of the peer, or NULL in case of an error, or if the username has embedded NULLs.
