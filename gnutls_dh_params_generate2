NAME
       gnutls_dh_params_generate2 - API function

SYNOPSIS
       #include <gnutls/gnutls.h>

       int gnutls_dh_params_generate2(gnutls_dh_params_t dparams, unsigned int bits);

ARGUMENTS
       gnutls_dh_params_t dparams
                   The parameters

       unsigned int bits
                   is the prime's number of bits

DESCRIPTION
       This function will generate a new pair of prime and generator for use in the Diffie-Hellman key exchange. This may take long time.

       It  is  recommended not to set the number of bits directly, but use gnutls_sec_param_to_pk_bits() instead.  Also note that the DH parameters are only useful to servers.  Since clients use the pa‐
       rameters sent by the server, it's of no use to call this in client side.

       The parameters generated are of the DSA form. It also is possible to generate provable parameters (following the Shawe-Taylor algorithm), using gnutls_x509_privkey_generate2() with DSA option and
       the GNUTLS_PRIVKEY_FLAG_PROVABLE flag set. These can the be imported with gnutls_dh_params_import_dsa().

       It is no longer recommended for applications to generate parameters.  See the "Parameter generation" section in the manual.

RETURNS
       On success, GNUTLS_E_SUCCESS (0) is returned, otherwise a negative error code is returned.
