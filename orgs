NAME
       orgs - Working with Teams & Orgs

   Description
       There are three levels of org users:

       1. Super admin, controls billing & adding people to the org.

       2. Team admin, manages team membership & package access.

       3. Developer, works on packages they are given access to.

       The super admin is the only person who can add users to the org because
       it impacts the monthly bill. The super admin will use  the  website  to
       manage  membership.  Every org has a developers team that all users are
       automatically added to.

       The team admin is the person who manages team  creation,  team  member‐
       ship,  and  package access for teams. The team admin grants package ac‐
       cess to teams, not individuals.

       The developer will be able to access packages based on the  teams  they
       are on. Access is either read-write or read-only.

       There are two main commands:

       1. npm team see npm help team for more details

       2. npm access see npm help access for more details

   Team Admins create teams
       • Check who you’ve added to your org:

         npm team ls <org>:developers

       • Each org is automatically given a developers team, so you can see the
         whole list of team members in your org. This team automatically  gets
         read-write  access  to all packages, but you can change that with the
         access command.

       • Create a new team:

         npm team create <org:team>

       • Add members to that team:

         npm team add <org:team> <user>

   Publish a package and adjust package access
       • In package directory, run

         npm init --scope=<org>

       to scope it for your org & publish as usual

       • Grant access:

         npm access grant <read-only|read-write> <org:team> [<package>]

       • Revoke access:

         npm access revoke <org:team> [<package>]

   Monitor your package access
       • See what org packages a team member can access:

         npm access ls-packages <org> <user>

       • See packages available to a specific team:

         npm access ls-packages <org:team>

       • Check which teams are collaborating on a package:

         npm access ls-collaborators <pkg>
