NAME
       CURLOPT_FORBID_REUSE - make connection get closed at once after use

SYNOPSIS
       #include <curl/curl.h>

       CURLcode curl_easy_setopt(CURL *handle, CURLOPT_FORBID_REUSE, long close);

DESCRIPTION
       Pass  a  long. Set close to 1 to make libcurl explicitly close the connection when done with the transfer. Normally, libcurl keeps all connections alive when done with one transfer in case a suc‚Äê
       ceeding one follows that can re-use them.  This option should be used with caution and only if you understand what it does as it can seriously impact performance.

       Set to 0 to have libcurl keep the connection open for possible later re-use (default behavior).

DEFAULT
       0

PROTOCOLS
       Most

EXAMPLE

         curl_easy_setopt(curl, CURLOPT_FORBID_REUSE, 1L);
         curl_easy_perform(curl);

         /* this second transfer may not reuse the same connection */
         curl_easy_perform(curl);
       }
