NAME
       xcb_set_selection_owner - Sets the owner of a selection

SYNOPSIS
       #include <xcb/xproto.h>

   Request function
       xcb_void_cookie_t xcb_set_selection_owner(xcb_connection_t *conn, xcb_window_t owner, xcb_atom_t selection, xcb_timestamp_t time);

REQUEST ARGUMENTS
       conn      The XCB connection to X11.

       owner     The new owner of the selection.

                 The special value XCB_NONE means that the selection will have no owner.

       selection The selection.

       time      Timestamp to avoid race conditions when running X over the network.

                 The selection will not be changed if time is earlier than the current last-change time of the selection or is later than the current X server time.  Otherwise, the last-change time is
                 set to the specified time.

                 The special value XCB_CURRENT_TIME will be replaced with the current server time.

       Makes window the owner of the selection selection and updates the last-change time of the specified selection.

       TODO: briefly explain what a selection is.

RETURN VALUE
       Returns an xcb_void_cookie_t. Errors (if any) have to be handled in the event loop.

       If you want to handle errors directly with xcb_request_check instead, use xcb_set_selection_owner_checked. See xcb-requests(3) for details.

ERRORS
       xcb_atom_error_t
                 selection does not refer to a valid atom.
