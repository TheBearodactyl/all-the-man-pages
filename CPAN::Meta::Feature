NAME
       CPAN::Meta::Feature - an optional feature provided by a CPAN distribution

VERSION
       version 2.150010

DESCRIPTION
       A CPAN::Meta::Feature object describes an optional feature offered by a CPAN distribution and specified in the distribution's META.json (or META.yml) file.

       For the most part, this class will only be used when operating on the result of the "feature" or "features" methods on a CPAN::Meta object.

METHODS
   new
         my $feature = CPAN::Meta::Feature->new( $identifier => \%spec );

       This returns a new Feature object.  The %spec argument to the constructor should be the same as the value of the "optional_feature" entry in the distmeta.  It must contain entries for
       "description" and "prereqs".

   identifier
       This method returns the feature's identifier.

   description
       This method returns the feature's long description.

   prereqs
       This method returns the feature's prerequisites as a CPAN::Meta::Prereqs object.

BUGS
       Please report any bugs or feature using the CPAN Request Tracker.  Bugs can be submitted through the web interface at <http://rt.cpan.org/Dist/Display.html?Queue=CPAN-Meta>

       When submitting a bug or request, please include a test-file or a patch to an existing test-file that illustrates the bug or desired feature.
