NAME
       io_uring_prep_sendmsg - prepare a sendmsg request

SYNOPSIS
       #include <sys/types.h>
       #include <sys/socket.h>
       #include <liburing.h>

       void io_uring_prep_sendmsg(struct io_uring_sqe *sqe,
                                  int fd,
                                  const struct msghdr *msg,
                                  unsigned flags);

DESCRIPTION
       The  io_uring_prep_sendmsg(3)  function  prepares  a  sendmsg  request.  The  submission queue entry sqe is setup to use the file descriptor fd to start sending the data indicated by msg with the
       sendmsg(2) defined flags in the flags argument.

       This function prepares an async sendmsg(2) request. See that man page for details.

RETURN VALUE
       None

ERRORS
       The CQE res field will contain the result of the operation. See the related man page for details on possible values. Note that where synchronous system calls will return -1 on failure and set er‐
       rno to the actual error value, io_uring never uses errno.  Instead it returns the negated errno directly in the CQE res field.

NOTES
       As  with  any request that passes in data in a struct, that data must remain valid until the request has been successfully submitted. It need not remain valid until completion. Once a request has
       been submitted, the in-kernel state is stable. Very early kernels (5.4 and earlier) required state to be stable until the completion occurred. Applications can test for this behavior by  inspect‐
       ing the IORING_FEAT_SUBMIT_STABLE flag passed back from io_uring_queue_init_params(3).
