NAME
       XkbGetIndicatorChanges - Updates a local copy of the keyboard description with the actual values of one or more calls to XkbNoteIndicatorChanges

SYNOPSIS
       Status XkbGetIndicatorChanges (Display *dpy, XkbDescPtr xkb, XkbIndicatorChangesPtr changes, unsigned int state);

ARGUMENTS
       dpy    connection to the X server

       xkb    keyboard description to hold the new values

       changes
              indicator maps/state to be obtained from the server

       state  backfilled with the state of the indicators

DESCRIPTION
       Whenever an indicator changes state, the server sends XkbIndicatorStateNotify events to all interested clients. Similarly, whenever an indicator's map changes, the server sends XkbIndicatorMapNo‐
       tify events to all interested clients.

       To receive XkbIndicatorStateNotify events, use XkbSelectEvents with both the bits_to_change and values_for_bits parameters containing XkbIndicatorStateNotifyMask. To receive XkbIndicatorMapNotify
       events, use XkbSelectEvents with XkbIndicatorMapNotifyMask.

       To  receive  events for only specific indicators, use XkbSelectEventDetails.  Set the event_type parameter to XkbIndicatorStateNotify or XkbIndicatorMapNotify, and set both the bits_to_change and
       values_for_bits detail parameters to a mask where each bit specifies one indicator, turning on those bits that specify the indicators for which you want to receive events.

       Both types of indicator events use the same structure:

       typedef struct _XkbIndicatorNotify {
         int            type;       /* Xkb extension base event code */
         unsigned long  serial;     /* X server serial number for event */
         Bool           send_event; /* True => synthetically generated */
         Display *      display;    /* server connection where event generated */
         Time           time;       /* server time when event generated */
         int            xkb_type;   /* specifies state or map notify */
         int            device;     /* Xkb device ID, will not be XkbUseCoreKbd */
         unsigned int   changed;    /* mask of indicators with new state or map */
         unsigned int   state;      /* current state of all indicators */
       } XkbIndicatorNotifyEvent;

       xkb_type is either XkbIndicatorStateNotify or XkbIndicatorMapNotify, depending on whether the event is a kbIndicatorStateNotify event or kbIndicatorMapNotify event.

       The changed parameter is a mask that is the bitwise inclusive OR of the indicators that have changed. If the event is of type XkbIndicatorMapNotify, changed reports the maps that changed. If  the
       event is of type XkbIndicatorStateNotify, changed reports the indicators that have changed state.  state is a mask that specifies the current state of all indicators, whether they have changed or
       not, for both XkbIndicatorStateNotify and IndicatorMapNotify events.

       When your client application receives either a XkbIndicatorStateNotify event or XkbIndicatorMapNotify event, you can note the changes in a changes structure by calling XkbNoteIndicatorChanges.

       XkbGetIndicatorChanges examines the changes parameter, pulls over the necessary information from the server, and copies the results into the xkb keyboard description. If any bits are set  in  the
       state_changes  field  of changes, XkbGetIndicatorChanges also places the state of those indicators in state.  If the indicators field of xkb is NULL, XkbGetIndicatorChanges allocates and initial‐
       izes it. To free the indicators field, use XkbFreeIndicators.

DIAGNOSTICS
       BadAlloc       Unable to allocate storage

       BadImplementation
                      Invalid reply from server

       BadMatch       A compatible version of Xkb was not available in the server or an argument has correct type and range, but is otherwise invalid
