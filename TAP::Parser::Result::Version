       The first version of TAP to include an explicit version number is 13.

OVERRIDDEN METHODS
       Mainly listed here to shut up the pitiful screams of the pod coverage tests.  They keep me awake at night.

       •   "as_string"

       •   "raw"

   Instance Methods
       "version"

         if ( $result->is_version ) {
            print $result->version;
         }

       This is merely a synonym for "as_string".
