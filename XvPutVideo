NAME
       XvPutVideo - write video into a drawable

SYNOPSIS
       #include <X11/extensions/Xvlib.h>

       int XvPutVideo(Display *dpy, XvPortID port, Drawable d, GC gc,
                      int vx, int vy, unsigned int vw, unsigned int vh,
                      int dx, int dy, unsigned int dw, unsigned int dh);

ARGUMENTS
       dpy            Specifies the connection to the X server.

       port           Defines the port from which to get video.

       d              Defines the drawable (window) into which video is to be written.

       gc             Defines the graphical context.  GC components are: subwindow-mode, clip-x-origin, clip-y-origin, and clip-mask.

       vx,vy,vw,vh    Define  the size and location of the source (video) region to be written.  vx and vy define the upper-left pixel of the region. vw and vh define the width and height, in pixels, of
                      the region.

       dx,dy,dw,dh    Define the location and size of the destination (drawable) region into which the video image is written.  dx and dy define the upper-left pixel of the region.  dw and dh define the
                      width and height, in pixels, of the region.

DESCRIPTION
       XvPutVideo  writes video into a drawable.  The position and size of the source (video) rectangle is specified by vx, vy, vw, and vh.  The position and size of the destination (drawable) rectangle
       is specified by dx, dy, dw, and dh.

       Video data is clipped to the bounds of the video encoding, scaled to the requested drawable region size (or the closest size supported) and clipped to the bounds of the drawable.

       If video is successfully initiated, an XvVideoNotify event with detail XvStarted is generated for the drawable.  If the port is already in use, its video is preempted, and if the new drawable  is
       different  than the old, an XvVideoNotify event with detail XvPreempted is generated for the old drawable.  If the port is grabbed by another client, this request is ignored, and an XvVideoNotify
       event with detail XvBusy is generated for the drawable. If the port is not receiving a valid video signal or if the video signal is interrupted while video is active a VideoNotify event with  de‚Äê
       tail XvHardError is generated for the drawable.

RETURN VALUES

       [XvBadAlloc]

DIAGNOSTICS
       [XvBadPort]
               Generated if the requested port does not exist.

       [BadDrawable]
               Generated if the requested drawable does not exist.

       [BadGC] Generated if the requested graphics context does not exist.
