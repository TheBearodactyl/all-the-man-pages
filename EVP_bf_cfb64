NAME
       EVP_bf_cbc, EVP_bf_cfb, EVP_bf_cfb64, EVP_bf_ecb, EVP_bf_ofb - EVP Blowfish cipher

SYNOPSIS
        #include <openssl/evp.h>

        const EVP_CIPHER *EVP_bf_cbc(void);
        const EVP_CIPHER *EVP_bf_cfb(void);
        const EVP_CIPHER *EVP_bf_cfb64(void);
        const EVP_CIPHER *EVP_bf_ecb(void);
        const EVP_CIPHER *EVP_bf_ofb(void);

DESCRIPTION
       The Blowfish encryption algorithm for EVP.

       This is a variable key length cipher.

       EVP_bf_cbc(), EVP_bf_cfb(), EVP_bf_cfb64(), EVP_bf_ecb(), EVP_bf_ofb()
           Blowfish encryption algorithm in CBC, CFB, ECB and OFB modes respectively.

RETURN VALUES
       These functions return an EVP_CIPHER structure that contains the implementation of the symmetric cipher. See EVP_CIPHER_meth_new(3) for details of the EVP_CIPHER structure.
