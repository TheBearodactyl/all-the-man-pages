NAME
       gnutls_pkcs7_import - API function

SYNOPSIS
       #include <gnutls/pkcs7.h>

       int gnutls_pkcs7_import(gnutls_pkcs7_t pkcs7, const gnutls_datum_t * data, gnutls_x509_crt_fmt_t format);

ARGUMENTS
       gnutls_pkcs7_t pkcs7
                   The data to store the parsed PKCS7.

       const gnutls_datum_t * data
                   The DER or PEM encoded PKCS7.

       gnutls_x509_crt_fmt_t format
                   One of DER or PEM

DESCRIPTION
       This function will convert the given DER or PEM encoded PKCS7 to the native gnutls_pkcs7_t format.  The output will be stored in
        pkcs7 . Any signed data that may be present inside the  pkcs7 structure, like certificates set by gnutls_pkcs7_set_crt(), will be freed and overwritten by this function.

       If the PKCS7 is PEM encoded it should have a header of "PKCS7".

RETURNS
       On success, GNUTLS_E_SUCCESS (0) is returned, otherwise a negative error value.
