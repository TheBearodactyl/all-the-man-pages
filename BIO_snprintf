BIO_PRINTF(3ssl)                    OpenSSL                   BIO_PRINTF(3ssl)

NAME
       BIO_printf, BIO_vprintf, BIO_snprintf, BIO_vsnprintf - formatted output
       to a BIO

SYNOPSIS
        #include <openssl/bio.h>

        int BIO_printf(BIO *bio, const char *format, ...);
        int BIO_vprintf(BIO *bio, const char *format, va_list args);

        int BIO_snprintf(char *buf, size_t n, const char *format, ...);
        int BIO_vsnprintf(char *buf, size_t n, const char *format, va_list args);

DESCRIPTION
       BIO_printf() is similar to the standard C printf() function, except
       that the output is sent to the specified BIO, bio, rather than standard
       output.  All common format specifiers are supported.

       BIO_vprintf() is similar to the vprintf() function found on many
       platforms, the output is sent to the specified BIO, bio, rather than
       standard output.  All common format specifiers are supported. The
       argument list args is a stdarg argument list.

       BIO_snprintf() is for platforms that do not have the common snprintf()
       function. It is like sprintf() except that the size parameter, n,
       specifies the size of the output buffer.

       BIO_vsnprintf() is to BIO_snprintf() as BIO_vprintf() is to
       BIO_printf().

RETURN VALUES
       All functions return the number of bytes written, or -1 on error.  For
       BIO_snprintf() and BIO_vsnprintf() this includes when the output buffer
       is too small.

NOTES
       Except when n is 0, both BIO_snprintf() and BIO_vsnprintf() always
       terminate their output with '\0'.  This includes cases where -1 is
       returned, such as when there is insufficient space to output the whole
       string.
