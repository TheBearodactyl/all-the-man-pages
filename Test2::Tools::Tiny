NAME
       Test2::Tools::Tiny - Tiny set of tools for unfortunate souls who cannot use Test2::Suite.

DESCRIPTION
       You should really look at Test2::Suite. This package is some very basic essential tools implemented using Test2. This exists only so that Test2 and other tools required by Test2::Suite can be
       tested. This is the package Test2 uses to test itself.

USE Test2::Suite INSTEAD
       Use Test2::Suite if at all possible.
