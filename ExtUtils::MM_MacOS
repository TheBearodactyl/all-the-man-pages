NAME
       ExtUtils::MM_MacOS - once produced Makefiles for MacOS Classic

SYNOPSIS
         # MM_MacOS no longer contains any code.  This is just a stub.

DESCRIPTION
       Once upon a time, MakeMaker could produce an approximation of a correct Makefile on MacOS Classic (MacPerl).  Due to a lack of maintainers, this fell out of sync with the rest of MakeMaker and
       hadn't worked in years.  Since there's little chance of it being repaired, MacOS Classic is fading away, and the code was icky to begin with, the code has been deleted to make maintenance easier.

       Anyone interested in resurrecting this file should pull the old version from the MakeMaker CVS repository and contact makemaker@perl.org.
