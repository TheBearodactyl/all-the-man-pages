NAME
       fwide - set and determine the orientation of a FILE stream

LIBRARY
       Standard C library (libc, -lc)

SYNOPSIS
       #include <wchar.h>

       int fwide(FILE *stream, int mode);

   Feature Test Macro Requirements for glibc (see feature_test_macros(7)):

       fwide():
           _XOPEN_SOURCE >= 500 || _ISOC99_SOURCE
               || _POSIX_C_SOURCE >= 200112L

DESCRIPTION
       When  mode is zero, the fwide() function determines the current orientation of stream.  It returns a positive value if stream is wide-character oriented, that is, if wide-character I/O is permit‐
       ted but char I/O is disallowed.  It returns a negative value if stream is byte oriented—that is, if char I/O is permitted but wide-character I/O is disallowed.  It returns zero if stream  has  no
       orientation  yet; in this case the next I/O operation might change the orientation (to byte oriented if it is a char I/O operation, or to wide-character oriented if it is a wide-character I/O op‐
       eration).

       Once a stream has an orientation, it cannot be changed and persists until the stream is closed.

       When mode is nonzero, the fwide() function first attempts to set stream's orientation (to wide-character oriented if mode is greater than 0, or to byte oriented if mode is less than 0).  It  then
       returns a value denoting the current orientation, as above.

RETURN VALUE
       The  fwide() function returns the stream's orientation, after possibly changing it.  A positive return value means wide-character oriented.  A negative return value means byte oriented.  A return
       value of zero means undecided.

STANDARDS
       C11, POSIX.1-2008.

HISTORY
       POSIX.1-2001, C99.

NOTES
       Wide-character output to a byte oriented stream can be performed through the fprintf(3) function with the %lc and %ls directives.

       Char oriented output to a wide-character oriented stream can be performed through the fwprintf(3) function with the %c and %s directives.

NAME
       fwide — set stream orientation

SYNOPSIS
       #include <stdio.h>
       #include <wchar.h>

       int fwide(FILE *stream, int mode);

DESCRIPTION
       The functionality described on this reference page is aligned with the ISO C standard. Any conflict between the requirements described here and the ISO C standard is unintentional. This volume of
       POSIX.1‐2017 defers to the ISO C standard.

       The  fwide()  function  shall determine the orientation of the stream pointed to by stream.  If mode is greater than zero, the function first attempts to make the stream wide-oriented. If mode is
       less than zero, the function first attempts to make the stream byte-oriented. Otherwise, mode is zero and the function does not alter the orientation of the stream.

       If the orientation of the stream has already been determined, fwide() shall not change it.

       The fwide() function shall not change the setting of errno if successful.

       Since no return value is reserved to indicate an error, an application wishing to check for error situations should set errno to 0, then call fwide(), then check errno, and if it is non-zero, as‐
       sume an error has occurred.

RETURN VALUE
       The  fwide()  function shall return a value greater than zero if, after the call, the stream has wide-orientation, a value less than zero if the stream has byte-orientation, or zero if the stream
       has no orientation.

ERRORS
       The fwide() function may fail if:

       EBADF  The stream argument is not a valid stream.

       The following sections are informative.

EXAMPLES
       None.

APPLICATION USAGE
       A call to fwide() with mode set to zero can be used to determine the current orientation of a stream.

RATIONALE
       None.

FUTURE DIRECTIONS
       None.
