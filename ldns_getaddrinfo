NAME
       ldns_getaddrinfo - mimic libc getaddrinfo

SYNOPSIS
       #include <stdint.h>
       #include <stdbool.h>

       #include <ldns/ldns.h>

       uint16_t ldns_getaddrinfo(ldns_resolver *res, const ldns_rdf *node, ldns_rr_class c, ldns_rr_list **list);

DESCRIPTION
       ldns_getaddrinfo() This function is a wrapper function for ldns_get_rr_list_name_by_addr and ldns_get_rr_list_addr_by_name. It's name is from the getaddrinfo() library call. It tries to mimic
              that call, but without the lowlevel stuff.
              res: The resolver. If this value is NULL then a resolver will be created by ldns_getaddrinfo.
              node: the name or ip address to look up
              c: the class to look in
              list: put the found RR's in this list
              Returns the number of RR found.
