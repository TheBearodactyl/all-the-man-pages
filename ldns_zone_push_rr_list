NAME
       ldns_zone_push_rr, ldns_zone_push_rr_list - add rr's to a ldns_zone

SYNOPSIS
       #include <stdint.h>
       #include <stdbool.h>

       #include <ldns/ldns.h>

       bool ldns_zone_push_rr(ldns_zone *z, ldns_rr *rr);

       bool ldns_zone_push_rr_list(ldns_zone *z, const ldns_rr_list *list);

DESCRIPTION
       ldns_zone_push_rr() push an single rr to a zone structure. This function use pointer copying, so the rr_list structure inside z is modified!
              z: the zone to add to
              rr: the rr to add
              Returns a true on success otherwise false

       ldns_zone_push_rr_list() push an rrlist to a zone structure. This function use pointer copying, so the rr_list structure inside z is modified!
