NAME
       CURLINFO_PRETRANSFER_TIME - get the time until the file transfer start

SYNOPSIS
       #include <curl/curl.h>

       CURLcode curl_easy_getinfo(CURL *handle, CURLINFO_PRETRANSFER_TIME,
                                  double *timep);

DESCRIPTION
       Pass a pointer to a double to receive the time, in seconds, it took from the start until the file transfer is just about to begin.

       This  time-stamp  includes all pre-transfer commands and negotiations that are specific to the particular protocol(s) involved. It includes the sending of the protocol- specific protocol instruc‚Äê
       tions that triggers a transfer.

       When a redirect is followed, the time from each request is added together.

       See also the TIMES overview in the curl_easy_getinfo(3) man page.

         res = curl_easy_perform(curl);
         if(CURLE_OK == res) {
           res = curl_easy_getinfo(curl, CURLINFO_PRETRANSFER_TIME, &pretransfer);
           if(CURLE_OK == res) {
             printf("Time: %.1f", pretransfer);
           }
