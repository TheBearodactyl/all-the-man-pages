NAME
       io_uring_register_buffers - register buffers for fixed buffer operations

SYNOPSIS
       #include <liburing.h>

       int io_uring_register_buffers(struct io_uring *ring,
                                     const struct iovec *iovecs,
                                     unsigned nr_iovecs);

       int io_uring_register_buffers_sparse(struct io_uring *ring,
                                     unsigned nr_iovecs);

DESCRIPTION
       The io_uring_register_buffers(3) function registers nr_iovecs number of buffers defined by the array iovecs belonging to the ring.

       The  io_uring_register_buffers_sparse(3)  function  registers  nr_iovecs  empty  buffers  belonging  to the ring.  These buffers must be updated before use, using eg io_uring_register_buffers_up‚Äê
       date_tag(3).

       After the caller has registered the buffers, they can be used with one of the fixed buffers functions.

       Registered buffers is an optimization that is useful in conjunction with O_DIRECT reads and writes, where it maps the specified range into the kernel once when the  buffer  is  registered  rather
       than doing a map and unmap for each IO every time IO is performed to that region. Additionally, it also avoids manipulating the page reference counts for each IO.

RETURN VALUE
       On success io_uring_register_buffers(3) and io_uring_register_buffers_sparse(3) return 0. On failure they return -errno.
