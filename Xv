NAME
       Xv - X Window System video extension

DESCRIPTION
       The X Video Extension (Xv) extension provides support for video adaptors attached to an X display.  It takes the approach that a display may have one or more video adaptors, each of which has one
       or more ports through which independent video streams pass.

       An adaptor may be able to display video in a drawable, capture video from a drawable, or both.  It translates between video encoding (NTSC, PAL, SECAM, etc...) and drawable format (depth and vis‐
       ual-id pair). An adaptor may support multiple video encodings and/or multiple drawable formats.

       Clients  use Xv(3) to gain access and manage sharing of a display's video resources.  Typically, a client will use XvQueryExtension(3) to determine the status of the extension, XvQueryAdaptors(3)
       to get a description of what video adaptors exist, and XvQueryEncodings(3) to get a description of what video encodings an adaptor supports.

       Once a client has determined what video resources are available, it is free to put video into a drawable or get video from a drawable, according the capabilities supported.  Clients can select to
       receive events when video activity changes in a drawable and when port attributes have changed.

       The  Xv  protocol  version  2.2 and later is extended to support client images in alternate colorspaces (XvImages).  Xv adaptors which are capable of displaying XvImages will have the XvImageMask
       field set in the type field of the XvAdaptorInfo.  XvImage formats supported by the port may be queried with XvListImageFormats(3).  XvImages may be created with the help of  XvCreateImage(3)  or
       XvShmCreateImage(3); XvImages may be displayed with XvPutImage(3) or XvShmPutImage(3).  The Port attributes of the port specified in the Xv(Shm)PutImage command will be valid for the image opera‐
       tion when applicable.  There will be a port encoding with the name "XV_IMAGE".  The width and height of that encoding will indicate the maximum source image size.
