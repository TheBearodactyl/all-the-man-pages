NAME
       ares_fds - return file descriptors to select on

SYNOPSIS
       #include <ares.h>

       int ares_fds(ares_channel channel,
                    fd_set *read_fds,
                 fd_set *write_fds)

DESCRIPTION
       The  ares_fds(3)  function  retrieves  the set of file descriptors which the calling application should select on for reading and writing for the processing of name service queries pending on the
       name service channel identified by channel.

       File descriptors will be set in the file descriptor sets pointed to by read_fds and write_fds as appropriate.  File descriptors already set in read_fds and write_fds will remain set;  initializa‚Äê
       tion of the file descriptor sets (using FD_ZERO) is the responsibility of the caller.

RETURN VALUES
       ares_fds(3) returns a value that is one greater than the number of the highest socket set in either read_fds or write_fds.  If no queries are active, ares_fds(3) returns 0.
