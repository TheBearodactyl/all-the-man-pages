NAME
       XkbLatchModifiers -  Latches and unlatches any of the eight real keyboard modifiers

SYNOPSIS
       Bool XkbLatchModifiers (Display *display, unsigned int device_spec, unsigned int affect, unsigned int values);

ARGUMENTS
       display
              connection to the X server

       device_spec
              device ID, or XkbUseCoreKbd

       affect mask of real modifiers whose lock state is to change

       values 1 => lock, 0 => unlock; only for modifiers selected by affect

DESCRIPTION
       XkbLatchModifiers sends a request to the server to latch the real modifiers selected by both affect and values and to unlatch the real modifiers selected by affect , but not selected by values.

       XkbLatchModifiers does not wait for a reply from the server. It returns True if the request was sent, and False otherwise.

       The functions in this section that change the use of modifiers use a mask in the parameter affect. It is a bitwise inclusive OR of the legal modifier masks:
