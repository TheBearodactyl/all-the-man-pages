NAME
       hwloc-ps - List currently-running processes or threads that are bound

SYNOPSIS
       hwloc-ps [options]

OPTIONS
       -a        List all processes, even those that are not bound to any specific part of the machine.

       --pid <pid>
                 Only show process of PID <pid>, even if it is not bound to any specific part of the machine.

       --name <name>
                 Only show processes whose name contains <name>, even if they are not bound to any specific part of the machine.  This is not supported on all operating systems.

       --uid <uid>
                 Only  show  processes  of  the user whose UID is <uid>, or processes of all users if all is given.  By default, only processes of the current user are displayed.  This is currently only
                 supported on Linux.

       -p --physical
                 Report OS/physical indexes instead of logical indexes

       -l --logical
                 Report logical indexes instead of physical/OS indexes (default)

       -c --cpuset
                 Show process bindings as cpusets instead of objects.

       -t --threads
                 Show threads inside processes.  If -a is given as well, list all threads within each process.  Otherwise, show all threads inside each process where at least one thread is bound.   This
                 is currently only supported on Linux.

       --single-ancestor
                 When the object is bound to different objects, report their common ancestor (even if it may be larger than the actual binding).

       -e --get-last-cpu-location
                 Report   the  last processors where the process/thread ran.  Note that the result may already be outdated when reported since the operating system may move the tasks to other processors
                 at any time according to the binding.

       --disallowed
                 Include objects disallowed by administrative limitations.

       --pid-cmd <cmd>
                 Append the output of the given command to each PID line.  For each displayed process ID, execute the command <cmd> <pid> and append the first line of its output to the regular  hwloc-ps
                 line.

       --pid-cmd env=<name>
                 On Linux, try to read the value of environment variable name in each process and display it at the end of the line.

       --pid-cmd mpirank
                 On Linux, try to find the process MPI rank (by querying some widespread environment variables) and display it at the end of the line.

       --json-server
                 Run the tool as a JSON server that waits for other process' requests on a port and sends back binding information.  See contrib/hwloc-ps.www/ for details.

       --json-port <port>
                 Use the given port number instead of the default 8888.

       -v --verbose
                 Increase verbosity of the JSON server.

       --short-name
                 Show only the process short name instead of the path.

       --version Report version and exit.

       -h --help Display help message and exit.

DESCRIPTION
       By default, hwloc-ps lists only those currently-running processes that are bound. If -t is given, processes that are not bound but contain at least one bound thread are also displayed, as well as
       all their threads.

       hwloc-ps displays process identifier, command-line and binding.  The binding may be reported as objects or cpusets.

       By default, process bindings are restricted to the currently available topology. If some processes are bound to processors that are not available to the current process, they are  ignored  unless
       --disallowed is given.

       The output is a plain list. If you wish to annotate the hierarchical topology with processes so as to see how they are actual distributed on the machine, you might want to use lstopo --ps instead
       (which also only shows processes that are bound).

       The -a switch can be used to show all processes, if desired.

EXAMPLES
       If a process is bound, it appears in the default output:

           $ hwloc-ps
           4759  Core:0         myprogram

       If a process is bound on two cores of a larger package, the output will show these cores.  Option --single-ancestor will rather return the package even if it is actually larger than  the  binding
       here (the process is not bound to Core:0 of Package:0):

           $ hwloc-ps
           4863        Core:1 Core:2   myprogram
           $ hwloc-ps --single-ancestor
           4863        Package:0       myprogram

       If a process is not bound but 3 of his 4 threads are bound, it only appears in the thread-aware output (or if explicitly selected):

           $ hwloc-ps

           $ hwloc-ps -t
           4759  Machine:0      myprogram
            4759 Machine:0
            4761 PU:0
            4762 PU:2
            4765 PU:1

           $ hwloc-ps --pid 4759
           4759  Machine:0      myprogram

       On Linux, hwloc-ps may also display some process specific environment variable at the end of the line. This is for instance useful for identify MPI ranks among processes:

           $ hwloc-ps --pid-cmd env=OMPI_COMM_WORLD_RANK
           29093 PU:0 myprogram OMPI_COMM_WORLD_RANK=0
           29094 PU:2 myprogram OMPI_COMM_WORLD_RANK=1
           29095 PU:1 myprogram OMPI_COMM_WORLD_RANK=2
           29096 PU:3 myprogram OMPI_COMM_WORLD_RANK=3

       Some widespread MPI specific environment variables (OMPI_COMM_WORLD_RANK, PMIX_RANK, PMI_RANK and SLURM_PROCID) are actually directly recognized by hwloc-ps when requesting the mpirank command:

           $ hwloc-ps --pid-cmd mpirank
           29093 PU:0 myprogram PMIX_RANK=0
           29094 PU:2 myprogram PMIX_RANK=1
           29095 PU:1 myprogram PMIX_RANK=2
           29096 PU:3 myprogram PMIX_RANK=3

       Beside reading environment variables, hwloc-ps may also append the output of a custom program. Again, for reading the Open MPI process rank:

           $ hwloc-ps --pid-cmd myscript
           29093 PU:0 myprogram OMPI_COMM_WORLD_RANK=0
           29094 PU:2 myprogram OMPI_COMM_WORLD_RANK=1
           29095 PU:1 myprogram OMPI_COMM_WORLD_RANK=2
           29096 PU:3 myprogram OMPI_COMM_WORLD_RANK=3

       where myscript is a shell script doing:

           #!/bin/sh
           cat /proc/$1/environ 2>/dev/null | xargs --null --max-args=1 echo | grep OMPI_COMM_WORLD_RANK
