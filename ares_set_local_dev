NAME
       ares_set_local_dev - Bind to a specific network device when creating sockets.

SYNOPSIS
       #include <ares.h>

       void ares_set_local_dev(ares_channel channel, const char* local_dev_name)

DESCRIPTION
       The  ares_set_local_dev  function  causes  all  future  sockets to be bound to this device with SO_BINDTODEVICE.  This forces communications to go over a certain interface, which can be useful on
       multi-homed machines.  This option is only supported on Linux, and root privileges are required for the option to work.  If SO_BINDTODEVICE is not supported or the setsocktop call fails (probably
       because of permissions), the error is silently ignored.

SEE ALSO
       ares_set_local_ip4(3) ares_set_local_ip6(3)

NOTES
       This function was added in c-ares 1.7.4
