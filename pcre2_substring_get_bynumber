NAME
       PCRE2 - Perl-compatible regular expressions (revised API)

SYNOPSIS

       #include <pcre2.h>

       int pcre2_substring_get_bynumber(pcre2_match_data *match_data,
         uint32_t number, PCRE2_UCHAR **bufferptr, PCRE2_SIZE *bufflen);

DESCRIPTION

       This  is  a convenience function for extracting a captured substring by
       number into newly acquired memory. The arguments are:

         match_data    The match data for the match
         number        Number of the required substring
         bufferptr     Where to put the string pointer
         bufflen       Where to put the string length

       The memory in which the substring is placed is obtained by calling  the
       same memory allocation function that was used for the match data block.
       The convenience function pcre2_substring_free() can be used to free  it
       when it is no longer needed. The yield of the function is zero for suc‚Äê
       cess or one of the following error numbers:

         PCRE2_ERROR_NOSUBSTRING   there are no groups of that number
         PCRE2_ERROR_UNAVAILBLE    the ovector was too small for that group
         PCRE2_ERROR_UNSET         the group did not participate in the match
         PCRE2_ERROR_NOMEMORY      memory could not be obtained

       There is a complete description of the PCRE2 native API in the pcre2api
       page and a description of the POSIX API in the pcre2posix page.
