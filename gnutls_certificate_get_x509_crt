NAME
       gnutls_certificate_get_x509_crt - API function

SYNOPSIS
       #include <gnutls/gnutls.h>

       int gnutls_certificate_get_x509_crt(gnutls_certificate_credentials_t res, unsigned index, gnutls_x509_crt_t ** crt_list, unsigned * crt_list_size);

ARGUMENTS
       gnutls_certificate_credentials_t res
                   is a gnutls_certificate_credentials_t type.

       unsigned index
                   The index of the certificate list to obtain.

       gnutls_x509_crt_t ** crt_list
                   Where to store the certificate list.

       unsigned * crt_list_size
                   Will hold the number of certificates.

DESCRIPTION
       Obtains  a X.509 certificate list that has been stored in  res with one of gnutls_certificate_set_x509_key(), gnutls_certificate_set_key(), gnutls_certificate_set_x509_key_file(), gnutls_certifi‐
       cate_set_x509_key_file2(), gnutls_certificate_set_x509_key_mem(), or  gnutls_certificate_set_x509_key_mem2().  Each  certificate  in  the  returned  certificate  list  must  be  deallocated  with
       gnutls_x509_crt_deinit(), and the list itself must be freed with gnutls_free().

       The  index matches the return value of gnutls_certificate_set_x509_key() and friends functions, when the GNUTLS_CERTIFICATE_API_V2 flag is set.

       If there is no certificate with the given index, GNUTLS_E_REQUESTED_DATA_NOT_AVAILABLE is returned. If the certificate with the given index is not a X.509 certificate, GNUTLS_E_INVALID_REQUEST is
       returned. The returned certificates must be deinitialized after use, and the  crt_list pointer must be freed using gnutls_free().

RETURNS
       GNUTLS_E_SUCCESS (0) on success, or a negative error code.

SINCE
       3.4.0
