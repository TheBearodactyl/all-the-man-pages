NAME
       dane_query_to_raw_tlsa - API function

SYNOPSIS
       #include <gnutls/dane.h>

       int dane_query_to_raw_tlsa(dane_query_t q, unsigned int * data_entries, char *** dane_data, int ** dane_data_len, int * secure, int * bogus);

ARGUMENTS
       dane_query_t q
                   The query result structure

       unsigned int * data_entries
                   Pointer set to the number of entries in the query

       char *** dane_data
                   Pointer to contain an array of DNS rdata items, terminated with a NULL pointer; caller must guarantee that the referenced data remains valid until dane_query_deinit() is called.

       int ** dane_data_len
                   Pointer to contain the length n bytes of the dane_data items

       int * secure
                   Pointer set true if the result is validated securely, false if validation failed or the domain queried has no security info

       int * bogus Pointer set true if the result was not secure due to a security failure

DESCRIPTION
       This function will provide the DANE data from the query response.

       The pointers dane_data and dane_data_len are allocated with gnutls_malloc() to contain the data from the query result structure (individual
        dane_data items simply point to the original data and are not allocated separately).  The returned  dane_data are only valid during the lifetime of  q .

RETURNS
       On success, DANE_E_SUCCESS (0) is returned, otherwise a negative error value.
