NAME
       sd_bus_set_exit_on_disconnect, sd_bus_get_exit_on_disconnect - Control
       the exit behavior when the bus object disconnects

SYNOPSIS
       #include <systemd/sd-bus.h>

       int sd_bus_set_exit_on_disconnect(sd_bus *bus, int b);

       int sd_bus_get_exit_on_disconnect(sd_bus *bus);

DESCRIPTION
       sd_bus_set_exit_on_disconnect() may be used to configure the exit
       behavior when the given bus object disconnects. If b is zero, no
       special logic is executed when the bus object disconnects. If b is
       non-zero, the behavior on disconnect depends on whether the bus object
       is attached to an event loop or not. If the bus object is attached to
       an event loop (see sd_bus_attach_event(3)), the event loop is closed
       when the bus object disconnects (as if calling sd_event_exit(3)).
       Otherwise, exit(3) is called. The exit code passed to sd_event_exit()
       and exit() is EXIT_FAILURE. If the bus object has already disconnected
       when enabling the exit behavior, the exit behavior is executed
       immediately. By default, the exit behavior is disabled.

       sd_bus_get_exit_on_disconnect() returns whether the exit on disconnect
       behavior is enabled for the given bus object.

RETURN VALUE
       On success, sd_bus_set_exit_on_disconnect() returns a non-negative
       integer. On failure, it returns a negative errno-style error code.

       sd_bus_get_exit_on_disconnect() returns a positive integer if the exit
       on disconnect behavior is enabled. Otherwise, it returns zero.

   Errors
       Returned errors may indicate the following problems:

       -EINVAL
           A required parameter was NULL.

       -ENOPKG
           The bus object could not be resolved.

       -ECHILD
           The bus connection was created in a different process.

NOTES
       These APIs are implemented as a shared library, which can be compiled
       and linked to with the libsystemd pkg-config(1) file.
