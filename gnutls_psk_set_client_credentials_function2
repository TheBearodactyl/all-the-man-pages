NAME
       gnutls_psk_set_client_credentials_function2 - API function

SYNOPSIS
       #include <gnutls/gnutls.h>

       void gnutls_psk_set_client_credentials_function2(gnutls_psk_client_credentials_t          cred, gnutls_psk_client_credentials_function2          * func);

ARGUMENTS
       gnutls_psk_client_credentials_t          cred
                   is a gnutls_psk_server_credentials_t type.

       gnutls_psk_client_credentials_function2          * func
                   is the callback function

DESCRIPTION
       This  function  can  be  used to set a callback to retrieve the username and password for client PSK authentication.  The callback's function form is: int (*callback)(gnutls_session_t, gnutls_da‐
       tum_t* username, gnutls_datum_t* key);

       This callback function has the same semantics as that of gnutls_psk_set_client_credentials_function(), but it allows non-string usernames to be used.

       The  username and  key ->data must be allocated using gnutls_malloc().  The  username should be an ASCII string or UTF-8 string. In case of a UTF-8 string it is recommended to  be  following  the
       PRECIS framework for usernames (rfc8265).

       The callback function will be called once per handshake.

       The callback function should return 0 on success.  -1 indicates an error.
