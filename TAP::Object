           use strict;

           use base 'TAP::Object';

           # new() implementation by TAP::Object
           sub _initialize {
               my ( $self, @args) = @_;
               # initialize your object

DESCRIPTION
       "TAP::Object" provides a default constructor and exception model for all "TAP::*" classes.  Exceptions are raised using Carp.

METHODS
   Class Methods
       "new"

       Create a new object.  Any arguments passed to "new" will be passed on to the "_initialize" method.  Returns a new object.

   Instance Methods
       "_initialize"

       Initializes a new object.  This method is a stub by default, you should override it as appropriate.

       Note: "new" expects you to return $self or raise an exception.  See "_croak", and Carp.

       "_croak"

       Raise an exception using "croak" from Carp, eg:

           $self->_croak( 'why me?', 'aaarrgh!' );

       May also be called as a class method.

           $class->_croak( 'this works too' );

       "_confess"

       Raise an exception using "confess" from Carp, eg:

           $self->_confess( 'why me?', 'aaarrgh!' );

       May also be called as a class method.

           $class->_confess( 'this works too' );

       "_construct"

       Create a new instance of the specified class.

       "mk_methods"

       Create simple getter/setters.
