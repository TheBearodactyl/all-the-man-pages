NAME
       sd_bus_get_name_creds, sd_bus_get_owner_creds - Query bus client
       credentials

SYNOPSIS
       #include <systemd/sd-bus.h>

       int sd_bus_get_name_creds(sd_bus *bus, const char *name, uint64_t mask,
                                 sd_bus_creds **creds);

       int sd_bus_get_owner_creds(sd_bus *bus, uint64_t mask,
                                  sd_bus_creds **creds);

DESCRIPTION
       sd_bus_get_name_creds() queries the credentials of the bus client
       identified by name. The mask parameter is a combo of SD_BUS_CREDS_*
       flags that indicate which credential info the caller is interested in.
       See sd_bus_creds_new_from_pid(3) for a list of possible flags. On
       success, creds contains a new sd_bus_creds instance with the requested
       information. Ownership of this instance belongs to the caller and it
       should be freed once no longer needed by calling sd_bus_creds_unref(3).

       sd_bus_get_owner_creds() queries the credentials of the creator of the
       given bus. The mask and creds parameters behave the same as in
       sd_bus_get_name_creds().

RETURN VALUE
       On success, these functions return a non-negative integer. On failure,
       they return a negative errno-style error code.

   Errors
       Returned errors may indicate the following problems:

       -EINVAL
           An argument is invalid.

       -ENOPKG
           The bus cannot be resolved.

       -EPERM
           The bus has already been started.

       -ECHILD
           The bus was created in a different process.

       -ENOMEM
           Memory allocation failed.

NOTES
       These APIs are implemented as a shared library, which can be compiled
       and linked to with the libsystemd pkg-config(1) file.
