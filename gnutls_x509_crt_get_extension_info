NAME
       gnutls_x509_crt_get_extension_info - API function

SYNOPSIS
       #include <gnutls/x509.h>

       int gnutls_x509_crt_get_extension_info(gnutls_x509_crt_t cert, unsigned indx, void * oid, size_t * oid_size, unsigned int * critical);

ARGUMENTS
       gnutls_x509_crt_t cert
                   should contain a gnutls_x509_crt_t type

       unsigned indx
                   Specifies which extension OID to send. Use (0) to get the first one.

       void * oid  a pointer to a structure to hold the OID

       size_t * oid_size
                   initially holds the maximum size of  oid , on return holds actual size of  oid .

       unsigned int * critical
                   output variable with critical flag, may be NULL.

DESCRIPTION
       This  function  will  return  the  requested  extension  OID  in  the  certificate,  and  the  critical  flag  for  it.   The extension OID will be stored as a string in the provided buffer.  Use
       gnutls_x509_crt_get_extension() to extract the data.

       If the buffer provided is not long enough to hold the output, then
        oid_size is updated and GNUTLS_E_SHORT_MEMORY_BUFFER will be returned. The  oid returned will be null terminated, although
        oid_size will not account for the trailing null (the latter is not true for GnuTLS prior to 3.6.0).

RETURNS
       On success, GNUTLS_E_SUCCESS (0) is returned, otherwise a negative error code is returned.  If you have reached the last extension  available  GNUTLS_E_REQUESTED_DATA_NOT_AVAILABLE  will  be  re‐
       turned.
