NAME
       FcFontSort - Return list of matching fonts

SYNOPSIS
       #include <fontconfig/fontconfig.h>

       FcFontSet * FcFontSort (FcConfig *config, FcPattern *p, FcBool trim, FcCharSet **csp, FcResult *result);

DESCRIPTION
       Returns  the  list  of  fonts sorted by closeness to p.  If trim is FcTrue, elements in the list which don't include Unicode coverage not provided by earlier elements in the list are elided.  The
       union of Unicode coverage of all of the fonts is returned in csp, if csp is not NULL.  This function should be called only after FcConfigSubstitute and FcDefaultSubstitute have been called for p;
       otherwise the results will not be correct.

       The  returned  FcFontSet references FcPattern structures which may be shared by the return value from multiple FcFontSort calls, applications must not modify these patterns.  Instead, they should
       be passed, along with p to FcFontRenderPrepare which combines them into a complete pattern.

       The FcFontSet returned by FcFontSort is destroyed by calling FcFontSetDestroy.  If config is NULL, the current configuration is used.
