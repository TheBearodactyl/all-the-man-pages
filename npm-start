NAME
       npm-start - Start a package

   Synopsis
         npm start [-- <args>]

   Description
       This runs a predefined command specified in the "start" property of a package's "scripts" object.

       If the "scripts" object does not define a  "start" property, npm will run node server.js.

       Note that this is different from the default node behavior of running the file specified in a package's "main" attribute when evoking with node .

       As of npm@2.0.0 https://blog.npmjs.org/post/98131109725/npm-2-0-0, you can use custom arguments when executing scripts. Refer to npm help run-script for more details.

   Example
         {
           "scripts": {
             "start": "node foo.js"
           }
         }

         npm start

         > npm@x.x.x start
         > node foo.js

         (foo.js output would be here)

   Configuration
   ignore-scripts
       • Default: false

       • Type: Boolean

       If true, npm does not run scripts specified in package.json files.

       Note that commands explicitly intended to run a particular script, such as npm start, npm stop, npm restart, npm test, and npm run-script will still run their intended script if ignore-scripts is
       set, but they will not run any pre- or post-scripts.

   script-shell
       • Default: '/bin/sh' on POSIX systems, 'cmd.exe' on Windows

       • Type: null or String

       The shell to use for scripts run with the npm exec, npm run and npm init <package-spec> commands.
