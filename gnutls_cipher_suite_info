NAME
       gnutls_cipher_suite_info - API function

SYNOPSIS
       #include <gnutls/gnutls.h>

       const char * gnutls_cipher_suite_info(size_t idx, unsigned char * cs_id, gnutls_kx_algorithm_t * kx, gnutls_cipher_algorithm_t * cipher, gnutls_mac_algorithm_t * mac, gnutls_protocol_t * min_ver‐
       sion);

ARGUMENTS
       size_t idx  index of cipher suite to get information about, starts on 0.

       unsigned char * cs_id
                   output buffer with room for 2 bytes, indicating cipher suite value

       gnutls_kx_algorithm_t * kx
                   output variable indicating key exchange algorithm, or NULL.

       gnutls_cipher_algorithm_t * cipher
                   output variable indicating cipher, or NULL.

       gnutls_mac_algorithm_t * mac
                   output variable indicating MAC algorithm, or NULL.

       gnutls_protocol_t * min_version
                   output variable indicating TLS protocol version, or NULL.

DESCRIPTION
       Get information about supported cipher suites.  Use the function iteratively to get information about all supported cipher suites.  Call with idx=0 to get information about  first  cipher  suite,
       then idx=1 and so on until the function returns NULL.

RETURNS
       the name of  idx cipher suite, and set the information about the cipher suite in the output variables.  If  idx is out of bounds, NULL is returned.
