NAME
       nm-online - ask NetworkManager whether the network is connected

SYNOPSIS
       nm-online [OPTIONS...]

DESCRIPTION
       nm-online is a utility to find out whether we are online. It is done by asking NetworkManager about its status. When run, nm-online waits until NetworkManager reports an active connection, or
       specified timeout expires. On exit, the returned status code should be checked (see the return codes below).

       This tool is not very useful to call directly. It is however used by NetworkManager-wait-online.service with --wait-for-startup argument (see NetworkManager-wait-online.service(8)).

       By default, connections have the ipv4.may-fail and ipv6.may-fail properties set to yes; this means that NetworkManager waits for one of the two address families to complete configuration before
       considering the connection activated. If you need a specific address family configured before network-online.target is reached, set the corresponding may-fail property to no.

OPTIONS
       -h | --help
           Print help information.

       -q | --quiet
           Don't print anything.

       -s | --wait-for-startup
           Wait for NetworkManager startup to complete, rather than waiting for network connectivity specifically. Startup is considered complete once NetworkManager has activated (or attempted to
           activate) every auto-activate connection which is available given the current network state. This corresponds to the moment when NetworkManager logs "startup complete". This mode is generally
           only useful at boot time. After startup has completed, nm-online -s will just return immediately, regardless of the current network state.

           There are various ways to affect when startup complete is reached. For details see NetworkManager-wait-online.service(8).

       -t | --timeout seconds
           Time to wait for a connection, in seconds. If the option is not provided, the environment variable NM_ONLINE_TIMEOUT is honored. The default timeout is 30 seconds.

       -x | --exit
           Exit immediately if NetworkManager is not running or connecting.

EXIT STATUS
       nm-online exits with status 0 if it succeeds, a value greater than 0 is returned if an error occurs.

       0
           Success â€“ already online or connection established within given timeout.

       1
           Offline or not online within given timeout.

       2
           Unknown or unspecified error.
