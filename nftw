       nftw():
           _XOPEN_SOURCE >= 500

DESCRIPTION
       nftw() walks through the directory tree that is located under the directory dirpath, and calls fn() once for each entry in the tree.  By default, directories are handled before the files and sub‐
       directories they contain (preorder traversal).

       To avoid using up all of the calling process's file descriptors, nopenfd specifies the maximum number of directories that nftw() will hold open simultaneously.   When  the  search  depth  exceeds
       this, nftw() will become slower because directories have to be closed and reopened.  nftw() uses at most one file descriptor for each level in the directory tree.

       For  each  entry  found in the tree, nftw() calls fn() with four arguments: fpath, sb, typeflag, and ftwbuf.  fpath is the pathname of the entry, and is expressed either as a pathname relative to
       the calling process's current working directory at the time of the call to nftw(), if dirpath was expressed as a relative pathname, or as an absolute pathname, if dirpath was expressed as an  ab‐
       solute pathname.  sb is a pointer to the stat structure returned by a call to stat(2) for fpath.

       The typeflag argument passed to fn() is an integer that has one of the following values:

       FTW_F  fpath is a regular file.

       FTW_D  fpath is a directory.

       FTW_DNR
              fpath is a directory which can't be read.

       FTW_DP fpath  is  a  directory,  and  FTW_DEPTH was specified in flags.  (If FTW_DEPTH was not specified in flags, then directories will always be visited with typeflag set to FTW_D.)  All of the
              files and subdirectories within fpath have been processed.

       FTW_NS The stat(2) call failed on fpath, which is not a symbolic link.  The probable cause for this is that the caller had read permission on the parent directory,  so  that  the  filename  fpath
              could be seen, but did not have execute permission, so that the file could not be reached for stat(2).  The contents of the buffer pointed to by sb are undefined.

       FTW_SL fpath is a symbolic link, and FTW_PHYS was set in flags.

       FTW_SLN
              fpath  is a symbolic link pointing to a nonexistent file.  (This occurs only if FTW_PHYS is not set.)  In this case the sb argument passed to fn() contains information returned by perform‐
              ing lstat(2) on the "dangling" symbolic link.  (But see BUGS.)

       The fourth argument (ftwbuf) that nftw() supplies when calling fn() is a pointer to a structure of type FTW:

           struct FTW {
               int base;
               int level;
           };

       base is the offset of the filename (i.e., basename component) in the pathname given in fpath.  level is the depth of fpath in the directory tree, relative to the root of the tree (dirpath,  which
       has depth 0).

       To  stop  the tree walk, fn() returns a nonzero value; this value will become the return value of nftw().  As long as fn() returns 0, nftw() will continue either until it has traversed the entire
       tree, in which case it will return zero, or until it encounters an error (such as a malloc(3) failure), in which case it will return -1.

       Because nftw() uses dynamic data structures, the only safe way to exit out of a tree walk is to return a nonzero value from fn().  To allow a signal to terminate the walk without causing a memory
       leak, have the handler set a global flag that is checked by fn().  Don't use longjmp(3) unless the program is going to terminate.

       The flags argument of nftw() is formed by ORing zero or more of the following flags:

       FTW_ACTIONRETVAL (since glibc 2.3.3)
              If this glibc-specific flag is set, then nftw() handles the return value from fn() differently.  fn() should return one of the following values:

              FTW_CONTINUE
                     Instructs nftw() to continue normally.

              FTW_SKIP_SIBLINGS
                     If fn() returns this value, then siblings of the current entry will be skipped, and processing continues in the parent.

              FTW_SKIP_SUBTREE
                     If fn() is called with an entry that is a directory (typeflag is FTW_D), this return value will prevent objects within that directory from being passed as arguments to fn().  nftw()
                     continues processing with the next sibling of the directory.

              FTW_STOP
                     Causes nftw() to return immediately with the return value FTW_STOP.

              Other return values could be associated with new actions in the future; fn() should not return values other than those listed above.

              The feature test macro _GNU_SOURCE must be defined (before including any header files) in order to obtain the definition of FTW_ACTIONRETVAL from <ftw.h>.

       FTW_CHDIR
              If set, do a chdir(2) to each directory before handling its contents.  This is useful if the program needs to perform some action in the directory in which fpath resides.  (Specifying this
              flag has no effect on the pathname that is passed in the fpath argument of fn.)

       FTW_DEPTH
              If  set, do a post-order traversal, that is, call fn() for the directory itself after handling the contents of the directory and its subdirectories.  (By default, each directory is handled
              before its contents.)

       FTW_MOUNT
              If set, stay within the same filesystem (i.e., do not cross mount points).

       FTW_PHYS
              If set, do not follow symbolic links.  (This is what you want.)  If not set, symbolic links are followed, but no file is reported twice.

              If FTW_PHYS is not set, but FTW_DEPTH is set, then the function fn() is never called for a directory that would be a descendant of itself.

   ftw()
       ftw() is an older function that offers a subset of the functionality of nftw().  The notable differences are as follows:

       •  ftw() has no flags argument.  It behaves the same as when nftw() is called with flags specified as zero.

       •  The callback function, fn(), is not supplied with a fourth argument.

       •  The range of values that is passed via the typeflag argument supplied to fn() is smaller: just FTW_F, FTW_D, FTW_DNR, FTW_NS, and (possibly) FTW_SL.

RETURN VALUE
       These functions return 0 on success, and -1 if an error occurs.

       If fn() returns nonzero, then the tree walk is terminated and the value returned by fn() is returned as the result of ftw() or nftw().

       If nftw() is called with the FTW_ACTIONRETVAL flag, then the only nonzero value that should be used by fn() to terminate the tree walk is FTW_STOP, and that value is returned  as  the  result  of
       nftw().

VERSIONS
       In  some implementations (e.g., glibc), ftw() will never use FTW_SL; on other systems FTW_SL occurs only for symbolic links that do not point to an existing file; and again on other systems ftw()
       will use FTW_SL for each symbolic link.  If fpath is a symbolic link and stat(2) failed, POSIX.1-2008 states that it is undefined whether FTW_NS or FTW_SL is passed in typeflag.  For  predictable
       results, use nftw().

STANDARDS
       POSIX.1-2008.

HISTORY
       ftw()  POSIX.1-2001, SVr4, SUSv1.  POSIX.1-2008 marks it as obsolete.

       nftw() glibc 2.1.  POSIX.1-2001, SUSv1.

       FTW_SL POSIX.1-2001, SUSv1.

NOTES
       POSIX.1-2008 notes that the results are unspecified if fn does not preserve the current working directory.

BUGS
       According to POSIX.1-2008, when the typeflag argument passed to fn() contains FTW_SLN, the buffer pointed to by sb should contain information about the dangling symbolic link (obtained by calling
       lstat(2) on the link).  Early glibc versions correctly followed the POSIX specification on this point.  However, as a result of a regression introduced in glibc 2.4, the contents  of  the  buffer
       pointed  to by sb were undefined when FTW_SLN is passed in typeflag.  (More precisely, the contents of the buffer were left unchanged in this case.)  This regression was eventually fixed in glibc
       2.30, so that the glibc implementation (once more) follows the POSIX specification.

EXAMPLES
       The following program traverses the directory tree under the path named in its first command-line argument, or under the current directory if no argument is supplied.  It displays various  infor‐
       mation about each file.  The second command-line argument can be used to specify characters that control the value assigned to the flags argument when calling nftw().

NAME
       nftw — walk a file tree

SYNOPSIS
       #include <ftw.h>

       int nftw(const char *path, int (*fn)(const char *,
           const struct stat *, int, struct FTW *), int fd_limit, int flags);

DESCRIPTION
       The nftw() function shall recursively descend the directory hierarchy rooted in path.  The nftw() function has a similar effect to ftw() except that it takes an additional argument  flags,  which
       is a bitwise-inclusive OR of zero or more of the following flags:

       FTW_CHDIR   If set, nftw() shall change the current working directory to each directory as it reports files in that directory. If clear, nftw() shall not change the current working directory.

       FTW_DEPTH   If set, nftw() shall report all files in a directory before reporting the directory itself. If clear, nftw() shall report any directory before reporting the files in that directory.

       FTW_MOUNT   If set, nftw() shall only report files in the same file system as path.  If clear, nftw() shall report all files encountered during the walk.

       FTW_PHYS    If set, nftw() shall perform a physical walk and shall not follow symbolic links.

       If  FTW_PHYS  is clear and FTW_DEPTH is set, nftw() shall follow links instead of reporting them, but shall not report any directory that would be a descendant of itself. If FTW_PHYS is clear and
       FTW_DEPTH is clear, nftw() shall follow links instead of reporting them, but shall not report the contents of any directory that would be a descendant of itself.

       At each file it encounters, nftw() shall call the user-supplied function fn with four arguments:

        *  The first argument is the pathname of the object.

        *  The second argument is a pointer to the stat buffer containing information on the object, filled in as if fstatat(), stat(), or lstat() had been called to retrieve the information.

        *  The third argument is an integer giving additional information. Its value is one of the following:

           FTW_D     The object is a directory.

           FTW_DNR   The object is a directory that cannot be read. The fn function shall not be called for any of its descendants.

           FTW_DP    The object is a directory and subdirectories have been visited. (This condition shall only occur if the FTW_DEPTH flag is included in flags.)

           FTW_F     The object is a non-directory file.

           FTW_NS    The stat() function failed on the object because of lack of appropriate permission. The stat buffer passed to fn is undefined. Failure of stat() for any other reason  is  considered
                     an error and nftw() shall return -1.

           FTW_SL    The object is a symbolic link. (This condition shall only occur if the FTW_PHYS flag is included in flags.)

           FTW_SLN   The object is a symbolic link that does not name an existing file.  (This condition shall only occur if the FTW_PHYS flag is not included in flags.)

        *  The  fourth  argument is a pointer to an FTW structure.  The value of base is the offset of the object's filename in the pathname passed as the first argument to fn.  The value of level indi‐
           cates depth relative to the root of the walk, where the root level is 0.

       The results are unspecified if the application-supplied fn function does not preserve the current working directory.

       The argument fd_limit sets the maximum number of file descriptors that shall be used by nftw() while traversing the file tree. At most one file descriptor shall be used for each directory level.

       The nftw() function need not be thread-safe.

RETURN VALUE
       The nftw() function shall continue until the first of the following conditions occurs:

        *  An invocation of fn shall return a non-zero value, in which case nftw() shall return that value.

        *  The nftw() function detects an error other than [EACCES] (see FTW_DNR and FTW_NS above), in which case nftw() shall return -1 and set errno to indicate the error.

        *  The tree is exhausted, in which case nftw() shall return 0.

ERRORS
       The nftw() function shall fail if:

       EACCES Search permission is denied for any component of path or read permission is denied for path, or fn returns -1 and does not reset errno.

       ELOOP  A loop exists in symbolic links encountered during resolution of the path argument.

       ENAMETOOLONG
              The length of a component of a pathname is longer than {NAME_MAX}.

       ENOENT A component of path does not name an existing file or path is an empty string.

       ENOTDIR
              A component of path names an existing file that is neither a directory nor a symbolic link to a directory.

       EOVERFLOW
              A field in the stat structure cannot be represented correctly in the current programming environment for one or more files found in the file hierarchy.

       The nftw() function may fail if:

       ELOOP  More than {SYMLOOP_MAX} symbolic links were encountered during resolution of the path argument.

       EMFILE All file descriptors available to the process are currently open.

       ENAMETOOLONG
              The length of a pathname exceeds {PATH_MAX}, or pathname resolution of a symbolic link produced an intermediate result with a length that exceeds {PATH_MAX}.

       ENFILE Too many files are currently open in the system.

       In addition, errno may be set if the function pointed to by fn causes errno to be set.

       The following sections are informative.

       tion about each file. The second command-line argument can be used to specify characters that control the value assigned to the flags argument when calling nftw().

                   exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
               }

               exit(EXIT_SUCCESS);
           }

APPLICATION USAGE
       The nftw() function may allocate dynamic storage during its operation. If nftw() is forcibly terminated, such as by longjmp() or siglongjmp() being executed by the function pointed to by fn or an
       interrupt routine, nftw() does not have a chance to free that storage, so it remains permanently allocated. A safe way to handle interrupts is to store the fact that an  interrupt  has  occurred,
       and arrange to have the function pointed to by fn return a non-zero value at its next invocation.

RATIONALE
       None.

FUTURE DIRECTIONS
       None.
