NAME
       gnutls_x509_crl_get_issuer_dn2 - API function

SYNOPSIS
       #include <gnutls/x509.h>

       int gnutls_x509_crl_get_issuer_dn2(gnutls_x509_crl_t crl, gnutls_datum_t * dn);

ARGUMENTS
       gnutls_x509_crl_t crl
                   should contain a gnutls_x509_crl_t type

       gnutls_datum_t * dn
                   a pointer to a structure to hold the name; must be freed using gnutls_free()

DESCRIPTION
       This function will allocate buffer and copy the name of the CRL issuer.  The name will be in the form "C=xxxx,O=yyyy,CN=zzzz" as described in RFC4514. The output string will be ASCII or UTF-8 en‐
       coded, depending on the certificate data.

       This function does not output a fully RFC4514 compliant string, if that is required see gnutls_x509_crl_get_issuer_dn3().

RETURNS
       On success, GNUTLS_E_SUCCESS (0) is returned, otherwise a negative error value.
