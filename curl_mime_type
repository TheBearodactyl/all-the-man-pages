NAME
       curl_mime_type - set a mime part's content type

SYNOPSIS
       #include <curl/curl.h>

       CURLcode curl_mime_type(curl_mimepart *part, const char *mimetype);

DESCRIPTION
       curl_mime_type(3) sets a mime part's content type.

       part is the part's handle to assign the content type to.

       mimetype points to the null-terminated file mime type string; it may be set to NULL to remove a previously attached mime type.

       The  mime  type  string  is copied into the part, thus the associated storage may safely be released or reused after call. Setting a part's type multiple times is valid: only the value set by the
       last call is retained.

       In the absence of a mime type and if needed by the protocol specifications, a default mime type is determined by the context:
       - If set as a custom header, use this value.
       - application/form-data for an HTTP form post.
       - If a remote file name is set, the mime type is taken from the file name extension, or application/octet-stream by default.
       - For a multipart part, multipart/mixed.
       - text/plain in other cases.

EXAMPLE
        curl_mime *mime;
        curl_mimepart *part;

        /* create a mime handle */
        mime = curl_mime_init(easy);

        /* add a part */
        part = curl_mime_addpart(mime);

        /* get data from this file */
        curl_mime_filedata(part, "image.png");

        /* content-type for this part */
        curl_mime_type(part, "image/png");

        /* set name */
        curl_mime_name(part, "image");

AVAILABILITY
       As long as at least one of HTTP, SMTP or IMAP is enabled. Added in 7.56.0.

RETURN VALUE
       CURLE_OK or a CURL error code upon failure.
