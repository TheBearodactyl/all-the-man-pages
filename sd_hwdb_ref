SD_HWDB_NEW(3)                    sd_hwdb_new                   SD_HWDB_NEW(3)

NAME
       sd_hwdb_new, sd_hwdb_new_from_path, sd_hwdb_ref, sd_hwdb_unref - Create
       a new hwdb object and create or destroy references to it

SYNOPSIS
       #include <systemd/sd-hwdb.h>

       int sd_hwdb_new(sd_hwdb **hwdb);

       int sd_hwdb_new_from_path(const char *path, sd_hwdb **hwdb);

       sd_hwdb* sd_hwdb_ref(sd_hwdb *hwdb);

       sd_hwdb* sd_hwdb_unref(sd_hwdb *hwdb);

DESCRIPTION
       sd_hwdb_new() creates a new hwdb object to access the binary hwdb
       database. Upon initialization, the file containing the binary
       representation of the hardware database is located and opened. The new
       object is returned in hwdb.

       sd_hwdb_new_from_path() may be used to specify the path from which the
       binary hardware database should be opened.

       The hwdb object is reference counted.  sd_hwdb_ref() and
       sd_hwdb_unref() may be used to get a new reference or destroy an
       existing reference to an object. The caller must dispose of the
       reference acquired with sd_hwdb_new() by calling sd_hwdb_unref() when
       done with the object.

       Use sd_hwdb_seek(3), sd_hwdb_get(3), and sd_hwdb_enumerate(3) to access
       entries.

RETURN VALUE
       On success, sd_hwdb_new() and sd_hwdb_new_from_path() return a
       non-negative integer. On failure, a negative errno-style error code is
       returned.

       sd_hwdb_ref() always returns the argument.

       sd_hwdb_unref() always returns NULL.

   Errors
       Returned errors may indicate the following problems:

       -ENOENT
           The binary hardware database file could not be located. See
           systemd-hwdb(8) for more information.

       -EINVAL
           The located binary hardware database file is in an incompatible
           format.

       -ENOMEM
           Memory allocation failed.

NOTES
       These APIs are implemented as a shared library, which can be compiled
       and linked to with the libsystemd pkg-config(1) file.
