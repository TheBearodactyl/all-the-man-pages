NAME
       Test2::Event::Subtest - Event for subtest types

DESCRIPTION
       This class represents a subtest. This class is a subclass of Test2::Event::Ok.

ACCESSORS
       This class inherits from Test2::Event::Ok.

       $arrayref = $e->subevents
           Returns the arrayref containing all the events from the subtest

       $bool = $e->buffered
           True if the subtest is buffered, that is all subevents render at once. If this is false it means all subevents render as they are produced.
