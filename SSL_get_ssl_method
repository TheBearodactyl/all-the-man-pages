SSL_CTX_SET_SSL_VERSION(3ssl)       OpenSSL      SSL_CTX_SET_SSL_VERSION(3ssl)

NAME
       SSL_CTX_set_ssl_version, SSL_CTX_get_ssl_method, SSL_set_ssl_method,
       SSL_get_ssl_method - choose a new TLS/SSL method

SYNOPSIS
        #include <openssl/ssl.h>

        int SSL_CTX_set_ssl_version(SSL_CTX *ctx, const SSL_METHOD *method);
        const SSL_METHOD *SSL_CTX_get_ssl_method(const SSL_CTX *ctx);

        int SSL_set_ssl_method(SSL *s, const SSL_METHOD *method);
        const SSL_METHOD *SSL_get_ssl_method(const SSL *ssl);

DESCRIPTION
       SSL_CTX_set_ssl_version() sets a new default TLS/SSL method for SSL
       objects newly created from this ctx.  Most of the configuration
       attached to the SSL_CTX object is retained, with the exception of the
       configured TLS ciphers, which are reset to the default values.  SSL
       objects already created from this SSL_CTX with SSL_new(3) are not
       affected, except when SSL_clear(3) is being called, as described below.

       SSL_CTX_get_ssl_method() returns the SSL_METHOD which was used to
       construct the SSL_CTX.

       SSL_set_ssl_method() sets a new TLS/SSL method for a particular ssl
       object. It may be reset, when SSL_clear() is called.

       SSL_get_ssl_method() returns a pointer to the TLS/SSL method set in
       ssl.

NOTES
       The available method choices are described in SSL_CTX_new(3).

       When SSL_clear(3) is called and no session is connected to an SSL
       object, the method of the SSL object is reset to the method currently
       set in the corresponding SSL_CTX object.

       SSL_CTX_set_version() has unusual semantics and no clear use case; it
       would usually be preferable to create a new SSL_CTX object than to try
       to reuse an existing one in this fashion.  Its usage is considered
       deprecated.

RETURN VALUES
       The following return values can occur for SSL_CTX_set_ssl_version() and
       SSL_set_ssl_method():

       0   The new choice failed, check the error stack to find out the
           reason.

       1   The operation succeeded.

       SSL_CTX_get_ssl_method() and SSL_get_ssl_method() always return non-
       NULL pointers.
