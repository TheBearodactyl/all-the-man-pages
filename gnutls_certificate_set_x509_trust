NAME
       gnutls_certificate_set_x509_trust - API function

SYNOPSIS
       #include <gnutls/gnutls.h>

       int gnutls_certificate_set_x509_trust(gnutls_certificate_credentials_t res, gnutls_x509_crt_t * ca_list, int ca_list_size);

ARGUMENTS
       gnutls_certificate_credentials_t res
                   is a gnutls_certificate_credentials_t type.

       gnutls_x509_crt_t * ca_list
                   is a list of trusted CAs

       int ca_list_size
                   holds the size of the CA list

DESCRIPTION
       This  function  adds the trusted CAs in order to verify client or server certificates. In case of a client this is not required to be called if the certificates are not verified using gnutls_cer‐
       tificate_verify_peers2().  This function may be called multiple times.

       In case of a server the CAs set here will be sent to the client if a certificate request is sent. This can be disabled using gnutls_certificate_send_x509_rdn_sequence().

RETURNS
       the number of certificates processed or a negative error code on error.
