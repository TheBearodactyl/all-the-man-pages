NAME
       CURLOPT_UNRESTRICTED_AUTH - send credentials to other hosts too

SYNOPSIS
       #include <curl/curl.h>

       CURLcode curl_easy_setopt(CURL *handle, CURLOPT_UNRESTRICTED_AUTH,
                                 long goahead);

DESCRIPTION
       Set  the  long  gohead  parameter to 1L to make libcurl continue to send authentication (user+password) credentials when following locations, even when hostname changed. This option is meaningful
       only when setting CURLOPT_FOLLOWLOCATION(3).

       Further, when this option is not used or set to 0L, libcurl will not send custom set nor internally generated Authentication: headers on requests done to other hosts than the  one  used  for  the
       initial URL.

       By default, libcurl will only send credentials and Authentication headers to the initial host name as given in the original URL, to avoid leaking username + password to other sites.

       This  option  should  be used with caution: when curl follows redirects it blindly fetches the next URL as instructed by the server. Setting CURLOPT_UNRESTRICTED_AUTH(3) to 1L will therefore also
       make curl trust the server and send possibly sensitive credentials to a host the server points out.

DEFAULT
       0

PROTOCOLS
       HTTP

EXAMPLE
       CURL *curl = curl_easy_init();
       if(curl) {
         curl_easy_setopt(curl, CURLOPT_URL, "https://example.com");
         curl_easy_setopt(curl, CURLOPT_FOLLOWLOCATION, 1L);
         curl_easy_setopt(curl, CURLOPT_UNRESTRICTED_AUTH, 1L);
         curl_easy_perform(curl);
       }

AVAILABILITY
       Along with HTTP

RETURN VALUE
       Returns CURLE_OK if HTTP is supported, and CURLE_UNKNOWN_OPTION if not.
