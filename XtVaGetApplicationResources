NAME
       XtGetApplicationResources, XtVaGetApplicationResources - obtain application resources

SYNTAX
       #include <X11/Intrinsic.h>

       void XtGetApplicationResources(Widget w, XtPointer base, XtResourceList resources, Cardinal num_resources, ArgList args, Cardinal num_args);

       void XtVaGetApplicationResources(Widget w, XtPointer base, XtResourceList resources, Cardinal num_resources, ...);

ARGUMENTS
       args      Specifies the argument list to override resources obtained from the resource database.

       base      Specifies the base address of the subpart data structure where the resources should be written.

       num_args  Specifies the number of arguments in the argument list.

       num_resources
                 Specifies the number of resources in the resource list.

       resources Specifies the resource list for the subpart.

       w         Specifies the widget that wants resources for a subpart or that identifies the resource database to search.

       ...       Specifies the variable arguments to override resources obtained from the resource database.

DESCRIPTION
       The XtGetApplicationResources function first uses the passed widget, which is usually an application shell, to construct a resource name and class list, Then, it retrieves the resources from the
       argument list, the resource database, or the resource list default values.  After adding base to each address, XtGetApplicationResources copies the resources into the address given in the re‚Äê
       source list.  If args is NULL, num_args must be zero.  However, if num_args is zero, the argument list is not referenced.  The portable way to specify application resources is to declare them as
       members of a structure and pass the address of the structure as the base argument.
