Detailed Description
Function Documentation
   static hwloc_obj_t hwloc_get_first_largest_obj_inside_cpuset (hwloc_topology_t topology, hwloc_const_cpuset_t set) [inline],  [static]
       Get the first largest object included in the given cpuset set.

       Returns
           the first object that is included in set and whose parent is not.

       This is convenient for iterating over all largest objects within a CPU set by doing a loop getting the first largest object and clearing its CPU set from the remaining CPU set.

   int hwloc_get_largest_objs_inside_cpuset (hwloc_topology_t topology, hwloc_const_cpuset_t set, hwloc_obj_t *restrict objs, int max)
       Get the set of largest objects covering exactly a given cpuset set.

       Returns
           the number of objects returned in objs.

   static unsigned hwloc_get_nbobjs_inside_cpuset_by_depth (hwloc_topology_t topology, hwloc_const_cpuset_t set, int depth) [inline],  [static]
       Return the number of objects at depth depth included in CPU set set.

       Note
           Objects with empty CPU sets are ignored (otherwise they would be considered included in any given set).

           This function cannot work if objects at the given depth do not have CPU sets (I/O or Misc objects).

   static int hwloc_get_nbobjs_inside_cpuset_by_type (hwloc_topology_t topology, hwloc_const_cpuset_t set, hwloc_obj_type_t type) [inline],  [static]
       Return the number of objects of type type included in CPU set set. If no object for that type exists inside CPU set set, 0 is returned. If there are several levels with objects of that type
       inside CPU set set, -1 is returned.

       Note
           Objects with empty CPU sets are ignored (otherwise they would be considered included in any given set).

           This function cannot work if objects of the given type do not have CPU sets (I/O objects).

   static hwloc_obj_t hwloc_get_next_obj_inside_cpuset_by_depth (hwloc_topology_t topology, hwloc_const_cpuset_t set, int depth, hwloc_obj_t prev) [inline],  [static]
       Return the next object at depth depth included in CPU set set. If prev is NULL, return the first object at depth depth included in set. The next invokation should pass the previous return value
       in prev so as to obtain the next object in set.

       Note
           Objects with empty CPU sets are ignored (otherwise they would be considered included in any given set).

           This function cannot work if objects at the given depth do not have CPU sets (I/O or Misc objects).

   static hwloc_obj_t hwloc_get_next_obj_inside_cpuset_by_type (hwloc_topology_t topology, hwloc_const_cpuset_t set, hwloc_obj_type_t type, hwloc_obj_t prev) [inline],  [static]
       Return the next object of type type included in CPU set set. If there are multiple or no depth for given type, return NULL and let the caller fallback to
       hwloc_get_next_obj_inside_cpuset_by_depth().

       Note
           Objects with empty CPU sets are ignored (otherwise they would be considered included in any given set).

           This function cannot work if objects of the given type do not have CPU sets (I/O or Misc objects).

   static int hwloc_get_obj_index_inside_cpuset (hwloc_topology_t topology, hwloc_const_cpuset_t set, hwloc_obj_t obj) [inline],  [static]
       Return the logical index among the objects included in CPU set set. Consult all objects in the same level as obj and inside CPU set set in the logical order, and return the index of obj within
       them. If set covers the entire topology, this is the logical index of obj. Otherwise, this is similar to a logical index within the part of the topology defined by CPU set set.

       Note
           Objects with empty CPU sets are ignored (otherwise they would be considered included in any given set).

           This function cannot work if obj does not have CPU sets (I/O objects).

   static hwloc_obj_t hwloc_get_obj_inside_cpuset_by_depth (hwloc_topology_t topology, hwloc_const_cpuset_t set, int depth, unsigned idx) [inline],  [static]
       Return the (logically) idx -th object at depth depth included in CPU set set.

       Note
           Objects with empty CPU sets are ignored (otherwise they would be considered included in any given set).

           This function cannot work if objects at the given depth do not have CPU sets (I/O or Misc objects).

   static hwloc_obj_t hwloc_get_obj_inside_cpuset_by_type (hwloc_topology_t topology, hwloc_const_cpuset_t set, hwloc_obj_type_t type, unsigned idx) [inline],  [static]
       Return the idx -th object of type type included in CPU set set. If there are multiple or no depth for given type, return NULL and let the caller fallback to
       hwloc_get_obj_inside_cpuset_by_depth().

       Note
           Objects with empty CPU sets are ignored (otherwise they would be considered included in any given set).

           This function cannot work if objects of the given type do not have CPU sets (I/O or Misc objects).
