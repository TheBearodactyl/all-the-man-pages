NAME
       gnutls_global_set_mem_functions - API function

SYNOPSIS
       #include <gnutls/compat.h>

       void  gnutls_global_set_mem_functions(gnutls_alloc_function  alloc_func,  gnutls_alloc_function  secure_alloc_func, gnutls_is_secure_function is_secure_func, gnutls_realloc_function realloc_func,
       gnutls_free_function free_func);

ARGUMENTS
       gnutls_alloc_function alloc_func
                   it's the default memory allocation function. Like malloc().

       gnutls_alloc_function secure_alloc_func
                   This is the memory allocation function that will be used for sensitive data.

       gnutls_is_secure_function is_secure_func
                   a function that returns 0 if the memory given is not secure. May be NULL.

       gnutls_realloc_function realloc_func
                   A realloc function

       gnutls_free_function free_func
                   The function that frees allocated data. Must accept a NULL pointer.

DEPRECATED
       since 3.3.0 it is no longer possible to replace the internally used memory allocation functions

       This is the function where you set the memory allocation functions gnutls is going to use. By default the libc's allocation functions (malloc(), free()), are used by gnutls, to allocate both sen‐
       sitive and not sensitive data.  This function is provided to set the memory allocation functions to something other than the defaults

       This function must be called before gnutls_global_init() is called.  This function is not thread safe.
