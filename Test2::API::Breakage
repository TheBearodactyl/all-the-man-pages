NAME
       Test2::API::Breakage - What breaks at what version

DESCRIPTION
       This module provides lists of modules that are broken, or have been broken in the past, when upgrading Test::Builder to use Test2.

FUNCTIONS
       These can be imported, or called as methods on the class.

       %mod_ver = upgrade_suggested()
       %mod_ver = Test2::API::Breakage->upgrade_suggested()
           This returns key/value pairs. The key is the module name, the value is the version number. If the installed version of the module is at or below the specified one then an upgrade would be a
           good idea, but not strictly necessary.

       %mod_ver = upgrade_required()
       %mod_ver = Test2::API::Breakage->upgrade_required()
           This returns key/value pairs. The key is the module name, the value is the version number. If the installed version of the module is at or below the specified one then an upgrade is required
           for the module to work properly.

       %mod_ver = known_broken()
       %mod_ver = Test2::API::Breakage->known_broken()
           This returns key/value pairs. The key is the module name, the value is the version number. If the installed version of the module is at or below the specified one then the module will not
           work. A newer version may work, but is not tested or verified.
