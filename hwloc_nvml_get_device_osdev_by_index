NAME
       hwlocality_nvml - Interoperability with the NVIDIA Management Library

SYNOPSIS
   Functions
       static int hwloc_nvml_get_device_cpuset (hwloc_topology_t topology, nvmlDevice_t device, hwloc_cpuset_t set)
       static hwloc_obj_t hwloc_nvml_get_device_osdev_by_index (hwloc_topology_t topology, unsigned idx)
       static hwloc_obj_t hwloc_nvml_get_device_osdev (hwloc_topology_t topology, nvmlDevice_t device)

Detailed Description
       This interface offers ways to retrieve topology information about devices managed by the NVIDIA Management Library (NVML).

Function Documentation
   static int hwloc_nvml_get_device_cpuset (hwloc_topology_t topology, nvmlDevice_t device, hwloc_cpuset_t set) [inline],  [static]
       Get the CPU set of processors that are physically close to NVML device device. Store in set the CPU-set describing the locality of the NVML device device.

       Topology topology and device device must match the local machine. I/O devices detection and the NVML component are not needed in the topology.

       The function only returns the locality of the device. If more information about the device is needed, OS objects should be used instead, see hwloc_nvml_get_device_osdev() and
       hwloc_nvml_get_device_osdev_by_index().

       This function is currently only implemented in a meaningful way for Linux; other systems will simply get a full cpuset.

   static hwloc_obj_t hwloc_nvml_get_device_osdev (hwloc_topology_t topology, nvmlDevice_t device) [inline],  [static]
       Get the hwloc OS device object corresponding to NVML device device.

       Returns
           The hwloc OS device object that describes the given NVML device device.

           NULL if none could be found.

       Topology topology and device device must match the local machine. I/O devices detection and the NVML component must be enabled in the topology. If not, the locality of the object may still be
       found using hwloc_nvml_get_device_cpuset().

       Note
           The corresponding hwloc PCI device may be found by looking at the result parent pointer (unless PCI devices are filtered out).

   static hwloc_obj_t hwloc_nvml_get_device_osdev_by_index (hwloc_topology_t topology, unsigned idx) [inline],  [static]
       Get the hwloc OS device object corresponding to the NVML device whose index is idx.

       Returns
           The hwloc OS device object describing the NVML device whose index is idx.

           NULL if none could be found.

       The topology topology does not necessarily have to match the current machine. For instance the topology may be an XML import of a remote host. I/O devices detection and the NVML component must be
       enabled in the topology.

       Note
           The corresponding PCI device object can be obtained by looking at the OS device parent object (unless PCI devices are filtered out).
