PROLOG
       This  manual  page is part of the POSIX Programmer's Manual.  The Linux implementation of this interface may differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for details of Linux behavior), or
       the interface may not be implemented on Linux.

NAME
       vfwscanf, vswscanf, vwscanf — wide-character formatted input of a stdarg argument list

SYNOPSIS
       #include <stdarg.h>
       #include <stdio.h>
       #include <wchar.h>

       int vfwscanf(FILE *restrict stream, const wchar_t *restrict format,
           va_list arg);
       int vswscanf(const wchar_t *restrict ws, const wchar_t *restrict format,
           va_list arg);
       int vwscanf(const wchar_t *restrict format, va_list arg);

DESCRIPTION
       The functionality described on this reference page is aligned with the ISO C standard. Any conflict between the requirements described here and the ISO C standard is unintentional. This volume of
       POSIX.1‐2017 defers to the ISO C standard.

       The vfwscanf(), vswscanf(), and vwscanf() functions shall be equivalent to the fwscanf(), swscanf(), and wscanf() functions, respectively, except that instead of being called with a variable num‐
       ber of arguments, they are called with an argument list as defined in the <stdarg.h> header. These functions shall not invoke the va_end macro. As these functions invoke  the  va_arg  macro,  the
       value of ap after the return is unspecified.

RETURN VALUE
       Refer to fwscanf().

ERRORS
       Refer to fwscanf().

       The following sections are informative.

EXAMPLES
       None.

APPLICATION USAGE
       Applications using these functions should call va_end(ap) afterwards to clean up.

RATIONALE
       None.

FUTURE DIRECTIONS
       None.
