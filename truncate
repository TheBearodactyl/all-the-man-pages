NAME
       truncate - shrink or extend the size of a file to the specified size

SYNOPSIS
       truncate OPTION... FILE...

DESCRIPTION
       Shrink or extend the size of each FILE to the specified size

       A FILE argument that does not exist is created.

       If a FILE is larger than the specified size, the extra data is lost.  If a FILE is shorter, it is extended and the sparse extended part (hole) reads as zero bytes.

       Mandatory arguments to long options are mandatory for short options too.

       -c, --no-create
              do not create any files

       -o, --io-blocks
              treat SIZE as number of IO blocks instead of bytes

       -r, --reference=RFILE
              base size on RFILE

       -s, --size=SIZE
              set or adjust the file size by SIZE bytes

       --help display this help and exit

       --version
              output version information and exit

       The  SIZE  argument  is  an  integer and optional unit (example: 10K is 10*1024).  Units are K,M,G,T,P,E,Z,Y,R,Q (powers of 1024) or KB,MB,... (powers of 1000).  Binary prefixes can be used, too:
       KiB=K, MiB=M, and so on.

       SIZE may also be prefixed by one of the following modifying characters: '+' extend by, '-' reduce by, '<' at most, '>' at least, '/' round down to multiple of, '%' round up to multiple of.

PROLOG

NAME
       truncate — truncate a file to a specified length

SYNOPSIS
       #include <unistd.h>

       int truncate(const char *path, off_t length);

DESCRIPTION
       The truncate() function shall cause the regular file named by path to have a size which shall be equal to length bytes.

       If the file previously was larger than length, the extra data is discarded. If the file was previously shorter than length, its size is increased, and the extended area  appears  as  if  it  were
       zero-filled.

       The application shall ensure that the process has write permission for the file.

       If the request would cause the file size to exceed the soft file size limit for the process, the request shall fail and the implementation shall generate the SIGXFSZ signal for the process.

       The  truncate() function shall not modify the file offset for any open file descriptions associated with the file. Upon successful completion, truncate() shall mark for update the last data modi‐
       fication and last file status change timestamps of the file, and the S_ISUID and S_ISGID bits of the file mode may be cleared.

RETURN VALUE
       Upon successful completion, truncate() shall return 0. Otherwise, -1 shall be returned, and errno set to indicate the error.

ERRORS
       The truncate() function shall fail if:

       EINTR  A signal was caught during execution.

       EINVAL The length argument was less than 0.

       EFBIG or EINVAL
              The length argument was greater than the maximum file size.

       EIO    An I/O error occurred while reading from or writing to a file system.

       EACCES A component of the path prefix denies search permission, or write permission is denied on the file.

       EISDIR The named file is a directory.

       ELOOP  A loop exists in symbolic links encountered during resolution of the path argument.

       ENAMETOOLONG
              The length of a component of a pathname is longer than {NAME_MAX}.

       ENOENT A component of path does not name an existing file or path is an empty string.

       ENOTDIR
              A component of the path prefix names an existing file that is neither a directory nor a symbolic link to a directory, or the path argument contains at least one non-<slash>  character  and
              ends with one or more trailing <slash> characters and the last pathname component names an existing file that is neither a directory nor a symbolic link to a directory.

       EROFS  The named file resides on a read-only file system.

       The truncate() function may fail if:

       ELOOP  More than {SYMLOOP_MAX} symbolic links were encountered during resolution of the path argument.

       ENAMETOOLONG
              The length of a pathname exceeds {PATH_MAX}, or pathname resolution of a symbolic link produced an intermediate result with a length that exceeds {PATH_MAX}.

NAME
       truncate, ftruncate - truncate a file to a specified length

LIBRARY
       Standard C library (libc, -lc)

SYNOPSIS
       #include <unistd.h>

       int truncate(const char *path, off_t length);
       int ftruncate(int fd, off_t length);

   Feature Test Macro Requirements for glibc (see feature_test_macros(7)):

       truncate():
           _XOPEN_SOURCE >= 500
               || /* Since glibc 2.12: */ _POSIX_C_SOURCE >= 200809L
               || /* glibc <= 2.19: */ _BSD_SOURCE

       ftruncate():
           _XOPEN_SOURCE >= 500
               || /* Since glibc 2.3.5: */ _POSIX_C_SOURCE >= 200112L
               || /* glibc <= 2.19: */ _BSD_SOURCE

DESCRIPTION
       The truncate() and ftruncate() functions cause the regular file named by path or referenced by fd to be truncated to a size of precisely length bytes.

       If the file previously was larger than this size, the extra data is lost.  If the file previously was shorter, it is extended, and the extended part reads as null bytes ('\0').

       The file offset is not changed.

       If the size changed, then the st_ctime and st_mtime fields (respectively, time of last status change and time of last modification; see inode(7)) for the file are updated, and the set-user-ID and
       set-group-ID mode bits may be cleared.

       With ftruncate(), the file must be open for writing; with truncate(), the file must be writable.

RETURN VALUE
       On success, zero is returned.  On error, -1 is returned, and errno is set to indicate the error.

ERRORS
       For truncate():

       EACCES Search permission is denied for a component of the path prefix, or the named file is not writable by the user.  (See also path_resolution(7).)

       EFAULT The argument path points outside the process's allocated address space.

       EFBIG  The argument length is larger than the maximum file size. (XSI)

       EINTR  While blocked waiting to complete, the call was interrupted by a signal handler; see fcntl(2) and signal(7).

       EINVAL The argument length is negative or larger than the maximum file size.

       EIO    An I/O error occurred updating the inode.

       EISDIR The named file is a directory.

       ELOOP  Too many symbolic links were encountered in translating the pathname.

       ENAMETOOLONG
              A component of a pathname exceeded 255 characters, or an entire pathname exceeded 1023 characters.

       ENOENT The named file does not exist.

       ENOTDIR
              A component of the path prefix is not a directory.

       EPERM  The underlying filesystem does not support extending a file beyond its current size.

       EPERM  The operation was prevented by a file seal; see fcntl(2).

       EROFS  The named file resides on a read-only filesystem.

       ETXTBSY
              The file is an executable file that is being executed.

       For ftruncate() the same errors apply, but instead of things that can be wrong with path, we now have things that can be wrong with the file descriptor, fd:

       EBADF  fd is not a valid file descriptor.

       EBADF or EINVAL
              fd is not open for writing.

       EINVAL fd does not reference a regular file or a POSIX shared memory object.

       EINVAL or EBADF
              The file descriptor fd is not open for writing.  POSIX permits, and portable applications should handle, either error for this case.  (Linux produces EINVAL.)

VERSIONS
       The details in DESCRIPTION are for XSI-compliant systems.  For non-XSI-compliant systems, the POSIX standard allows two behaviors for ftruncate() when length exceeds the file  length  (note  that
       truncate()  is not specified at all in such an environment): either returning an error, or extending the file.  Like most UNIX implementations, Linux follows the XSI requirement when dealing with
       native filesystems.  However, some nonnative filesystems do not permit truncate() and ftruncate() to be used to extend a file beyond its current length: a notable example on Linux is VFAT.

       On some 32-bit architectures, the calling signature for these system calls differ, for the reasons described in syscall(2).

STANDARDS
       POSIX.1-2008.

HISTORY
       POSIX.1-2001, 4.4BSD, SVr4 (first appeared in 4.2BSD).

       The original Linux truncate() and ftruncate() system calls were not designed to handle large file offsets.  Consequently, Linux 2.4 added truncate64() and ftruncate64() system calls  that  handle
       large files.  However, these details can be ignored by applications using glibc, whose wrapper functions transparently employ the more recent system calls where they are available.

NOTES
       ftruncate() can also be used to set the size of a POSIX shared memory object; see shm_open(3).

BUGS
       A  header  file  bug  in glibc 2.12 meant that the minimum value of _POSIX_C_SOURCE required to expose the declaration of ftruncate() was 200809L instead of 200112L.  This has been fixed in later
       glibc versions.
