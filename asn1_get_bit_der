NAME
       asn1_get_bit_der - API function

SYNOPSIS
       #include <libtasn1.h>

       int asn1_get_bit_der(const unsigned char * der, int der_len, int * ret_len, unsigned char * str, int str_size, int * bit_len);

ARGUMENTS
       const unsigned char * der
                   DER data to decode containing the BIT SEQUENCE.

       int der_len Length of DER data to decode.

       int * ret_len
                   Output variable containing the length of the DER data.

       unsigned char * str
                   Pre-allocated output buffer to put decoded BIT SEQUENCE in.

       int str_size
                   Length of pre-allocated output buffer.

       int * bit_len
                   Output variable containing the size of the BIT SEQUENCE.

DESCRIPTION
       Extract a BIT SEQUENCE from DER data.

RETURNS
       ASN1_SUCCESS on success, or an error.
