NAME
       gnutls_ciphersuite_get - API function

SYNOPSIS
       #include <gnutls/gnutls.h>

       const char * gnutls_ciphersuite_get(gnutls_session_t session);

ARGUMENTS
       gnutls_session_t session
                   is a gnutls_session_t type.

DESCRIPTION
       Get the canonical name of negotiated TLS ciphersuite.  The names returned by this function match the IANA registry, with one exception:

       TLS_DHE_DSS_RC4_128_SHA { 0x00, 0x66 }

       which is reserved for compatibility.

       To get a detailed description of the current ciphersuite, it is recommended to use gnutls_session_get_desc().

RETURNS
       a string that contains the canonical name of a TLS ciphersuite, or NULL if the handshake is not completed.

SINCE
       3.7.4
