NAME
       xcb_destroy_window - Destroys a window

SYNOPSIS
       #include <xcb/xproto.h>

   Request function
       xcb_void_cookie_t xcb_destroy_window(xcb_connection_t *conn, xcb_window_t window);

REQUEST ARGUMENTS
       conn      The XCB connection to X11.

       window    The window to destroy.

DESCRIPTION
       Destroys the specified window and all of its subwindows. A DestroyNotify event is generated for each destroyed window (a DestroyNotify event is first generated for any given window's inferiors).
       If the window was mapped, it will be automatically unmapped before destroying.

       Calling DestroyWindow on the root window will do nothing.

RETURN VALUE
       Returns an xcb_void_cookie_t. Errors (if any) have to be handled in the event loop.

       If you want to handle errors directly with xcb_request_check instead, use xcb_destroy_window_checked. See xcb-requests(3) for details.

ERRORS
       xcb_window_error_t
                 The specified window does not exist.
