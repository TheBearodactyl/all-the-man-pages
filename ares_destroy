NAME
       ares_destroy - Destroy a resolver channel

SYNOPSIS
       #include <ares.h>

       void ares_destroy(ares_channel channel)

DESCRIPTION
       The ares_destroy(3) function destroys the name service channel identified by channel, freeing all memory and closing all sockets used by the channel.

       ares_destroy(3)  invokes the callbacks for each pending query on the channel, passing a status of ARES_EDESTRUCTION. These calls give the callbacks a chance to clean up any state which might have
       been stored in their arguments. A callback must not add new requests to a channel being destroyed.
