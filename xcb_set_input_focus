NAME
       xcb_set_input_focus - Sets input focus

SYNOPSIS
       #include <xcb/xproto.h>

   Request function
       xcb_void_cookie_t xcb_set_input_focus(xcb_connection_t *conn, uint8_t revert_to, xcb_window_t focus, xcb_timestamp_t time);

REQUEST ARGUMENTS
       conn      The XCB connection to X11.

       revert_to One of the following values:

                 XCB_INPUT_FOCUS_NONE
                           The focus reverts to XCB_NONE, so no window will have the input focus.

                 XCB_INPUT_FOCUS_POINTER_ROOT
                           The focus reverts to XCB_POINTER_ROOT respectively. When the focus reverts, FocusIn and FocusOut events are generated, but the last-focus-change time is not changed.

                 XCB_INPUT_FOCUS_PARENT
                           The focus reverts to the parent (or closest viewable ancestor) and the new revert_to value is XCB_INPUT_FOCUS_NONE.

                 XCB_INPUT_FOCUS_FOLLOW_KEYBOARD
                           NOT YET DOCUMENTED. Only relevant for the xinput extension.

                 Specifies what happens when the focus window becomes unviewable (if focus is neither XCB_NONE nor XCB_POINTER_ROOT).

       focus     The window to focus. All keyboard events will be reported to this window. The window must be viewable (TODO), or a xcb_match_error_t occurs (TODO).

                 If focus is XCB_NONE (TODO), all keyboard events are discarded until a new focus window is set.

                 If focus is XCB_POINTER_ROOT (TODO), focus is on the root window of the screen on which the pointer is on currently.

       time      Timestamp to avoid race conditions when running X over the network.

                 The special value XCB_CURRENT_TIME will be replaced with the current server time.

DESCRIPTION
       Changes the input focus and the last-focus-change time. If the specified time is earlier than the current last-focus-change time, the request is ignored (to avoid race conditions when running X
       over the network).

       A FocusIn and FocusOut event is generated when focus is changed.

RETURN VALUE
       Returns an xcb_void_cookie_t. Errors (if any) have to be handled in the event loop.

       If you want to handle errors directly with xcb_request_check instead, use xcb_set_input_focus_checked. See xcb-requests(3) for details.

ERRORS
       xcb_match_error_t
                 The specified focus window is not viewable.

       xcb_value_error_t
                 TODO: Reasons?

       xcb_window_error_t
                 The specified focus window does not exist.
