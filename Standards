NAME
       XStandards - X Window System Standards and Specifications

DESCRIPTION
       The  major  goal  of the X Consortium was to promote cooperation within
       the computer industry in the creation of standard  software  interfaces
       at  all  layers  in  the X Window System environment.  The X Consortium
       produced standards - documents which defined  network  protocols,  pro‐
       gramming  interfaces,  and  other  aspects of the X environment.  These
       standards continue to exist in  the  X.Org  Foundation  releases.   The
       X.Org  Foundation  also  produces specifications.  Like X Window System
       Standards, these are documents which define network protocols, program‐
       ming  interfaces,  and  other  aspects of the X environment.  Under the
       aegis of The Open Group, X Window System  standards,  X.Org  Foundation
       specifications,  and other specifications are the basis for portions of
       The Open Group's various CAE specifications.

       The status of various standards, specifications, and  the  software  in
       the X11R7.0 distribution, is explained below.

NON STANDARDS
       The X11R7.0 distribution contains sample implementations, not reference
       implementations.   Although much of the code is believed to be correct,
       the code should be assumed to be in error wherever  it  conflicts  with
       the specification.

       The only X Window System standards are the ones listed above.  No other
       documents, include files, or software in X11R7.0 carry  special  status
       within  the  X  Window  System.  For example, none of the following are
       standards: internal interfaces of the sample server; the MIT-SHM exten‐
       sion;  the Athena Widget Set; the Xmu library; the Xau library; the RGB
       database; the X Locale database; the fonts  distributed  with  X11R7.0;
       the  applications distributed with X11R7.0; the include files <X11/XWD‐
       File.h>,    <X11/Xfuncproto.h>,    <X11/Xfuncs.h>,     <X11/Xosdefs.h>,
       <X11/Xos.h>, <X11/Xos_r.h>, <X11/Xwinsock.h>, and <X11/Xthreads.h>; the
       bitmap files in <X11/bitmaps>.

       The Multi-Buffering extension was a draft standard of the X  Consortium
       but has been superseded by DBE as a standard.

X REGISTRY
       The  X.Org  Foundation maintains a registry of certain X-related items,
       to aid in avoiding conflicts and to aid in sharing of such items.

       The registry is published as part of the X Window System  software  re‐
       lease.  The latest version may also be found at
            ftp://ftp.x.org/pub/DOCS/registry
       The X Registry and the names in it are not X Window System standards.

NAME
       standards - C and UNIX Standards

DESCRIPTION
       The STANDARDS section that appears in many manual pages identifies var‐
       ious standards to which the documented interface conforms.  The follow‐
       ing list briefly describes these standards.

       V7     Version  7  (also  known  as  Seventh Edition) UNIX, released by
              AT&T/Bell Labs in 1979.  After this point, UNIX systems diverged
              into two main dialects: BSD and System V.

       4.2BSD This is an implementation standard defined by the 4.2 release of
              the Berkeley Software Distribution, released by  the  University
              of  California at Berkeley.  This was the first Berkeley release
              that contained a TCP/IP stack and the sockets API.   4.2BSD  was
              released in 1983.

              Earlier  major  BSD  releases included 3BSD (1980), 4BSD (1980),
              and 4.1BSD (1981).

       4.3BSD The successor to 4.2BSD, released in 1986.

       4.4BSD The successor to 4.3BSD, released in 1993.  This  was  the  last
              major Berkeley release.

       System V
              This  is  an implementation standard defined by AT&T's milestone
              1983 release of its commercial System  V  (five)  release.   The
              previous major AT&T release was System III, released in 1981.

       System V release 2 (SVr2)
              This  was the next System V release, made in 1985.  The SVr2 was
              formally described in the System V Interface Definition  version
              1 (SVID 1) published in 1985.

       System V release 3 (SVr3)
              This  was the successor to SVr2, released in 1986.  This release
              was formally described in the System V Interface Definition ver‐
              sion 2 (SVID 2).

       System V release 4 (SVr4)
              This  was the successor to SVr3, released in 1989.  This version
              of System V is described in the "Programmer's Reference  Manual:
              Operating  System  API  (Intel processors)" (Prentice-Hall 1992,
              ISBN 0-13-951294-2) This release was formally described  in  the
              System V Interface Definition version 3 (SVID 3), and is consid‐
              ered the definitive System V release.

       SVID 4 System V Interface Definition version 4, issued in 1995.  Avail‐
              able online at ⟨http://www.sco.com/developers/devspecs/⟩.

       C89    This was the first C language standard, ratified by ANSI (Ameri‐
              can National Standards Institute) in 1989 (X3.159-1989).   Some‐
              times  this  is  known  as ANSI C, but since C99 is also an ANSI
              standard, this term is ambiguous.  This standard was also  rati‐
              fied  by  ISO  (International  Standards  Organization)  in 1990
              (ISO/IEC 9899:1990), and is thus occasionally referred to as ISO
              C90.

       C99    This  revision of the C language standard was ratified by ISO in
              1999    (ISO/IEC    9899:1999).      Available     online     at
              ⟨http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg14/www/standards⟩.

       C11    This  revision of the C language standard was ratified by ISO in
              2011 (ISO/IEC 9899:2011).

       LFS    The Large File Summit specification, completed  in  1996.   This
              specification  defined mechanisms that allowed 32-bit systems to
              support the use of large files (i.e., 64-bit file offsets).  See
              ⟨https://www.opengroup.org/platform/lfs.html⟩.

       POSIX.1-1988
              This  was the first POSIX standard, ratified by IEEE as IEEE Std
              1003.1-1988, and subsequently adopted (with minor revisions)  as
              an ISO standard in 1990.  The term "POSIX" was coined by Richard
              Stallman.

       POSIX.1-1990
              "Portable Operating  System  Interface  for  Computing  Environ‐
              ments".   IEEE  1003.1-1990  part  1,  ratified  by  ISO in 1990
              (ISO/IEC 9945-1:1990).

       POSIX.2
              IEEE Std 1003.2-1992, describing commands and  utilities,  rati‐
              fied by ISO in 1993 (ISO/IEC 9945-2:1993).

       POSIX.1b (formerly known as POSIX.4)
              IEEE  Std 1003.1b-1993, describing real-time facilities for por‐
              table operating  systems,  ratified  by  ISO  in  1996  (ISO/IEC
              9945-1:1996).

       POSIX.1c (formerly known as POSIX.4a)
              IEEE  Std 1003.1c-1995, which describes the POSIX threads inter‐
              faces.

       POSIX.1d
              IEEE Std 1003.1d-1999, which describes additional real-time  ex‐
              tensions.

       POSIX.1g
              IEEE  Std 1003.1g-2000, which describes networking APIs (includ‐
              ing sockets).

       POSIX.1j
              IEEE Std 1003.1j-2000, which describes advanced real-time exten‐
              sions.

       POSIX.1-1996
              A  1996  revision  of  POSIX.1  which  incorporated POSIX.1b and
              POSIX.1c.

       XPG3   Released in 1989, this was  the  first  release  of  the  X/Open
              Portability   Guide   to   be   based   on   a   POSIX  standard
              (POSIX.1-1988).  This multivolume guide  was  developed  by  the
              X/Open Group, a multivendor consortium.

       XPG4   A  revision  of  the X/Open Portability Guide, released in 1992.
              This revision incorporated POSIX.2.

       XPG4v2 A 1994 revision of XPG4.  This is also referred to as Spec 1170,
              where  1170 referred to the number of interfaces defined by this
              standard.

       SUS (SUSv1)
              Single UNIX Specification.  This was a repackaging of XPG4v2 and
              other  X/Open standards (X/Open Curses Issue 4 version 2, X/Open
              Networking Service (XNS) Issue 4).  Systems conforming  to  this
              standard can be branded UNIX 95.

       SUSv2  Single UNIX Specification version 2.  Sometimes also referred to
              (incorrectly) as XPG5.  This standard appeared in 1997.  Systems
              conforming  to  this  standard can be branded UNIX 98.  See also
              ⟨http://www.unix.org/version2/⟩.)

       POSIX.1-2001, SUSv3
              This was a 2001  revision  and  consolidation  of  the  POSIX.1,
              POSIX.2, and SUS standards into a single document, conducted un‐
              der the auspices of the Austin  Group  ⟨http://www.opengroup.org
              /austin/⟩.     The    standard    is    available    online   at
              ⟨http://www.unix.org/version3/⟩.

              The standard defines two levels of  conformance:  POSIX  confor‐
              mance,  which is a baseline set of interfaces required of a con‐
              forming system; and XSI Conformance, which additionally mandates
              a  set  of  interfaces  (the "XSI extension") which are only op‐
              tional for POSIX conformance.   XSI-conformant  systems  can  be
              branded UNIX 03.

              The POSIX.1-2001 document is broken into four parts:

              XBD:  Definitions,  terms,  and concepts, header file specifica‐
              tions.

              XSH: Specifications of functions (i.e., system calls and library
              functions in actual implementations).

              XCU:  Specifications  of  commands and utilities (i.e., the area
              formerly described by POSIX.2).

              XRAT: Informative text on the other parts of the standard.

              POSIX.1-2001 is aligned with C99, so that  all  of  the  library
              functions   standardized   in   C99  are  also  standardized  in
              POSIX.1-2001.

              The Single UNIX Specification version 3  (SUSv3)  comprises  the
              Base Specifications containing XBD, XSH, XCU, and XRAT as above,
              plus X/Open Curses Issue 4 version 2 as an extra volume that  is
              not in POSIX.1-2001.

              Two  Technical  Corrigenda (minor fixes and improvements) of the
              original 2001 standard have occurred: TC1 in  2003  and  TC2  in
              2004.

       POSIX.1-2008, SUSv4
              Work on the next revision of POSIX.1/SUS was completed and rati‐
              fied  in  2008.    The   standard   is   available   online   at
              ⟨http://www.unix.org/version4/⟩.

              The  changes in this revision are not as large as those that oc‐
              curred for POSIX.1-2001/SUSv3, but a number  of  new  interfaces
              are  added  and  various  details of existing specifications are
              modified.   Many  of  the  interfaces  that  were  optional   in
              POSIX.1-2001  become mandatory in the 2008 revision of the stan‐
              dard.  A few interfaces that are  present  in  POSIX.1-2001  are
              marked as obsolete in POSIX.1-2008, or removed from the standard
              altogether.

              The revised standard is structured in the same way as its prede‐
              cessor.   The  Single  UNIX Specification version 4 (SUSv4) com‐
              prises the Base Specifications containing  XBD,  XSH,  XCU,  and
              XRAT,  plus X/Open Curses Issue 7 as an extra volume that is not
              in POSIX.1-2008.

              Again there are two levels of conformance:  the  baseline  POSIX
              Conformance,  and  XSI Conformance, which mandates an additional
              set of interfaces beyond those in the base specification.

              In general, where the STANDARDS section of a manual  page  lists
              POSIX.1-2001, it can be assumed that the interface also conforms
              to POSIX.1-2008, unless otherwise noted.

              Technical Corrigendum 1 (minor fixes and improvements)  of  this
              standard was released in 2013.

              Technical Corrigendum 2 of this standard was released in 2016.

       SUSv4 2016 edition
              This is equivalent to POSIX.1-2008, with the addition of Techni‐
              cal Corrigenda 1 and 2 and the XCurses specification.

       POSIX.1-2017
              This  revision of POSIX is technically identical to POSIX.1-2008
              with Technical Corrigenda 1 and 2 applied.

       SUSv4 2018 edition
              This is equivalent to POSIX.1-2017, with  the  addition  of  the
              XCurses specification.

       The  interfaces documented in POSIX.1/SUS are available as manual pages
       under sections 0p (header files), 1p (commands),  and  3p  (functions);
       thus one can write "man 3p open".
