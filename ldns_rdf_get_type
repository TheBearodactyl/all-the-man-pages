ldns(3)                                                                                  Library Functions Manual                                                                                  ldns(3)

NAME
       ldns_rdf_size, ldns_rdf_get_type, ldns_rdf_data, ldns_rdf_compare - get rdf attributes

SYNOPSIS
       #include <stdint.h>
       #include <stdbool.h>

       #include <ldns/ldns.h>

       size_t ldns_rdf_size(const ldns_rdf *rd);

       ldns_rdf_type ldns_rdf_get_type(const ldns_rdf *rd);

       uint8_t* ldns_rdf_data(const ldns_rdf *rd);

       int ldns_rdf_compare(const ldns_rdf *rd1, const ldns_rdf *rd2);

DESCRIPTION
       ldns_rdf_size() returns the size of the rdf.
              *rd: the rdf to read from
              Returns uint16_t with the size

       ldns_rdf_get_type() returns the type of the rdf. We need to insert _get_ here to prevent conflict the the rdf_type TYPE.
              *rd: the rdf to read from
              Returns ldns_rdf_type with the type

       ldns_rdf_data() returns the data of the rdf.
              *rd: the rdf to read from

              Returns uint8_t* pointer to the rdf's data

       ldns_rdf_compare() compares two rdf's on their wire formats.  (To order dnames according to rfc4034, use ldns_dname_compare)
              rd1: the first one
              rd2: the second one
              Returns 0 if equal
              Returns -1 if rd1 comes before rd2
              Returns +1 if rd2 comes before rd1
