PROLOG
       This  manual  page is part of the POSIX Programmer's Manual.  The Linux implementation of this interface may differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for details of Linux behavior), or
       the interface may not be implemented on Linux.

NAME
       type — write a description of command type

SYNOPSIS
       type name...

DESCRIPTION
       The type utility shall indicate how each argument would be interpreted if used as a command name.

OPTIONS
       None.

OPERANDS
       The following operand shall be supported:

       name      A name to be interpreted.

STDIN
       Not used.

INPUT FILES
       None.

ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
       The following environment variables shall affect the execution of type:

       LANG      Provide a default value for the internationalization variables that are unset or null. (See the Base Definitions volume of POSIX.1‐2017, Section 8.2, Internationalization Variables  for
                 the precedence of internationalization variables used to determine the values of locale categories.)

       LC_ALL    If set to a non-empty string value, override the values of all the other internationalization variables.

       LC_CTYPE  Determine the locale for the interpretation of sequences of bytes of text data as characters (for example, single-byte as opposed to multi-byte characters in arguments).

       LC_MESSAGES
                 Determine the locale that should be used to affect the format and contents of diagnostic messages written to standard error.

       NLSPATH   Determine the location of message catalogs for the processing of LC_MESSAGES.

       PATH      Determine the location of name, as described in the Base Definitions volume of POSIX.1‐2017, Chapter 8, Environment Variables.

ASYNCHRONOUS EVENTS
       Default.

STDOUT
       The  standard  output  of type contains information about each operand in an unspecified format. The information provided typically identifies the operand as a shell built-in, function, alias, or
       keyword, and where applicable, may display the operand's pathname.

STDERR
       The standard error shall be used only for diagnostic messages.

OUTPUT FILES
       None.

EXTENDED DESCRIPTION
       None.

EXIT STATUS
       The following exit values shall be returned:

        0    Successful completion.

       >0    An error occurred.

CONSEQUENCES OF ERRORS
       Default.

       The following sections are informative.

APPLICATION USAGE
       Since type must be aware of the contents of the current shell execution environment (such as the lists of commands, functions, and built-ins processed by hash), it is always provided as  a  shell
       regular built-in. If it is called in a separate utility execution environment, such as one of the following:

           nohup type writer
           find . -type f | xargs type

       it might not produce accurate results.

EXAMPLES
       None.

RATIONALE
       None.

FUTURE DIRECTIONS
       None.
