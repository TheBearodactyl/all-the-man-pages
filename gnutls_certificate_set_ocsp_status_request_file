NAME
       gnutls_certificate_set_ocsp_status_request_file - API function

SYNOPSIS
       #include <gnutls/gnutls.h>

       int gnutls_certificate_set_ocsp_status_request_file(gnutls_certificate_credentials_t       sc, const char * response_file, unsigned idx);

ARGUMENTS
       gnutls_certificate_credentials_t       sc
                   is a credentials structure.

       const char * response_file
                   a filename of the OCSP response

       unsigned idx
                   is a certificate index as returned by gnutls_certificate_set_key() and friends

DESCRIPTION
       This function loads the provided OCSP response. It will be sent to the client if requests an OCSP certificate status for the certificate chain specified by  idx .

NOTE
       the  ability  to  set  multiple  OCSP  responses  per  credential  structure  via  the  index   idx  was added in version 3.5.6. To keep backwards compatibility, it requires using gnutls_certifi‐
       cate_set_flags() with the GNUTLS_CERTIFICATE_API_V2 flag to make the set certificate functions return an index usable by this function.

       This function can be called multiple times since GnuTLS 3.6.3 when multiple responses which apply to the chain are available.  If the response provided does not match any certificates present  in
       the  chain,  the  code  GNUTLS_E_OCSP_MISMATCH_WITH_CERTS  is returned.  To revert to the previous behavior set the flag GNUTLS_CERTIFICATE_SKIP_OCSP_RESPONSE_CHECK in the certificate credentials
       structure. In that case, only the end-certificate's OCSP response can be set.  If the response is already expired at the time of loading the code GNUTLS_E_EXPIRED is returned.

       To revert to the previous behavior of this function which does not return any errors, set the flag GNUTLS_CERTIFICATE_SKIP_OCSP_RESPONSE_CHECK

RETURNS
       On success, GNUTLS_E_SUCCESS (0) is returned, otherwise a negative error code is returned.

SINCE
       3.1.3
