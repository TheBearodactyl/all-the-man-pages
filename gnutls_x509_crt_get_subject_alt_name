NAME
       gnutls_x509_crt_get_subject_alt_name - API function

SYNOPSIS
       #include <gnutls/x509.h>

       int gnutls_x509_crt_get_subject_alt_name(gnutls_x509_crt_t cert, unsigned int seq, void * san, size_t * san_size, unsigned int * critical);

ARGUMENTS
       gnutls_x509_crt_t cert
                   should contain a gnutls_x509_crt_t type

       unsigned int seq
                   specifies the sequence number of the alt name (0 for the first one, 1 for the second etc.)

       void * san  is the place where the alternative name will be copied to

       size_t * san_size
                   holds the size of san.

       unsigned int * critical
                   will be non-zero if the extension is marked as critical (may be null)

DESCRIPTION
       This function retrieves the Alternative Name (2.5.29.17), contained in the given certificate in the X509v3 Certificate Extensions.

       When  the SAN type is otherName, it will extract the data in the otherName's value field, and GNUTLS_SAN_OTHERNAME is returned.  You may use gnutls_x509_crt_get_subject_alt_othername_oid() to get
       the corresponding OID and the "virtual" SAN types (e.g., GNUTLS_SAN_OTHERNAME_XMPP).

       If an otherName OID is known, the data will be decoded.  Otherwise the returned data will be DER encoded, and you will have to decode it yourself.  Currently, only the RFC 3920 id-on-xmppAddr SAN
       is recognized.

RETURNS
       the  alternative  subject  name  type  on  success, one of the enumerated gnutls_x509_subject_alt_name_t.  It will return GNUTLS_E_SHORT_MEMORY_BUFFER if  san_size is not large enough to hold the
       value.  In that case  san_size will be updated with the  required  size.   If  the  certificate  does  not  have  an  Alternative  name  with  the  specified  sequence  number  then  GNUTLS_E_RE‐
       QUESTED_DATA_NOT_AVAILABLE is returned.
