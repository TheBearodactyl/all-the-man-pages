NAME
       xcb_create_pixmap - Creates a pixmap

SYNOPSIS
       #include <xcb/xproto.h>

   Request function
       xcb_void_cookie_t xcb_create_pixmap(xcb_connection_t *conn, uint8_t depth, xcb_pixmap_t pid, xcb_drawable_t drawable, uint16_t width, uint16_t height);

REQUEST ARGUMENTS
       conn      The XCB connection to X11.

       depth     TODO

       pid       The ID with which you will refer to the new pixmap, created by xcb_generate_id.

       drawable  Drawable to get the screen from.

       width     The width of the new pixmap.

       height    The height of the new pixmap.

DESCRIPTION
       Creates a pixmap. The pixmap can only be used on the same screen as drawable is on and only with drawables of the same depth.

RETURN VALUE
       Returns an xcb_void_cookie_t. Errors (if any) have to be handled in the event loop.

       If you want to handle errors directly with xcb_request_check instead, use xcb_create_pixmap_checked. See xcb-requests(3) for details.

ERRORS
       xcb_alloc_error_t
                 The X server could not allocate the requested resources (no memory?).

       xcb_drawable_error_t
                 The specified drawable (Window or Pixmap) does not exist.

       xcb_value_error_t
                 TODO: reasons?
