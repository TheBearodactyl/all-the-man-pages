NAME
       manpath - determine search path for manual pages

SYNOPSIS
       manpath [-qgdc?V] [-m system[,...]] [-C file]

DESCRIPTION
       If $MANPATH is set, manpath will simply display its contents and issue a warning.  If not, manpath will determine a suitable manual page hierarchy search path and display the results.

       The colon-delimited path is determined using information gained from the man-db configuration file – (/etc/man_db.conf) and the user's environment.

OPTIONS
       -q, --quiet
              Do not issue warnings.

       -d, --debug
              Print debugging information.

       -c, --catpath
              Produce a catpath as opposed to a manpath.  Once the manpath is determined, each path element is converted to its relative catpath.

       -g, --global
              Produce a manpath consisting of all paths named as "global" within the man-db configuration file.

       -m system[,...], --systems=system[,...]
              If  this system has access to other operating systems' manual hierarchies, this option can be used to include them in the output of manpath.  To include NewOS's manual page hierarchies use
              the option -m NewOS.

              The system specified can be a combination of comma delimited operating system names.  To include the native operating system's manual page hierarchies, the system name man must be included
              in the argument string.  This option will override the $SYSTEM environment variable.

       -C file, --config-file=file
              Use this user configuration file rather than the default of ~/.manpath.

       -?, --help
              Print a help message and exit.

       --usage
              Print a short usage message and exit.

       -V, --version
              Display version information.

ENVIRONMENT
       MANPATH
              If $MANPATH is set, manpath displays its value rather than determining it on the fly.

              See the SEARCH PATH section of manpath(5) for the default behaviour and details of how this environment variable is handled.

       SYSTEM If $SYSTEM is set, it will have the same effect as if it had been specified as the argument to the -m option.

FILES
       /etc/man_db.conf  man-db configuration file.

NAME
       manpath - format of the /etc/man_db.conf file

DESCRIPTION
       The manpath configuration file is used by the manual page utilities to assess users' manpaths at run time, to indicate which manual page hierarchies (manpaths) are to be treated as system hierar‐
       chies and to assign them directories to be used for storing cat files.

       If the environment variable $MANPATH is already set, the information contained within /etc/man_db.conf will not override it.

SEARCH PATH
       By default, man-db examines the user's $PATH.  For each path_element found there, it adds manpath_element to the search path.

       If there is no MANPATH_MAP line in the configuration file for a  given  path_element,  then  it  adds  all  of  path_element/../man,  path_element/man,  path_element/../share/man,  and  path_ele‐
       ment/share/man that exist as directories to the search path.

       It then adds any MANDATORY_MANPATH entries from the configuration file to the search path.

       Finally,  if the --systems option is used or the $SYSTEM environment variable is set, then that should consist of a sequence of operating system names separated by commas or colons.  This acts as
       a template, expanding the search path once more to allow access to other operating systems' manual pages: for each system name, man-db looks for that name as a subdirectory of each entry  in  the
       search  path, and adds it to the final search path if it exists.  A system name of man inserts the normal search path without subdirectories.  For example, if the search path would otherwise have
       been /usr/share/man:/usr/local/man, and $SYSTEM is set to newOS:man, then the final search path will be /usr/share/man/newOS:/usr/share/man:/usr/local/man/newOS:/usr/local/man.

       The $MANPATH environment variable overrides man-db's default manual page search paths.  Most users should not need to set it.  Its syntax is similar to the $PATH environment variable: it consists
       of a sequence of directory names separated by colons.  It overrides the default search path described above.

       If  the  value  of $MANPATH starts with a colon, then the default search path is added at its start.  If the value of $MANPATH ends with a colon, then the default search path is added at its end.
       If the value of $MANPATH contains a double colon (::), then the default search path is inserted in the middle of the value, between the two colons.

FORMAT
       The following field types are currently recognised:

       # comment
              Blank lines or those beginning with a # will be treated as comments and ignored.

       MANDATORY_MANPATH manpath_element
              Lines of this form indicate manpaths that every automatically generated $MANPATH should contain.  This will typically include /usr/man.

       MANPATH_MAP path_element manpath_element
              Lines of this form set up $PATH to $MANPATH mappings.  For each path_element found in the user's $PATH, manpath_element will be added to the $MANPATH.

       MANDB_MAP manpath_element [ catpath_element ]
              Lines of this form indicate which manpaths are to be treated as system manpaths, and optionally where their cat files should be stored.  This field type is particularly important if man is
              a  setuid  program, as (when in the system configuration file /etc/man_db.conf rather than the per-user configuration file .manpath) it indicates which manual page hierarchies to access as
              the setuid user and which as the invoking user.

              The system manual page hierarchies are usually those stored under /usr such as /usr/man, /usr/local/man and /usr/X11R6/man.

              If cat pages from a particular manpath_element are not to be stored or are to be stored in the traditional location, catpath_element may be omitted.

              Traditional cat placement would be impossible for read only mounted manual page hierarchies and because of this it is possible to specify any valid directory hierarchy for  their  storage.
              To observe the Linux FSSTND the keyword FSSTND can be used in place of an actual directory.

              Unfortunately, it is necessary to specify all system man tree paths, including alternate operating system paths such as /usr/man/sun and any NLS locale paths such as /usr/man/de_DE.88591.

              As  the  information  is  parsed  line by line in the order written, it is necessary for any manpath that is a sub-hierarchy of another hierarchy to be listed first, otherwise an incorrect
              match will be made.  An example is that /usr/man/de_DE.88591 must come before /usr/man.

       DEFINE key value
              Lines of this form define miscellaneous configuration variables; see the default configuration file for those variables used by the manual pager utilities.  They include default  paths  to
              various programs (such as grep and tbl), and default sets of arguments to those programs.

       SECTION section ...
              Lines of this form define the order in which manual sections should be searched.  If there are no SECTION directives in the configuration file, the default is:

                     SECTION 1 n l 8 3 0 2 3type 5 4 9 6 7

              If multiple SECTION directives are given, their section lists will be concatenated.

              If  a  particular extension is not in this list (say, 1mh) it will be displayed with the rest of the section it belongs to.  The effect of this is that you only need to explicitly list ex‐
              tensions if you want to force a particular order.  Sections with extensions should usually be adjacent to their main section (e.g. "1 1mh 8 ...").

              SECTIONS is accepted as an alternative name for this directive.

       MINCATWIDTH width
              If the terminal width is less than width, cat pages will not be created (if missing) or displayed.  The default is 80.

       MAXCATWIDTH width
              If the terminal width is greater than width, cat pages will not be created (if missing) or displayed.  The default is 80.

       CATWIDTH width
              If width is non-zero, cat pages will always be formatted for a terminal of the given width, regardless of the width of the terminal actually being used.   This  overrides  MINCATWIDTH  and
              MAXCATWIDTH.

       NOCACHE
              This flag prevents man(1) from creating cat pages automatically.

BUGS
       Unless the rules above are followed and observed precisely, the manual pager utilities will not function as desired.  The rules are overly complicated.
