BIO_SOCKET_WAIT(3ssl)               OpenSSL              BIO_SOCKET_WAIT(3ssl)

NAME
       BIO_socket_wait, BIO_wait, BIO_do_connect_retry - BIO connection
       utility functions

SYNOPSIS
        #include <openssl/bio.h>

        #ifndef OPENSSL_NO_SOCK
        int BIO_socket_wait(int fd, int for_read, time_t max_time);
        #endif
        int BIO_wait(BIO *bio, time_t max_time, unsigned int nap_milliseconds);
        int BIO_do_connect_retry(BIO *bio, int timeout, int nap_milliseconds);

DESCRIPTION
       BIO_socket_wait() waits on the socket fd for reading if for_read is not
       0, else for writing, at most until max_time.  It succeeds immediately
       if max_time == 0 (which means no timeout given).

       BIO_wait() waits at most until max_time on the given (typically socket-
       based) bio, for reading if bio is supposed to read, else for writing.
       It is used by BIO_do_connect_retry() and can be used together
       BIO_read(3).  It succeeds immediately if max_time == 0 (which means no
       timeout given).  If sockets are not available it supports polling by
       succeeding after sleeping at most the given nap_milliseconds in order
       to avoid a tight busy loop.  Via nap_milliseconds the caller determines
       the polling granularity.

       BIO_do_connect_retry() connects via the given bio.  It retries
       BIO_do_connect() as far as needed to reach a definite outcome, i.e.,
       connection succeeded, timeout has been reached, or an error occurred.
       For nonblocking and potentially even non-socket BIOs it polls every
       nap_milliseconds and sleeps in between using BIO_wait().  If
       nap_milliseconds is < 0 then a default value of 100 ms is used.  If the
       timeout parameter is > 0 this indicates the maximum number of seconds
       to wait until the connection is established or a definite error
       occurred.  A value of 0 enables waiting indefinitely (i.e, no timeout),
       while a value < 0 means that BIO_do_connect() is tried only once.  The
       function may, directly or indirectly, invoke ERR_clear_error().

RETURN VALUES
       BIO_socket_wait(), BIO_wait(), and BIO_do_connect_retry() return -1 on
       error, 0 on timeout, and 1 on success.
