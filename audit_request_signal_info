NAME
       audit_request_signal_info - Request signal info for the audit system

SYNOPSIS
       #include <libaudit.h>

       int audit_request_signal_info(int fd);

DESCRIPTION
       audit_request_signal_info requests that the kernel send information about the sender of a signal to the audit daemon. The signal info structure is as follows:

       struct audit_sig_info {
               uid_t           uid;
               pid_t           pid;
               char            ctx[0];
       };

       This function is likely to be used only by audit daemons and shouldn't be called by any other kind of program.

RETURN VALUE
       The return value is <= 0 on error, otherwise it is the netlink sequence id number. This function can have any error that sendto would encounter.

SEE ALSO
       audit_open(3), audit_get_reply(3).
