NAME
       gnutls_anti_replay_set_window - API function

SYNOPSIS
       #include <gnutls/gnutls.h>

       void gnutls_anti_replay_set_window(gnutls_anti_replay_t anti_replay, unsigned int window);

ARGUMENTS
       gnutls_anti_replay_t anti_replay
                   is a gnutls_anti_replay_t type.

       unsigned int window
                   is the time window recording ClientHello, in milliseconds

DESCRIPTION
       Sets the time window used for ClientHello recording.  In order to protect against replay attacks, the server records ClientHello messages within this time period from the last update, and consid‐
       ers it a replay when a ClientHello outside of the period; if a ClientHello arrives within this period, the server checks the database and detects duplicates.

       For the details of the algorithm, see RFC 8446, section 8.2.
