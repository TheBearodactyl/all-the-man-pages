NAME
       audit_set_failure - Set audit failure flag

SYNOPSIS
       #include <libaudit.h>

       int audit_set_failure(int fd, uint32_t failure);

DESCRIPTION
       audit_set_failure sets the action that the kernel will perform when the backlog limit is reached or when it encounters an error and cannot proceed. Possible values are:

       0 - AUDIT_FAIL_SILENT
              Do nothing, report nothing, skip logging the record and continue.

       1 - AUDIT_FAIL_PRINTK [default]
              Log the audit record using printk which will cause subsequent events to get written to syslog.

       2 - AUDIT_FAIL_PANIC
              Call the panic function. This would be used to prevent use of the machine upon loss of audit events.

RETURN VALUE
       The return value is <= 0 on error, otherwise it is the netlink sequence id number. This function can have any error that sendto would encounter.
