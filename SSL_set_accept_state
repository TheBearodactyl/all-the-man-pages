SSL_SET_CONNECT_STATE(3ssl)         OpenSSL        SSL_SET_CONNECT_STATE(3ssl)

NAME
       SSL_set_connect_state, SSL_set_accept_state, SSL_is_server - functions
       for manipulating and examining the client or server mode of an SSL
       object

SYNOPSIS
        #include <openssl/ssl.h>

        void SSL_set_connect_state(SSL *ssl);

        void SSL_set_accept_state(SSL *ssl);

        int SSL_is_server(const SSL *ssl);

DESCRIPTION
       SSL_set_connect_state() sets ssl to work in client mode.

       SSL_set_accept_state() sets ssl to work in server mode.

       SSL_is_server() checks if ssl is working in server mode.

NOTES
       When the SSL_CTX object was created with SSL_CTX_new(3), it was either
       assigned a dedicated client method, a dedicated server method, or a
       generic method, that can be used for both client and server
       connections. (The method might have been changed with
       SSL_CTX_set_ssl_version(3) or SSL_set_ssl_method(3).)

       When beginning a new handshake, the SSL engine must know whether it
       must call the connect (client) or accept (server) routines. Even though
       it may be clear from the method chosen, whether client or server mode
       was requested, the handshake routines must be explicitly set.

       When using the SSL_connect(3) or SSL_accept(3) routines, the correct
       handshake routines are automatically set. When performing a transparent
       negotiation using SSL_write_ex(3), SSL_write(3), SSL_read_ex(3), or
       SSL_read(3), the handshake routines must be explicitly set in advance
       using either SSL_set_connect_state() or SSL_set_accept_state().

       If SSL_is_server() is called before SSL_set_connect_state() or
       SSL_set_accept_state() is called (either automatically or explicitly),
       the result depends on what method was used when SSL_CTX was created
       with SSL_CTX_new(3). If a generic method or a dedicated server method
       was passed to SSL_CTX_new(3), SSL_is_server() returns 1; otherwise, it
       returns 0.

RETURN VALUES
       SSL_set_connect_state() and SSL_set_accept_state() do not return
       diagnostic information.

       SSL_is_server() returns 1 if ssl is working in server mode or 0 for
       client mode.
