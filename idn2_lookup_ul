NAME
       idn2_lookup_ul - API function

SYNOPSIS
       #include <idn2.h>

       int idn2_lookup_ul(const char * src, char ** lookupname, int flags);

ARGUMENTS
       const char * src
                   input zero-terminated locale encoded string.

       char ** lookupname
                   newly allocated output variable with name to lookup in DNS.

       int flags   optional idn2_flags to modify behaviour.

DESCRIPTION
       Perform  IDNA2008  lookup  string  conversion on domain name  src , as described in section 5 of RFC 5891.  Note that the input is assumed to be encoded in the locale's default coding system, and
       will be transcoded to UTF-8 and NFC normalized by this function.

       Pass IDN2_ALABEL_ROUNDTRIP in  flags to convert any input A-labels to U-labels and perform additional testing. This is default since version 2.2.  To switch this behavior off,  pass  IDN2_NO_ALA‐
       BEL_ROUNDTRIP

       Pass IDN2_TRANSITIONAL to enable Unicode TR46 transitional processing, and IDN2_NONTRANSITIONAL to enable Unicode TR46 non-transitional processing.

       Multiple flags may be specified by binary or:ing them together, for example IDN2_ALABEL_ROUNDTRIP | IDN2_NONTRANSITIONAL.

       The IDN2_NFC_INPUT in  flags is always enabled in this function.

       After version 0.11:  lookupname may be NULL to test lookup of  src without allocating memory.

RETURNS
       On  successful  conversion  IDN2_OK  is  returned,  if  conversion  from  locale  to  UTF-8  fails  then  IDN2_ICONV_FAIL  is  returned, if the output domain or any label would have been too long
       IDN2_TOO_BIG_DOMAIN or IDN2_TOO_BIG_LABEL is returned, or another error code is returned.

SINCE
       0.1
