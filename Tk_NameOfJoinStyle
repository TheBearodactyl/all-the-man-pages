NAME
       Tk_GetJoinStyle, Tk_NameOfJoinStyle - translate between strings and join styles

SYNOPSIS
       #include <tk.h>

       int
       Tk_GetJoinStyle(interp, string, joinPtr)

       const char *
       Tk_NameOfJoinStyle(join)

ARGUMENTS
       Tcl_Interp *interp (in)           Interpreter to use for error reporting.

       const char *string (in)           String containing name of join style - one of “bevel”, “miter”, or “round” - or a unique abbreviation of one.

       int *joinPtr (out)                Pointer to location in which to store X join style corresponding to string.

       int join (in)                     Join style: one of JoinBevel, JoinMiter, JoinRound.

DESCRIPTION
       Tk_GetJoinStyle places in *joinPtr the X join style corresponding to string, which will be one of JoinBevel, JoinMiter, or JoinRound.  Join styles are typically used in X graphics contexts to in‐
       dicate how adjacent line segments should be joined together.  See the X documentation for information on what each style implies.

       Under normal circumstances the return value is TCL_OK and interp is unused.  If string does not contain a valid join style or an abbreviation of one of these  names,  then  an  error  message  is
       stored in interpreter interp's result, TCL_ERROR is returned, and *joinPtr is unmodified.

       Tk_NameOfJoinStyle  is  the  logical inverse of Tk_GetJoinStyle.  Given a join style such as JoinBevel it returns a statically-allocated string corresponding to join.  If join is not a legal join
       style, then “unknown join style” is returned.
