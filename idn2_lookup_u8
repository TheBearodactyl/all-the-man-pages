NAME
       idn2_lookup_u8 - API function

SYNOPSIS
       #include <idn2.h>

       int idn2_lookup_u8(const uint8_t * src, uint8_t ** lookupname, int flags);

ARGUMENTS
       const uint8_t * src
                   input zero-terminated UTF-8 string in Unicode NFC normalized form.

       uint8_t ** lookupname
                   newly allocated output variable with name to lookup in DNS.

       int flags   optional idn2_flags to modify behaviour.

DESCRIPTION
       Perform IDNA2008 lookup string conversion on domain name  src , as described in section 5 of RFC 5891.  Note that the input string must be encoded in UTF-8 and be in Unicode NFC form.

       Pass IDN2_NFC_INPUT in  flags to convert input to NFC form before further processing.  IDN2_TRANSITIONAL and IDN2_NONTRANSITIONAL do already imply IDN2_NFC_INPUT.

       Pass  IDN2_ALABEL_ROUNDTRIP  in  flags to convert any input A-labels to U-labels and perform additional testing. This is default since version 2.2.  To switch this behavior off, pass IDN2_NO_ALA‐
       BEL_ROUNDTRIP

       Pass IDN2_TRANSITIONAL to enable Unicode TR46 transitional processing, and IDN2_NONTRANSITIONAL to enable Unicode TR46 non-transitional processing.

       Multiple flags may be specified by binary or:ing them together.

       After version 2.0.3: IDN2_USE_STD3_ASCII_RULES disabled by default.  Previously we were eliminating non-STD3 characters from domain strings such as _443._tcp.example.com, or IPs  1.2.3.4/24  pro‐
       vided to libidn2 functions. That was an unexpected regression for applications switching from libidn and thus it is no longer applied by default.  Use IDN2_USE_STD3_ASCII_RULES to enable that be‐
       havior again.

       After version 0.11:  lookupname may be NULL to test lookup of  src without allocating memory.

RETURNS
       On successful conversion IDN2_OK is returned, if the output domain or any label would have been too long IDN2_TOO_BIG_DOMAIN or IDN2_TOO_BIG_LABEL is returned, or another error code is returned.

SINCE
       0.1
