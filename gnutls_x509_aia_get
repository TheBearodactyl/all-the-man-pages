NAME
       gnutls_x509_aia_get - API function

SYNOPSIS
       #include <gnutls/x509-ext.h>

       int gnutls_x509_aia_get(gnutls_x509_aia_t aia, unsigned int seq, gnutls_datum_t * oid, unsigned * san_type, gnutls_datum_t * san);

ARGUMENTS
       gnutls_x509_aia_t aia
                   The authority info access

       unsigned int seq
                   specifies the sequence number of the access descriptor (0 for the first one, 1 for the second etc.)

       gnutls_datum_t * oid
                   the type of available data; to be treated as constant.

       unsigned * san_type
                   Will hold the type of the name of gnutls_subject_alt_names_t (may be null).

       gnutls_datum_t * san
                   the access location name; to be treated as constant (may be null).

DESCRIPTION
       This function reads from the Authority Information Access type.

       The   seq  input  parameter  is  used  to  indicate which member of the sequence the caller is interested in.  The first member is 0, the second member 1 and so on.  When the  seq value is out of
       bounds, GNUTLS_E_REQUESTED_DATA_NOT_AVAILABLE is returned.

       Typically  oid is GNUTLS_OID_AD_CAISSUERS or GNUTLS_OID_AD_OCSP.

RETURNS
       On success, GNUTLS_E_SUCCESS (0) is returned, otherwise a negative error value.

SINCE
       3.3.0
