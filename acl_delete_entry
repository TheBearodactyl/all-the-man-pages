NAME
     acl_delete_entry — delete an ACL entry

LIBRARY
     Linux Access Control Lists library (libacl, -lacl).

SYNOPSIS
     #include <sys/types.h>
     #include <sys/acl.h>

     int
     acl_delete_entry(acl_t acl, acl_entry_t entry_d);

DESCRIPTION
     The acl_delete_entry() function removes the ACL entry indicated by the entry_d descriptor from the ACL pointed to by acl.  Any existing ACL entry descriptors that refer to entries in acl other than
     that referred to by entry_d continue to refer to the same entries. The argument entry_d and any other ACL entry descriptors that refer to the same ACL entry are undefined after this function com‐
     pletes. Any existing ACL pointers that refer to the ACL referred to by acl continue to refer to the ACL.

RETURN VALUE
     The acl_delete_entry() function returns the value 0 if successful; otherwise the value -1 is returned and the global variable errno is set to indicate the error.

ERRORS
     If any of the following conditions occur, the acl_delete_entry() function returns -1 and sets errno to the corresponding value:

     [EINVAL]           The argument acl_p is not a valid pointer to an ACL.

                        The argument entry_d is not a valid pointer to an ACL entry.

STANDARDS
     IEEE Std 1003.1e draft 17 (“POSIX.1e”, abandoned)
