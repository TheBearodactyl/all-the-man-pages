NAME
       TIFFFlush - flush pending writes to an open TIFF file

SYNOPSIS
          #include <tiffio.h>

       int TIFFFlush(TIFF *tif)

       int TIFFFlushData(TIFF *tif)

DESCRIPTION
       TIFFFlush()  causes any pending writes for the specified file (including writes for the current directory) to be done. In normal operation this call is never needed—the library automatically does
       any flushing required.

       TIFFFlushData() flushes any pending image data for the specified file to be written out; directory-related data are not flushed. In normal operation this call is never needed—the library automat‐
       ically does any flushing required.

RETURN VALUES
       0 is returned if an error is encountered, otherwise 1 is returned.

DIAGNOSTICS
       All error messages are directed to the TIFFErrorExtR() routine.
