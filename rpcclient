DESCRIPTION
       This tool is part of the samba(7) suite.

       rpcclient is a utility initially developed to test MS-RPC functionality
       in Samba itself. It has undergone several stages of development and
       stability. Many system administrators have now written scripts around
       it to manage Windows NT clients from their UNIX workstation.

OPTIONS
       BINDING-STRING|HOST
           When connecting to a dcerpc service you need to specify a binding
           string.

           The format is:

           TRANSPORT:host[options]

           where TRANSPORT is either ncacn_np (named pipes) for SMB or
           ncacn_ip_tcp for DCERPC over TCP/IP.

           "host" is an IP or hostname or netbios name. If the binding string
           identifies the server side of an endpoint, "host" may be an empty
           string. See below for more details.

           "options" can include a SMB pipe name if using the ncacn_np
           transport or a TCP port number if using the ncacn_ip_tcp transport,
           otherwise they will be auto-determined.

           Examples:

                  •   ncacn_ip_tcp:samba.example.com[1024]

                  •   ncacn_ip_tcp:samba.example.com[sign,seal,krb5]

                  •   ncacn_ip_tcp:samba.example.com[sign,spnego]

                  •   ncacn_np:samba.example.com

                  •   ncacn_np:samba.example.com[samr]

                  •   ncacn_np:samba.example.com[samr,sign,print]

                  •   ncalrpc:/path/to/unix/socket

                  •   //SAMBA

           The supported transports are:

                  •   ncacn_np - Connect using named pipes

                  •   ncacn_ip_tcp - Connect over TCP/IP

                  •   ncalrpc - Connect over local RPC (unix sockets)

           The supported options are:

                  •   sign - Use RPC integrity authentication level

                  •   seal - Enable RPC privacy (encryption) authentication
                      level

                  •   connect - Use RPC connect level authentication (auth,
                      but no sign or seal)

                  •   packet - Use RPC packet authentication level

                  •   spnego - Use SPNEGO instead of NTLMSSP authentication

                  •   ntlm - Use plain NTLM instead of SPNEGO or NTLMSSP

                  •   krb5 - Use Kerberos instead of NTLMSSP authentication

                  •   schannel - Create a schannel connection

                  •   smb1 - Use SMB1 for named pipes

                  •   smb2 - Use SMB2/3 for named pipes

                  •   validate - Enable the NDR validator

                  •   print - Enable debug output of packets

                  •   padcheck - Check reply data for non-zero pad bytes

                  •   bigendian - Use big endian for RPC

                  •   ndr64 - Use NDR64 for RPC

       -c|--command=<command string>
           Execute semicolon separated commands (listed below)

       -I|--dest-ip IP-address
           IP address is the address of the server to connect to. It should be
           specified in standard "a.b.c.d" notation.

           Normally the client would attempt to locate a named SMB/CIFS server
           by looking it up via the NetBIOS name resolution mechanism
           described above in the name resolve order parameter above. Using
           this parameter will force the client to assume that the server is
           on the machine with the specified IP address and the NetBIOS name
           component of the resource being connected to will be ignored.

           There is no default for this parameter. If not supplied, it will be
           determined automatically by the client as described above.

       -p|--port port
           This number is the TCP port number that will be used when making
           connections to the server. The standard (well-known) TCP port
           number for an SMB/CIFS server is 139, which is the default.

       -?|--help
           Print a summary of command line options.

       --usage
           Display brief usage message.

       -d|--debuglevel=DEBUGLEVEL
           level is an integer from 0 to 10. The default value if this
           parameter is not specified is 1 for client applications.

           The higher this value, the more detail will be logged to the log
           files about the activities of the server. At level 0, only critical
           errors and serious warnings will be logged. Level 1 is a reasonable
           level for day-to-day running - it generates a small amount of
           information about operations carried out.

           Levels above 1 will generate considerable amounts of log data, and
           should only be used when investigating a problem. Levels above 3
           are designed for use only by developers and generate HUGE amounts
           of log data, most of which is extremely cryptic.

           Note that specifying this parameter here will override the log
           level parameter in the /etc/samba/smb.conf file.

       --debug-stdout
           This will redirect debug output to STDOUT. By default all clients
           are logging to STDERR.

       --configfile=<configuration file>
           The file specified contains the configuration details required by
           the client. The information in this file can be general for client
           and server or only provide client specific like options such as
           client smb encrypt. See /etc/samba/smb.conf for more information.
           The default configuration file name is determined at compile time.

       --option=<name>=<value>
           Set the smb.conf(5) option "<name>" to value "<value>" from the
           command line. This overrides compiled-in defaults and options read
           from the configuration file. If a name or a value includes a space,
           wrap whole --option=name=value into quotes.

       -l|--log-basename=logdirectory
           Base directory name for log/debug files. The extension ".progname"
           will be appended (e.g. log.smbclient, log.smbd, etc...). The log
           file is never removed by the client.

       --leak-report
           Enable talloc leak reporting on exit.

       --leak-report-full
           Enable full talloc leak reporting on exit.

       -V|--version
           Prints the program version number.

       -R|--name-resolve=NAME-RESOLVE-ORDER
           This option is used to determine what naming services and in what
           order to resolve host names to IP addresses. The option takes a
           space-separated string of different name resolution options. The
           best ist to wrap the whole --name-resolve=NAME-RESOLVE-ORDER into
           quotes.

           The options are: "lmhosts", "host", "wins" and "bcast". They cause
           names to be resolved as follows:

                  •   lmhosts: Lookup an IP address in the Samba lmhosts file.
                      If the line in lmhosts has no name type attached to the
                      NetBIOS name (see the lmhosts(5) for details) then any
                      name type matches for lookup.

                  •   host: Do a standard host name to IP address resolution,
                      using the system /etc/hosts, NIS, or DNS lookups. This
                      method of name resolution is operating system dependent,
                      for instance on IRIX or Solaris this may be controlled
                      by the /etc/nsswitch.conf file). Note that this method
                      is only used if the NetBIOS name type being queried is
                      the 0x20 (server) name type, otherwise it is ignored.

                  •   wins: Query a name with the IP address listed in the
                      wins server parameter. If no WINS server has been
                      specified this method will be ignored.

                  •   bcast: Do a broadcast on each of the known local
                      interfaces listed in the interfaces parameter. This is
                      the least reliable of the name resolution methods as it
                      depends on the target host being on a locally connected
                      subnet.

           If this parameter is not set then the name resolve order defined in
           the /etc/samba/smb.conf file parameter (name resolve order) will be
           used.

           The default order is lmhosts, host, wins, bcast. Without this
           parameter or any entry in the name resolve order parameter of the
           /etc/samba/smb.conf file, the name resolution methods will be
           attempted in this order.

       -O|--socket-options=SOCKETOPTIONS
           TCP socket options to set on the client socket. See the socket
           options parameter in the /etc/samba/smb.conf manual page for the
           list of valid options.

       -m|--max-protocol=MAXPROTOCOL
           The value of the parameter (a string) is the highest protocol level
           that will be supported by the client.

           Note that specifying this parameter here will override the client
           max protocol parameter in the /etc/samba/smb.conf file.

       -n|--netbiosname=NETBIOSNAME
           This option allows you to override the NetBIOS name that Samba uses
           for itself. This is identical to setting the netbios name parameter
           in the /etc/samba/smb.conf file. However, a command line setting
           will take precedence over settings in /etc/samba/smb.conf.

       --netbios-scope=SCOPE
           This specifies a NetBIOS scope that nmblookup will use to
           communicate with when generating NetBIOS names. For details on the
           use of NetBIOS scopes, see rfc1001.txt and rfc1002.txt. NetBIOS
           scopes are very rarely used, only set this parameter if you are the
           system administrator in charge of all the NetBIOS systems you
           communicate with.

       -W|--workgroup=WORKGROUP
           Set the SMB domain of the username. This overrides the default
           domain which is the domain defined in smb.conf. If the domain
           specified is the same as the servers NetBIOS name, it causes the
           client to log on using the servers local SAM (as opposed to the
           Domain SAM).

           Note that specifying this parameter here will override the
           workgroup parameter in the /etc/samba/smb.conf file.

       -r|--realm=REALM
           Set the realm for the domain.

           Note that specifying this parameter here will override the realm
           parameter in the /etc/samba/smb.conf file.

       -U|--user=[DOMAIN\]USERNAME[%PASSWORD]
           Sets the SMB username or username and password.

           If %PASSWORD is not specified, the user will be prompted. The
           client will first check the USER environment variable (which is
           also permitted to also contain the password separated by a %), then
           the LOGNAME variable (which is not permitted to contain a password)
           and if either exists, the value is used. If these environmental
           variables are not found, the username found in a Kerberos
           Credentials cache may be used.

           A third option is to use a credentials file which contains the
           plaintext of the username and password. This option is mainly
           provided for scripts where the admin does not wish to pass the
           credentials on the command line or via environment variables. If
           this method is used, make certain that the permissions on the file
           restrict access from unwanted users. See the -A for more details.

           Be cautious about including passwords in scripts or passing
           user-supplied values onto the command line. For security it is
           better to let the Samba client tool ask for the password if needed,
           or obtain the password once with kinit.

           While Samba will attempt to scrub the password from the process
           title (as seen in ps), this is after startup and so is subject to a
           race.

       -N|--no-pass
           If specified, this parameter suppresses the normal password prompt
           from the client to the user. This is useful when accessing a
           service that does not require a password.

           Unless a password is specified on the command line or this
           parameter is specified, the client will request a password.

           If a password is specified on the command line and this option is
           also defined the password on the command line will be silently
           ignored and no password will be used.

       --password
           Specify the password on the commandline.

           Be cautious about including passwords in scripts or passing
           user-supplied values onto the command line. For security it is
           better to let the Samba client tool ask for the password if needed,
           or obtain the password once with kinit.

           If --password is not specified, the tool will check the PASSWD
           environment variable, followed by PASSWD_FD which is expected to
           contain an open file descriptor (FD) number.

           Finally it will check PASSWD_FILE (containing a file path to be
           opened). The file should only contain the password. Make certain
           that the permissions on the file restrict access from unwanted
           users!

           While Samba will attempt to scrub the password from the process
           title (as seen in ps), this is after startup and so is subject to a
           race.

       --pw-nt-hash
           The supplied password is the NT hash.

       -A|--authentication-file=filename
           This option allows you to specify a file from which to read the
           username and password used in the connection. The format of the
           file is:

                                   username = <value>
                                   password = <value>
                                   domain   = <value>

           Make certain that the permissions on the file restrict access from
           unwanted users!

       -P|--machine-pass
           Use stored machine account password.

       --simple-bind-dn=DN
           DN to use for a simple bind.

       --use-kerberos=desired|required|off
           This parameter determines whether Samba client tools will try to
           authenticate using Kerberos. For Kerberos authentication you need
           to use dns names instead of IP addresses when connecting to a
           service.

           Note that specifying this parameter here will override the client
           use kerberos parameter in the /etc/samba/smb.conf file.

       --use-krb5-ccache=CCACHE
           Specifies the credential cache location for Kerberos
           authentication.

           This will set --use-kerberos=required too.

       --use-winbind-ccache
           Try to use the credential cache by winbind.

       --client-protection=sign|encrypt|off
           Sets the connection protection the client tool should use.

           Note that specifying this parameter here will override the client
           protection parameter in the /etc/samba/smb.conf file.

           In case you need more fine grained control you can use:
           --option=clientsmbencrypt=OPTION, --option=clientipcsigning=OPTION,
           --option=clientsigning=OPTION.

       adddriver <arch> <config> [<version>]
           Execute an AddPrinterDriver() RPC to install the printer driver
           information on the server. Note that the driver files should
           already exist in the directory returned by getdriverdir. Possible
           values for arch are the same as those for the getdriverdir command.
           The config parameter is defined as follows:

               Long Driver Name:\
               Driver File Name:\
               Data File Name:\
               Config File Name:\
               Help File Name:\
               Language Monitor Name:\
               Default Data Type:\
               Comma Separated list of Files

           Any empty fields should be enter as the string "NULL".

           Samba does not need to support the concept of Print Monitors since
           these only apply to local printers whose driver can make use of a
           bi-directional link for communication. This field should be "NULL".
           On a remote NT print server, the Print Monitor for a driver must
           already be installed prior to adding the driver or else the RPC
           will fail.

           The version parameter lets you specify the printer driver version
           number. If omitted, the default driver version for the specified
           architecture will be used. This option can be used to upload
           Windows 2000 (version 3) printer drivers.

       addprinter <printername> <sharename> <drivername> <port>
           Add a printer on the remote server. This printer will be
           automatically shared. Be aware that the printer driver must already
           be installed on the server (see adddriver) and the portmust be a
           valid port name (see enumports.

       deldriver <driver>
           Delete the specified printer driver for all architectures. This
           does not delete the actual driver files from the server, only the
           entry from the server's list of drivers.

       deldriverex <driver> [architecture] [version] [flags]
           Delete the specified printer driver and optionally files associated
           with the driver. You can limit this action to a specific
           architecture and a specific version. If no architecture is given,
           all driver files of that driver will be deleted.  flags correspond
           to numeric DPD_* values, i.e. a value of 3 requests
           (DPD_DELETE_UNUSED_FILES | DPD_DELETE_SPECIFIC_VERSION).

       enumdata
           Enumerate all printer setting data stored on the server. On Windows
           NT clients, these values are stored in the registry, while Samba
           servers store them in the printers TDB. This command corresponds to
           the MS Platform SDK GetPrinterData() function (* This command is
           currently unimplemented).

       enumdataex
           Enumerate printer data for a key

       enumkey
           Enumerate printer keys

       enumjobs <printer>
           List the jobs and status of a given printer. This command
           corresponds to the MS Platform SDK EnumJobs() function

       getjob
           Get print job

       setjob
           Set print job

       enumports [level]
           Executes an EnumPorts() call using the specified info level.
           Currently only info levels 1 and 2 are supported.

       enumdrivers [level]
           Execute an EnumPrinterDrivers() call. This lists the various
           installed printer drivers for all architectures. Refer to the MS
           Platform SDK documentation for more details of the various flags
           and calling options. Currently supported info levels are 1, 2, and
           3.

       enumprinters [level]
           Execute an EnumPrinters() call. This lists the various installed
           and share printers. Refer to the MS Platform SDK documentation for
           more details of the various flags and calling options. Currently
           supported info levels are 1, 2 and 5.

       getdata <printername> <valuename;>
           Retrieve the data for a given printer setting. See the enumdata
           command for more information. This command corresponds to the
           GetPrinterData() MS Platform SDK function.

       getdataex
           Get printer driver data with keyname

       getdriver <printername>
           Retrieve the printer driver information (such as driver file,
           config file, dependent files, etc...) for the given printer. This
           command corresponds to the GetPrinterDriver() MS Platform SDK
           function. Currently info level 1, 2, and 3 are supported.

       getdriverdir <arch>
           Execute a GetPrinterDriverDirectory() RPC to retrieve the SMB share
           name and subdirectory for storing printer driver files for a given
           architecture. Possible values for arch are "Windows 4.0" (for
           Windows 95/98), "Windows NT x86", "Windows NT PowerPC", "Windows
           Alpha_AXP", and "Windows NT R4000".

       getdriverpackagepath
           Get print driver package download directory

       getprinter <printername>
           Retrieve the current printer information. This command corresponds
           to the GetPrinter() MS Platform SDK function.

       openprinter <printername>
           Execute an OpenPrinterEx() and ClosePrinter() RPC against a given
           printer.

       openprinter_ex <printername>
           Open printer handle

       setdriver <printername> <drivername>
           Execute a SetPrinter() command to update the printer driver
           associated with an installed printer. The printer driver must
           already be correctly installed on the print server.

           See also the enumprinters and enumdrivers commands for obtaining a
           list of of installed printers and drivers.

BUGS
       rpcclient is designed as a developer testing tool and may not be robust
       in certain areas (such as command line parsing). It has been known to
       generate a core dump upon failures when invalid parameters where passed
       to the interpreter.

       From Luke Leighton's original rpcclient man page:

       WARNING!  The MSRPC over SMB code has been developed from examining
       Network traces. No documentation is available from the original
       creators (Microsoft) on how MSRPC over SMB works, or how the individual
       MSRPC services work. Microsoft's implementation of these services has
       been demonstrated (and reported) to be... a bit flaky in places.

       The development of Samba's implementation is also a bit rough, and as
       more of the services are understood, it can even result in versions of
       smbd(8) and rpcclient(1) that are incompatible for some commands or
       services. Additionally, the developers are sending reports to
       Microsoft, and problems found or reported to Microsoft are fixed in
       Service Packs, which may result in incompatibilities.

VERSION
       This man page is part of version 4.18.1 of the Samba suite.

AUTHOR
       The original Samba software and related utilities were created by
       Andrew Tridgell. Samba is now developed by the Samba Team as an Open
       Source project similar to the way the Linux kernel is developed.

       The original rpcclient man page was written by Matthew Geddes, Luke
       Kenneth Casson Leighton, and rewritten by Gerald Carter. The conversion
       to DocBook for Samba 2.2 was done by Gerald Carter. The conversion to
       DocBook XML 4.2 for Samba 3.0 was done by Alexander Bokovoy.
