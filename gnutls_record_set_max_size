NAME
       gnutls_record_set_max_size - API function

SYNOPSIS
       #include <gnutls/gnutls.h>

       ssize_t gnutls_record_set_max_size(gnutls_session_t session, size_t size);

ARGUMENTS
       gnutls_session_t session
                   is a gnutls_session_t type.

       size_t size is the new size

DESCRIPTION
       This function sets the maximum amount of plaintext sent and received in a record in this connection.

       Prior to 3.6.4, this function was implemented using a TLS extension called 'max fragment length', which limits the acceptable values to 512(=2^9), 1024(=2^10), 2048(=2^11) and 4096(=2^12).

       Since  3.6.4, the limit is also negotiated through a new TLS extension called 'record size limit', which doesn't have the limitation, as long as the value ranges between 512 and 16384.  Note that
       while the 'record size limit' extension is preferred, not all TLS implementations use or even understand the extension.

DEPRECATED
       if the client can assume that the 'record size limit' extension is supported by the server, we recommend using gnutls_record_set_max_recv_size() instead.

RETURNS
       On success, GNUTLS_E_SUCCESS (0) is returned, otherwise a negative error code is returned.
