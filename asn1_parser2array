NAME
       asn1_parser2array - API function

SYNOPSIS
       #include <libtasn1.h>

       int asn1_parser2array(const char * inputFileName, const char * outputFileName, const char * vectorName, char * error_desc);

ARGUMENTS
       const char * inputFileName
                   specify the path and the name of file that contains ASN.1 declarations.

       const char * outputFileName
                   specify the path and the name of file that will contain the C vector definition.

       const char * vectorName
                   specify the name of the C vector.

       char * error_desc
                   return the error description or an empty string if success.

DESCRIPTION
       Function  that  generates  a  C  structure  from  an  ASN1  file.   Creates  a  file  containing  a C vector to use to manage the definitions included in  inputFileName file. If  inputFileName is
       "/aa/bb/xx.yy" and  outputFileName is NULL, the file created is "/aa/bb/xx_asn1_tab.c".  If  vectorName is NULL the vector name will be "xx_asn1_tab".

RETURNS
       ASN1_SUCCESS if the file has a correct syntax and every identifier is known, ASN1_FILE_NOT_FOUND if an error occurred while opening  inputFileName , ASN1_SYNTAX_ERROR if the syntax  is  not  cor‐
       rect, ASN1_IDENTIFIER_NOT_FOUND if in the file there is an identifier that is not defined, ASN1_NAME_TOO_LONG if in the file there is an identifier with more than ASN1_MAX_NAME_SIZE characters.
