                 The type of this reply, in this case XCB_DRI2_GET_BUFFERS. This field is also present in the xcb_generic_reply_t and can be used to tell replies apart from each other.

       sequence  The sequence number of the last request processed by the X11 server.

       length    The length of the reply, in words (a word is 4 bytes).

       width     TODO: NOT YET DOCUMENTED.

       height    TODO: NOT YET DOCUMENTED.

DESCRIPTION
RETURN VALUE
       Returns an xcb_dri2_get_buffers_cookie_t. Errors have to be handled when calling the reply function xcb_dri2_get_buffers_reply.

       If you want to handle errors in the event loop instead, use xcb_dri2_get_buffers_unchecked. See xcb-requests(3) for details.

ERRORS
       This request does never generate any errors.
