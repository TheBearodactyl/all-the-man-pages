PROLOG
       This  manual  page is part of the POSIX Programmer's Manual.  The Linux
       implementation of this interface may differ (consult the  corresponding
       Linux  manual page for details of Linux behavior), or the interface may
       not be implemented on Linux.

NAME
       syslog.h — definitions for system error logging

SYNOPSIS
       #include <syslog.h>

DESCRIPTION
       The <syslog.h> header shall define the  following  symbolic  constants,
       zero  or  more of which may be OR'ed together to form the logopt option
       of openlog():

       LOG_PID       Log the process ID with each message.

       LOG_CONS      Log to the system console on error.

       LOG_NDELAY    Connect to syslog daemon immediately.

       LOG_ODELAY    Delay open until syslog() is called.

       LOG_NOWAIT    Do not wait for child processes.

       The <syslog.h> header shall define the following symbolic constants for
       use as the facility argument to openlog():

       LOG_KERN      Reserved for message generated by the system.

       LOG_USER      Message generated by a process.

       LOG_MAIL      Reserved for message generated by mail system.

       LOG_NEWS      Reserved for message generated by news system.

       LOG_UUCP      Reserved for message generated by UUCP system.

       LOG_DAEMON    Reserved for message generated by system daemon.

       LOG_AUTH      Reserved for message generated by authorization daemon.

       LOG_CRON      Reserved for message generated by clock daemon.

       LOG_LPR       Reserved for message generated by printer system.

       LOG_LOCAL0    Reserved for local use.

       LOG_LOCAL1    Reserved for local use.

       LOG_LOCAL2    Reserved for local use.

       LOG_LOCAL3    Reserved for local use.

       LOG_LOCAL4    Reserved for local use.

       LOG_LOCAL5    Reserved for local use.

       LOG_LOCAL6    Reserved for local use.

       LOG_LOCAL7    Reserved for local use.

       The  <syslog.h> header shall define the following macros for construct‐
       ing the maskpri argument to setlogmask().  The following macros  expand
       to  an expression of type int when the argument pri is an expression of
       type int:

       LOG_MASK(pri) A mask for priority pri.

       The <syslog.h> header shall define the following symbolic constants for
       use as the priority argument of syslog():

       LOG_EMERG     A panic condition was reported to all processes.

       LOG_ALERT     A condition that should be corrected immediately.

       LOG_CRIT      A critical condition.

       LOG_ERR       An error message.

       LOG_WARNING   A warning message.

       LOG_NOTICE    A condition requiring special handling.

       LOG_INFO      A general information message.

       LOG_DEBUG     A message useful for debugging programs.

       The following shall be declared as functions and may also be defined as
       macros. Function prototypes shall be provided.

           void  closelog(void);
           void  openlog(const char *, int, int);
           int   setlogmask(int);
           void  syslog(int, const char *, ...);
