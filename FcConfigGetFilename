NAME
       FcConfigGetFilename - Find a config file

SYNOPSIS
       #include <fontconfig/fontconfig.h>

       FcChar8 * FcConfigGetFilename (FcConfig *config, const FcChar8 *name);

DESCRIPTION
       Given the specified external entity name, return the associated filename.  This provides applications a way to convert various configuration file references into filename form.

       A  null  or empty name indicates that the default configuration file should be used; which file this references can be overridden with the FONTCONFIG_FILE environment variable.  Next, if the name
       starts with ~, it refers to a file in the current users home directory.  Otherwise if the name doesn't start with '/', it refers to a file in the default configuration directory; the built-in de‚Äê
       fault directory can be overridden with the FONTCONFIG_PATH environment variable.

       The result of this function is affected by the FONTCONFIG_SYSROOT environment variable or equivalent functionality.
