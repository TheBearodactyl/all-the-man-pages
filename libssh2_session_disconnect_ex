NAME
       libssh2_session_disconnect_ex - terminate transport layer

SYNOPSIS
       #include <libssh2.h>

       int libssh2_session_disconnect_ex(LIBSSH2_SESSION *session, int reason, const char *description, const char *lang);

       int libssh2_session_disconnect(LIBSSH2_SESSION *session, const char *description);

DESCRIPTION
       session - Session instance as returned by libssh2_session_init_ex(3)

       reason - One of the Disconnect Reason constants.

       description - Human readable reason for disconnection.

       lang - Localization string describing the language/encoding of the description provided.

       Send a disconnect message to the remote host associated with session, along with a reason symbol and a verbose description.

       As a convenience, the macro libssh2_session_disconnect(3) is provided. It calls libssh2_session_disconnect_ex(3) with reason set to SSH_DISCONNECT_BY_APPLICATION and lang set to an empty string.

RETURN VALUE
       Return 0 on success or negative on failure.  It returns LIBSSH2_ERROR_EAGAIN when it would otherwise block. While LIBSSH2_ERROR_EAGAIN is a negative number, it isn't really a failure per se.
