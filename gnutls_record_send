NAME
       gnutls_record_send - API function

SYNOPSIS
       #include <gnutls/gnutls.h>

       ssize_t gnutls_record_send(gnutls_session_t session, const void * data, size_t data_size);

ARGUMENTS
       gnutls_session_t session
                   is a gnutls_session_t type.

       const void * data
                   contains the data to send

       size_t data_size
                   is the length of the data

DESCRIPTION
       This  function  has the similar semantics with send().  The only difference is that it accepts a GnuTLS session, and uses different error codes.  Note that if the send buffer is full, send() will
       block this function.  See the send() documentation for more information.

       You can replace the default push function which is send(), by using gnutls_transport_set_push_function().

       If the EINTR is returned by the internal push function then GNUTLS_E_INTERRUPTED will be returned. If GNUTLS_E_INTERRUPTED or GNUTLS_E_AGAIN is returned, you must call this  function  again  with
       the  exact same parameters, or provide a NULL pointer for  data and 0 for  data_size , in order to write the same data as before. If you wish to discard the previous data instead of retrying, you
       must call gnutls_record_discard_queued() before calling this function with different parameters. Note that the latter works only on special transports (e.g., UDP).   cf.  gnutls_record_get_direc‐
       tion().

       Note  that  in DTLS this function will return the GNUTLS_E_LARGE_PACKET error code if the send data exceed the data MTU value - as returned by gnutls_dtls_get_data_mtu(). The errno value EMSGSIZE
       also maps to GNUTLS_E_LARGE_PACKET.  Note that since 3.2.13 this function can be called under cork in DTLS mode, and will refuse to send data over the MTU size by returning GNUTLS_E_LARGE_PACKET.

RETURNS
       The number of bytes sent, or a negative error code.  The number of bytes sent might be less than  data_size .  The maximum number of bytes this function can send in a single call depends  on  the
       negotiated maximum record size.
