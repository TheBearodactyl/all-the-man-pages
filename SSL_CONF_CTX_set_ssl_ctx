SSL_CONF_CTX_SET_SSL_CTX(3ssl)      OpenSSL     SSL_CONF_CTX_SET_SSL_CTX(3ssl)

NAME
       SSL_CONF_CTX_set_ssl_ctx, SSL_CONF_CTX_set_ssl - set context to
       configure

SYNOPSIS
        #include <openssl/ssl.h>

        void SSL_CONF_CTX_set_ssl_ctx(SSL_CONF_CTX *cctx, SSL_CTX *ctx);
        void SSL_CONF_CTX_set_ssl(SSL_CONF_CTX *cctx, SSL *ssl);

DESCRIPTION
       SSL_CONF_CTX_set_ssl_ctx() sets the context associated with cctx to the
       SSL_CTX structure ctx. Any previous SSL or SSL_CTX associated with cctx
       is cleared. Subsequent calls to SSL_CONF_cmd() will be sent to ctx.

       SSL_CONF_CTX_set_ssl() sets the context associated with cctx to the SSL
       structure ssl. Any previous SSL or SSL_CTX associated with cctx is
       cleared. Subsequent calls to SSL_CONF_cmd() will be sent to ssl.

NOTES
       The context need not be set or it can be set to NULL in which case only
       syntax checking of commands is performed, where possible.

RETURN VALUES
       SSL_CONF_CTX_set_ssl_ctx() and SSL_CTX_set_ssl() do not return a value.
