SRP_USER_PWD_NEW(3ssl)              OpenSSL             SRP_USER_PWD_NEW(3ssl)

NAME
       SRP_user_pwd_new, SRP_user_pwd_free, SRP_user_pwd_set1_ids,
       SRP_user_pwd_set_gN, SRP_user_pwd_set0_sv - Functions to create a
       record of SRP user verifier information

SYNOPSIS
        #include <openssl/srp.h>

       The following functions have been deprecated since OpenSSL 3.0, and can
       be hidden entirely by defining OPENSSL_API_COMPAT with a suitable
       version value, see openssl_user_macros(7):

        SRP_user_pwd *SRP_user_pwd_new(void);
        void SRP_user_pwd_free(SRP_user_pwd *user_pwd);

        int SRP_user_pwd_set1_ids(SRP_user_pwd *user_pwd, const char *id, const char *info);
        void SRP_user_pwd_set_gN(SRP_user_pwd *user_pwd, const BIGNUM *g, const BIGNUM *N);
        int SRP_user_pwd_set0_sv(SRP_user_pwd *user_pwd, BIGNUM *s, BIGNUM *v);

DESCRIPTION
       All of the functions described on this page are deprecated. There are
       no available replacement functions at this time.

       The SRP_user_pwd_new() function allocates a structure to store a user
       verifier record.

       The SRP_user_pwd_free() function frees up the user_pwd structure.  If
       user_pwd is NULL, nothing is done.

       The SRP_user_pwd_set1_ids() function sets the username to id and the
       optional user info to info for user_pwd.  The library allocates new
       copies of id and info, the caller still owns the original memory.

       The SRP_user_pwd_set0_sv() function sets the user salt to s and the
       verifier to v for user_pwd.  The library takes ownership of the values,
       they should not be freed by the caller.

       The SRP_user_pwd_set_gN() function sets the SRP group parameters for
       user_pwd.  The memory is not freed by SRP_user_pwd_free(), the caller
       must make sure it is freed once it is no longer used.

RETURN VALUES
       SRP_user_pwd_set1_ids() returns 1 on success and 0 on failure or if id
       was NULL.

       SRP_user_pwd_set0_sv() returns 1 if both s and v are not NULL, 0
       otherwise.
