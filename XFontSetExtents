NAME
       XFontSetExtents - XFontSetExtents structure

STRUCTURES
       The XFontSetExtents structure contains:

       typedef struct {
               XRectangle max_ink_extent;      /* over all drawable characters */
               XRectangle max_logical_extent;  /* over all drawable characters */
       } XFontSetExtents;

       The XRectangle structures used to return font set metrics are the usual Xlib screen-oriented rectangles with x, y giving the upper left corner, and width and height always positive.

       The max_ink_extent member gives the maximum extent, over all drawable characters, of the rectangles that bound the character glyph image drawn in the foreground color, relative to a constant ori‐
       gin.  See XmbTextExtents and XwcTextExtents for detailed semantics.

       The max_logical_extent member gives the maximum extent, over all drawable characters, of the rectangles that specify minimum spacing to other graphical features, relative to  a  constant  origin.
       Other graphical features drawn by the client, for example, a border surrounding the text, should not intersect this rectangle.  The max_logical_extent member should be used to compute minimum in‐
       terline spacing and the minimum area that must be allowed in a text field to draw a given number of arbitrary characters.

       Due to context-dependent rendering, appending a given character to a string may change the string's extent by an amount other than that character's individual extent.
