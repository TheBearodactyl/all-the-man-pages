NAME
       TIFFcodec - codec-related utility routines

SYNOPSIS
          #include <tiffio.h>

       const TIFFCodec *TIFFFindCODEC(uint16_t scheme)

       TIFFCodec *TIFFRegisterCODEC(uint16_t scheme, const char *method, TIFFInitMethod init)

       void TIFFUnRegisterCODEC(TIFFCodec *codec)

       int TIFFIsCODECConfigured(uint16_t scheme)

       TIFFCodec *TIFFGetConfiguredCODECs(uint16_t scheme)

       int TIFFSetCompressionScheme(TIFF *tif, int scheme)

DESCRIPTION
       libtiff  supports  a variety of compression schemes implemented by software codecs. Each codec adheres to a modular interface that provides for the decoding and encoding of image data; as well as
       some other methods for initialization, setup, cleanup, and the control of default strip and tile sizes.  Codecs are identified by the associated value of the TIFF Compression tag; e.g. 5 for  LZW
       compression.

       TIFFFindCODEC()  ??????

       TIFFUnRegisterCODEC() ?????

       The TIFFRegisterCODEC() routine can be used to augment or override the set of codecs available to an application.  If the specified scheme already has a registered codec then it is overridden and
       any images with data encoded with this compression scheme will be decoded using the supplied codec.

       TIFFIsCODECConfigured() returns 1 if the codec is configured and working. Otherwise 0 will be returned.

       TIFFGetConfiguredCODECs() gets list of configured codecs, both built-in and registered by user. Function returns array of TIFFCodec records (the last record should be NULL) or  NULL  if  function
       failed. Caller is responsible to free this structure.

       TIFFSetCompressionScheme()  ????

DIAGNOSTICS
       No space to register compression scheme %s:
          TIFFRegisterCODEC() was unable to allocate memory for the data structures needed to register a codec.

       Cannot remove compression scheme %s; not registered:
          TIFFUnRegisterCODEC() did not locate the specified codec in the table of registered compression schemes.
