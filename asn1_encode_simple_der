NAME
       asn1_encode_simple_der - API function

SYNOPSIS
       #include <libtasn1.h>

       int asn1_encode_simple_der(unsigned int etype, const unsigned char * str, unsigned int str_len, unsigned char * tl, unsigned int * tl_len);

ARGUMENTS
       unsigned int etype
                   The type of the string to be encoded (ASN1_ETYPE_)

       const unsigned char * str
                   the string data.

       unsigned int str_len
                   the string length

       unsigned char * tl
                   the encoded tag and length

       unsigned int * tl_len
                   the bytes of the  tl field

DESCRIPTION
       Creates  the  DER  encoding  for various simple ASN.1 types like strings etc.  It stores the tag and length in  tl , which should have space for at least ASN1_MAX_TL_SIZE bytes. Initially  tl_len
       should contain the size of  tl .

       The complete DER encoding should consist of the value in  tl appended with the provided  str .

RETURNS
       ASN1_SUCCESS if successful or an error value.
