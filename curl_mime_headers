NAME
       curl_mime_headers - set a mime part's custom headers

SYNOPSIS
       #include <curl/curl.h>

       CURLcode curl_mime_headers(curl_mimepart *part,
                                  struct curl_slist *headers, int take_ownership);

DESCRIPTION
       curl_mime_headers(3) sets a mime part's custom headers.

       part is the part's handle to assign the custom headers list to.

       headers is the head of a list of custom headers; it may be set to NULL to remove a previously attached custom header list.

       take_ownership: when non-zero, causes the list to be freed upon replacement or mime structure deletion; in this case the list must not be freed explicitly.

       Setting a part's custom headers list multiple times is valid: only the value set by the last call is retained.

EXAMPLE
        struct curl_slist *headers = NULL;

        headers = curl_slist_append(headers, "Custom-Header: mooo");

        /* use these headers, please take ownership */
        curl_mime_headers(part, headers, TRUE);

        /* pass on this data */
        curl_mime_data(part, "12345679", CURL_ZERO_TERMINATED);

        /* set name */
        curl_mime_name(part, "numbers");

AVAILABILITY
       As long as at least one of HTTP, SMTP or IMAP is enabled. Added in 7.56.0.

RETURN VALUE
       CURLE_OK or a CURL error code upon failure.
