NAME
       XkbSARedirectSetVMods - Sets the vmods0 and vmods1 of act from v

SYNOPSIS
       void XkbSARedirectSetVMods (XkbRedirectKeyAction act, unsigned int v);

ARGUMENTS
       act    action in which to set vmods

       v      new value for virtual modifiers

DESCRIPTION
       Actions associated with the XkbRedirectKeyAction structure generate KeyPress and KeyRelease events containing a keycode different from the key that was pressed or released.

       The type field for the XkbRedirectKeyAction structure should always be XkbSA_RedirectKey.  Key presses cause a KeyPress event for the key specified by the new_key field instead of the actual key.
       The state reported in this event reports the current effective modifiers changed as follows: any real modifiers selected by the mods_mask field are set  to  corresponding  values  from  the  mods
       field.  Any  real  modifiers  bound to the virtual modifiers specified by the vmods_mask0 and vmods_mask1 fields are either set or cleared, depending on the corresponding values in the vmods0 and
       vmods1 fields. If the real and virtual modifier definitions specify conflicting values for a single modifier, the real modifier definition has priority.

       Key releases cause a KeyRelease event for the key specified by the new_key field instead of the actual key. The state for this event consists of the effective keyboard modifiers at  the  time  of
       the release, changed as described previously.

       The  XkbSA_RedirectKey  action  normally redirects to another key on the same device as the key that caused the event, unless that device does not belong to the input extension KeyClass, in which
       case this action causes an event on the core keyboard device. (The input extension categorizes devices by breaking them into classes. Keyboards, and other input devices with keys, are  classified
       as KeyClass devices by the input extension.)

       The vmods_mask0 and vmods_mask1 fields actually represent one vmods_mask value. Xkb provides macros to convert between the two formats.

       XkbSARedirectSetVModsMask sets the vmods0 and vmods1 of act from v.
