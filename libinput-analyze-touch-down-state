       libinput-analyze-touch-down-state - analyze the touch states

SYNOPSIS
       libinput analyze touch-down-state [--help] [options] recording.yml

DESCRIPTION
       The libinput analyze touch-downte tool analyzes a recording made with libinput record and prints "down" state of each touch. This tool aids with the detection of stuck touches.

       This is a debugging tool only, its output may change at any time. Do not rely on the output.

OPTIONS
       --help  Print help

       --use-st
               Use  the  single-touch BTN_TOOL_ bits instead of the slot state. The output will only show the "highest" finger down at any time. For examples, where two fingers are down, only the second
               slot will be marked as down.

OUTPUT
       An example output for a two-finger alternating sequence below.
