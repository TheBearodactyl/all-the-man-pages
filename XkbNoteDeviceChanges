NAME
       XkbNoteDeviceChanges - Note device changes reported in an XkbExtensionDeviceNotify event

SYNOPSIS
       void XkbNoteDeviceChanges (XkbDeviceChangesPtr old, XkbExtensionDeviceNotifyEvent *new, unsigned int wanted);

ARGUMENTS
       old    structure tracking state changes

       new    event indicating state changes

       wanted mask indicating changes to note

DESCRIPTION
       The  wanted field specifies the changes that should be noted in old, and is composed of the bitwise inclusive OR of one or more of the masks from Table 1. The reason field of the event in new in‐
       dicates the types of changes the event is reporting.  XkbNoteDeviceChanges updates the XkbDeviceChangesRec specified by old with the changes that are both specified in  wanted  and  contained  in
       new->reason.

       To update a local copy of the state and configuration of an X input extension device with the changes previously noted in an XkbDeviceChangesRec structure, use XkbGetDeviceInfoChanges.

STRUCTURES
       Changes to an Xkb extension device may be tracked by listening to XkbDeviceExtensionNotify events and accumulating the changes in an XkbDeviceChangesRec structure. The changes noted in the struc‐
       ture may then be used in subsequent operations to update either a server configuration or a local copy of an Xkb extension device configuration. The changes structure is defined as follows:

       typedef struct _XkbDeviceChanges {
           unsigned int         changed;       /* bits indicating what has changed */
           unsigned short       first_btn;     /* number of first button which changed, if any */
           unsigned short       num_btns;      /* number of buttons that have changed */
           XkbDeviceLedChangesRec leds;
       } XkbDeviceChangesRec,*XkbDeviceChangesPtr;
