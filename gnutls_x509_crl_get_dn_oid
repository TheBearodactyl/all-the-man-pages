NAME
       gnutls_x509_crl_get_dn_oid - API function

SYNOPSIS
       #include <gnutls/x509.h>

       int gnutls_x509_crl_get_dn_oid(gnutls_x509_crl_t crl, unsigned indx, void * oid, size_t * sizeof_oid);

ARGUMENTS
       gnutls_x509_crl_t crl
                   should contain a gnutls_x509_crl_t type

       unsigned indx
                   Specifies which DN OID to send. Use (0) to get the first one.

       void * oid  a pointer to store the OID (may be null)

       size_t * sizeof_oid
                   initially holds the size of 'oid'

DESCRIPTION
       This function will extract the requested OID of the name of the CRL issuer, specified by the given index.

       If oid is null then only the size will be filled.

RETURNS
       GNUTLS_E_SHORT_MEMORY_BUFFER if the provided buffer is not long enough, and in that case the sizeof_oid will be updated with the required size.  On success 0 is returned.
