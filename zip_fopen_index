ZIP_FOPEN(3)                                                                           BSD Library Functions Manual                                                                           ZIP_FOPEN(3)

NAME
     zip_fopen, zip_fopen_index â€” open file in zip archive for reading

LIBRARY
     libzip (-lzip)

SYNOPSIS
     #include <zip.h>

     zip_file_t *
     zip_fopen(zip_t *archive, const char *fname, zip_flags_t flags);

     zip_file_t *
     zip_fopen_index(zip_t *archive, zip_uint64_t index, zip_flags_t flags);

DESCRIPTION
     The zip_fopen() function opens the file name fname in archive.  The flags argument specifies how the name lookup should be done, according to the values are described in zip_name_locate(3).  Also,
     the following values may be or'ed to it.

           ZIP_FL_COMPRESSED  Read the compressed data.  Otherwise the data is uncompressed by zip_fread().

           ZIP_FL_UNCHANGED   Read the original data from the zip archive, ignoring any changes made to the file.

     The zip_fopen_index() function opens the file at position index.

     If encrypted data is encountered, the functions call zip_fopen_encrypted(3) or zip_fopen_index_encrypted(3) respectively, using the default password set with zip_set_default_password(3).

RETURN VALUES
     Upon successful completion, a struct zip_file pointer is returned.  Otherwise, NULL is returned and the error code in archive is set to indicate the error.

ERRORS
     [ZIP_ER_CHANGED]   The file data has been changed.

     [ZIP_ER_COMPNOTSUPP]
                        The compression method used is not supported.

     [ZIP_ER_ENCRNOTSUPP]
                        The encryption method used is not supported.

     [ZIP_ER_MEMORY]    Required memory could not be allocated.

     [ZIP_ER_NOPASSWD]  The file is encrypted, but no password has been provided.

     [ZIP_ER_READ]      A file read error occurred.

     [ZIP_ER_SEEK]      A file seek error occurred.

     [ZIP_ER_WRONGPASSWD]
                        The provided password does not match the password used for encryption.  Note that some incorrect passwords are not detected by the check done by zip_fopen().

     [ZIP_ER_ZLIB]      Initializing the zlib stream failed.

     The function zip_fopen() may also fail and set zip_err for any of the errors specified for the routine zip_name_locate(3).

     The function zip_fopen_index() may also fail with ZIP_ER_INVAL if index is invalid.
