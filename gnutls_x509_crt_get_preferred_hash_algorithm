NAME
       gnutls_x509_crt_get_preferred_hash_algorithm - API function

SYNOPSIS
       #include <gnutls/compat.h>

       int gnutls_x509_crt_get_preferred_hash_algorithm(gnutls_x509_crt_t crt, gnutls_digest_algorithm_t *           hash, unsigned int * mand);

ARGUMENTS
       gnutls_x509_crt_t crt
                   Holds the certificate

       gnutls_digest_algorithm_t *           hash
                   The result of the call with the hash algorithm used for signature

       unsigned int * mand
                   If non-zero it means that the algorithm MUST use this hash. May be NULL.

DESCRIPTION
       This  function  will  read the certificate and return the appropriate digest algorithm to use for signing with this certificate. Some certificates (i.e.  DSA might not be able to sign without the
       preferred algorithm).

DEPRECATED
       Please use gnutls_pubkey_get_preferred_hash_algorithm().

RETURNS
       the 0 if the hash algorithm is found. A negative error code is returned on error.

SINCE
       2.12.0
