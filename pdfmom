NAME
       pdfmom - produce PDF documents using the mom macro package for groff

SYNOPSIS
       pdfmom [-Tpdf] [groff-options] file ...

       pdfmom -Tps [pdfroff-options] [groff-options] file ...

       pdfmom -v

DESCRIPTION
       pdfmom  is a wrapper around groff(1) that facilitates the production of
       PDF documents from files formatted with the mom macros.

       pdfmom prints to the standard output, so output must usually  be  redi‐
       rected to a destination file.  The size of the final PDF can be reduced
       by piping the output through ps2pdf(1).

       If called with the -Tpdf option (which is  the  default),  pdfmom  pro‐
       cesses  files  using  groff's native PDF driver, gropdf(1).  If -Tps is
       given, processing is passed over to pdfroff, which uses  groff's  Post‐
       Script  driver.   In  either case, multiple runs of the source file are
       performed in order to satisfy any forward references in the document.

       pdfmom accepts all the same options as groff.  If -Tps  is  given,  the
       options associated with pdfroff are accepted as well.  Please note that
       when pdfmom calls pdfroff, the
              -mpdfmark -mom --no-toc
       options are implied and should  not  be  given  on  the  command  line.
       Equally,  it is not necessary to supply the -mom or -m mom options when
       -Tps is absent.

       PDF integration with the mom macros is discussed in full in the  manual
       Producing  PDFs with groff and mom, which was itself produced with pdf‐
       mom.

       If called with the -v option, pdfmom simply displays its version infor‐
       mation and exits.

BUGS
       pdfmom sometimes issues warnings of the type
              ...: can't transparently output node at top level
       but this is more of an annoyance than a bug, and may safely be ignored.
