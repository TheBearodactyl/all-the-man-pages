NAME
       XkbGetDeviceButtonActions - Query the button actions associated with an X Input Extension device

SYNOPSIS
       Status XkbGetDeviceButtonActions (Display *dpy, XkbDeviceInfoPtr device_info, Bool all_buttons, unsigned int first_button, unsigned int num_buttons);

ARGUMENTS
       dpy    connection to X server

       device_info
              structure to update with results

       all_buttons
              True => get information for all buttons

       first_button
              number of first button for which info is desired

       num_buttons
              number of buttons for which info is desired

DESCRIPTION
       XkbGetDeviceButtonActions  queries  the  server for the desired button information for the device indicated by the device_spec field of device_info and waits for a reply. If successful, XkbGetDe‐
       viceButtonActions backfills the button actions (btn_acts field of device_info) for only the requested buttons, updates the name, type, supported, and unsupported fields, and returns Success.

       all_buttons, first_button and num_buttons specify the device buttons for which actions should be returned. Setting all_buttons to True requests actions for all device buttons; if  all_buttons  is
       False, first_button and num_buttons specify a range of buttons for which actions are requested.

       If  a  compatible  version of Xkb is not available in the server or the Xkb extension has not been properly initialized, XkbGetDeviceButtonActions returns BadAccess. If allocation errors occur, a
       BadAlloc status is returned. If the specified device (device_info->device_spec) is invalid, a BadKeyboard status is returned. If the device has no buttons,  a  BadMatch  status  is  returned.  If
       first_button and num_buttons specify illegal buttons, a BadValue status is returned.

DIAGNOSTICS

       BadAlloc       Unable to allocate storage

       BadKeyboard    The device specified was not a valid core or input extension device

       BadMatch       A compatible version of Xkb was not available in the server or an argument has correct type and range, but is otherwise invalid
