NAME
       __gnu_cxx::subtractive_rng

SYNOPSIS
       Inherits std::unary_function< unsigned int, unsigned int >.

   Public Types
       typedef unsigned int argument_type
           argument_type is the type of the argument
       typedef unsigned int result_type
           result_type is the return type

   Public Member Functions
       subtractive_rng ()
           Default ctor; initializes its state with some number you don't see.
       subtractive_rng (unsigned int __seed)
           Ctor allowing you to initialize the seed.
       void _M_initialize (unsigned int __seed)
       unsigned int operator() (unsigned int __limit)
           Returns a number less than the argument.

Detailed Description
       The subtractive_rng class is documented on SGI's site. Note that this code assumes that int is 32 bits.
