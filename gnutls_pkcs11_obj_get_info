NAME
       gnutls_pkcs11_obj_get_info - API function

SYNOPSIS
       #include <gnutls/pkcs11.h>

       int gnutls_pkcs11_obj_get_info(gnutls_pkcs11_obj_t obj, gnutls_pkcs11_obj_info_t itype, void * output, size_t * output_size);

ARGUMENTS
       gnutls_pkcs11_obj_t obj
                   should contain a gnutls_pkcs11_obj_t type

       gnutls_pkcs11_obj_info_t itype
                   Denotes the type of information requested

       void * output
                   where output will be stored

       size_t * output_size
                   contains the maximum size of the output buffer and will be overwritten with the actual size.

DESCRIPTION
       This function will return information about the PKCS11 certificate such as the label, id as well as token information where the key is stored.

       When  output is text, a null terminated string is written to  output and its string length is written to  output_size (without null terminator). If the buffer is too small,  output_size will con‐
       tain the expected buffer size (with null terminator for text) and return GNUTLS_E_SHORT_MEMORY_BUFFER.

       In versions previously to 3.6.0 this function included the null terminator to  output_size . After 3.6.0 the output size doesn't include the terminator character.

RETURNS
       GNUTLS_E_SUCCESS (0) on success or a negative error code on error.

SINCE
       2.12.0
