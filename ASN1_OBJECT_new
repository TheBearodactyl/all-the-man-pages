ASN1_OBJECT_NEW(3ssl)                                                                             OpenSSL                                                                            ASN1_OBJECT_NEW(3ssl)

NAME
       ASN1_OBJECT_new, ASN1_OBJECT_free - object allocation functions

SYNOPSIS
        #include <openssl/asn1.h>

        ASN1_OBJECT *ASN1_OBJECT_new(void);
        void ASN1_OBJECT_free(ASN1_OBJECT *a);

DESCRIPTION
       The ASN1_OBJECT allocation routines, allocate and free an ASN1_OBJECT structure, which represents an ASN1 OBJECT IDENTIFIER.

       ASN1_OBJECT_new() allocates and initializes an ASN1_OBJECT structure.

       ASN1_OBJECT_free() frees up the ASN1_OBJECT structure a.  If a is NULL, nothing is done.

NOTES
       Although ASN1_OBJECT_new() allocates a new ASN1_OBJECT structure it is almost never used in applications. The ASN1 object utility functions such as OBJ_nid2obj() are used instead.

RETURN VALUES
       If the allocation fails, ASN1_OBJECT_new() returns NULL and sets an error code that can be obtained by ERR_get_error(3).  Otherwise it returns a pointer to the newly allocated structure.

       ASN1_OBJECT_free() returns no value.
