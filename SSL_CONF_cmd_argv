SSL_CONF_CMD_ARGV(3ssl)             OpenSSL            SSL_CONF_CMD_ARGV(3ssl)

NAME
       SSL_CONF_cmd_argv - SSL configuration command line processing

SYNOPSIS
        #include <openssl/ssl.h>

        int SSL_CONF_cmd_argv(SSL_CONF_CTX *cctx, int *pargc, char ***pargv);

DESCRIPTION
       The function SSL_CONF_cmd_argv() processes at most two command line
       arguments from pargv and pargc. The values of pargv and pargc are
       updated to reflect the number of command options processed. The pargc
       argument can be set to NULL if it is not used.

RETURN VALUES
       SSL_CONF_cmd_argv() returns the number of command arguments processed:
       0, 1, 2 or a negative error code.

       If -2 is returned then an argument for a command is missing.

       If -1 is returned the command is recognised but couldn't be processed
       due to an error: for example a syntax error in the argument.
