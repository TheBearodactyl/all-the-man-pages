NAME
       ares_parse_srv_reply - Parse a reply to a DNS query of type SRV

SYNOPSIS
       #include <ares.h>

       int ares_parse_srv_reply(const unsigned char* abuf, int alen,
                                struct ares_srv_reply** srv_out);

DESCRIPTION
       The  ares_parse_srv_reply  function parses the response to a query of type SRV into a linked list of struct ares_srv_reply The parameters abuf and alen give the contents of the response.  The re‚Äê
       sult is stored in allocated memory and a pointer to it stored into the variable pointed to by srv_out.  It is the caller's responsibility to free the resulting srv_out structure  when  it  is  no
       longer needed using the function ares_free_data

       The structure ares_srv_reply contains the following fields:

           struct ares_srv_reply {
               struct ares_srv_reply  *next;
               unsigned short weight;
               unsigned short priority;
               unsigned short port;
               char *host;
           };

RETURN VALUES
       ares_parse_srv_reply can return any of the following values:

       ARES_SUCCESS   The response was successfully parsed.

       ARES_EBADRESP  The response was malformatted.

       ARES_ENODATA   The response did not contain an answer to the query.

       ARES_ENOMEM    Memory was exhausted.
