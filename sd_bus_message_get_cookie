NAME
       sd_bus_message_get_cookie, sd_bus_message_get_reply_cookie - Returns
       the transaction cookie of a message

SYNOPSIS
       #include <systemd/sd-bus.h>

       int sd_bus_message_get_cookie(sd_bus_message *message,
                                     uint64_t *cookie);

       int sd_bus_message_get_reply_cookie(sd_bus_message *message,
                                           uint64_t *cookie);

DESCRIPTION
       sd_bus_message_get_cookie() returns the transaction cookie of a
       message. The cookie uniquely identifies a message within each bus peer,
       but is not globally unique. It is assigned when a message is sent.

       sd_bus_message_get_reply_cookie() returns the transaction cookie of the
       message the specified message is a response to. When a reply message is
       generated for a method call message, its cookie is copied over into
       this field. Note that while every message that is transferred is
       identified by a cookie, only response messages carry a reply cookie
       field.

       Both functions take a message object as first parameter and a place to
       store the 64-bit cookie in.

RETURN VALUE
       On success, these calls return 0 or a positive integer. On failure,
       they return a negative errno-style error code.

       On success, the cookie/reply cookie is returned in the specified 64-bit
       unsigned integer variable.

   Errors
       Returned errors may indicate the following problems:

       -EINVAL
           A specified parameter is invalid.

       -ENODATA
           No cookie has been assigned to this message. This either indicates
           that the message has not been sent yet and hence has no cookie
           assigned, or that the message is not a method response message and
           hence carries a reply cookie field.

NOTES
       These APIs are implemented as a shared library, which can be compiled
       and linked to with the libsystemd pkg-config(1) file.
