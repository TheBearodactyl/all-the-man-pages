NAME
       EVP_md5, EVP_md5_sha1 - MD5 For EVP

SYNOPSIS
        #include <openssl/evp.h>

        const EVP_MD *EVP_md5(void);
        const EVP_MD *EVP_md5_sha1(void);

DESCRIPTION
       MD5 is a cryptographic hash function standardized in RFC 1321 and designed by Ronald Rivest.

       The CMU Software Engineering Institute considers MD5 unsuitable for further use since its security has been severely compromised.

       EVP_md5()
           The MD5 algorithm which produces a 128-bit output from a given input.

       EVP_md5_sha1()
           A hash algorithm of SSL v3 that combines MD5 with SHA-1 as described in RFC 6101.

           WARNING: this algorithm is not intended for non-SSL usage.

RETURN VALUES
       These functions return a EVP_MD structure that contains the implementation of the message digest. See EVP_MD_meth_new(3) for details of the EVP_MD structure.

CONFORMING TO
       IETF RFC 1321.
