NAME
       CURLOPT_READDATA - pointer passed to the read callback

SYNOPSIS
       #include <curl/curl.h>

       CURLcode curl_easy_setopt(CURL *handle, CURLOPT_READDATA, void *pointer);

DESCRIPTION
       Data pointer to pass to the file read function. If you use the CURLOPT_READFUNCTION(3) option, this is the pointer you will get as input in the fourth argument to the callback.

       If you do not specify a read callback but instead rely on the default internal read function, this data must be a valid readable FILE * (cast to 'void *').

       If you are using libcurl as a win32 DLL, you MUST use a CURLOPT_READFUNCTION(3) if you set this option or you will experience crashes.

DEFAULT
       By default, this is a FILE * to stdin.

PROTOCOLS
       This is used for all protocols when sending data.

EXAMPLE
       CURL *curl = curl_easy_init();
       struct MyData this;
       if(curl) {
         curl_easy_setopt(curl, CURLOPT_URL, "https://example.com");

         /* pass pointer that gets passed in to the
            CURLOPT_READFUNCTION callback */
         curl_easy_setopt(curl, CURLOPT_READDATA, &this);

         curl_easy_perform(curl);
       }

AVAILABILITY
       This option was once known by the older name CURLOPT_INFILE, the name CURLOPT_READDATA(3) was introduced in 7.9.7.

RETURN VALUE
       This will return CURLE_OK.
