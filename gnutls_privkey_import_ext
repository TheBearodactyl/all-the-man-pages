NAME
       gnutls_privkey_import_ext - API function

SYNOPSIS
       #include <gnutls/abstract.h>

       int gnutls_privkey_import_ext(gnutls_privkey_t pkey, gnutls_pk_algorithm_t pk, void * userdata, gnutls_privkey_sign_func sign_func, gnutls_privkey_decrypt_func decrypt_func, unsigned int flags);

ARGUMENTS
       gnutls_privkey_t pkey
                   The private key

       gnutls_pk_algorithm_t pk
                   The public key algorithm

       void * userdata
                   private data to be provided to the callbacks

       gnutls_privkey_sign_func sign_func
                   callback for signature operations

       gnutls_privkey_decrypt_func decrypt_func
                   callback for decryption operations

       unsigned int flags
                   Flags for the import

DESCRIPTION
       This function will associate the given callbacks with the gnutls_privkey_t type. At least one of the two callbacks must be non-null.

       Note  that the signing function is supposed to "raw" sign data, i.e., without any hashing or preprocessing. In case of RSA the DigestInfo will be provided, and the signing function is expected to
       do the PKCS 1 1.5 padding and the exponentiation.

       See also gnutls_privkey_import_ext3().

RETURNS
       On success, GNUTLS_E_SUCCESS (0) is returned, otherwise a negative error value.

SINCE
       3.0
