NAME
     zip_get_archive_comment â€” get zip archive comment

LIBRARY
     libzip (-lzip)

SYNOPSIS
     #include <zip.h>

     const char *
     zip_get_archive_comment(zip_t *archive, int *lenp, zip_flags_t flags);

DESCRIPTION
     The zip_get_archive_comment() function returns the comment for the entire zip archive.  The return value is in UTF-8 encoding unless ZIP_FL_ENC_RAW was specified (see below).  This pointer should
     not be modified or free(3)'d, and becomes invalid when archive is closed.  If lenp is not NULL, the integer to which it points will be set to the length of the comment.  If flags is set to
     ZIP_FL_UNCHANGED, the original unchanged comment is returned.

     Additionally, the following flags are supported:

           ZIP_FL_ENC_RAW       Return the unmodified archive comment as it is in the ZIP archive.

           ZIP_FL_ENC_GUESS     (Default.)  Guess the encoding of the archive comment in the ZIP archive and convert it to UTF-8, if necessary.  (Only CP-437 and UTF-8 are recognized.)

           ZIP_FL_ENC_STRICT    Follow the ZIP specification for file names and extend it to the archive comment, thus also expecting it in CP-437 encoding.  Convert it to UTF-8.
     Note: ASCII is a subset of both CP-437 and UTF-8.

RETURN VALUES
     Upon successful completion, a pointer to the comment is returned, or NULL if there is no comment.

HISTORY
     zip_get_archive_comment() was added in libzip 0.7.  In libzip 0.11 the type of flags was changed from int to zip_flags_t.
