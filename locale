NAME
       locale - get locale-specific information

SYNOPSIS
       locale [option]
       locale [option] -a
       locale [option] -m
       locale [option] name...

DESCRIPTION
       The locale command displays information about the current locale, or all locales, on standard output.

       When  invoked  without  arguments, locale displays the current locale settings for each locale category (see locale(5)), based on the settings of the environment variables that control the locale
       (see locale(7)).  Values for variables set in the environment are printed without double quotes, implied values are printed with double quotes.

       If either the -a or the -m option (or one of their long-format equivalents) is specified, the behavior is as follows:

       -a, --all-locales
              Display a list of all available locales.  The -v option causes the LC_IDENTIFICATION metadata about each locale to be included in the output.

       -m, --charmaps
              Display the available charmaps (character set description files).  To display the current character set for the locale, use locale -c charmap.

       The locale command can also be provided with one or more arguments, which are the names of locale keywords (for example, date_fmt, ctype-class-names, yesexpr, or decimal_point)  or  locale  cate‐
       gories (for example, LC_CTYPE or LC_TIME).  For each argument, the following is displayed:

       •  For a locale keyword, the value of that keyword to be displayed.

       •  For a locale category, the values of all keywords in that category are displayed.

       When arguments are supplied, the following options are meaningful:

       -c, --category-name
              For a category name argument, write the name of the locale category on a separate line preceding the list of keyword values for that category.

              For a keyword name argument, write the name of the locale category for this keyword on a separate line preceding the keyword value.

              This option improves readability when multiple name arguments are specified.  It can be combined with the -k option.

       -k, --keyword-name
              For each keyword whose value is being displayed, include also the name of that keyword, so that the output has the format:

                  keyword="value"

       The locale command also knows about the following options:

       -v, --verbose
              Display additional information for some command-line option and argument combinations.

       -?, --help
              Display a summary of command-line options and arguments and exit.

       --usage
              Display a short usage message and exit.

       -V, --version
              Display the program version and exit.

FILES
       /usr/lib/locale/locale-archive
              Usual default locale archive location.

       /usr/share/i18n/locales
              Usual default path for locale definition files.

STANDARDS
       POSIX.1-2008.

HISTORY
       POSIX.1-2001.

EXAMPLES
       $ locale
       LANG=en_US.UTF-8
       LC_CTYPE="en_US.UTF-8"
       LC_NUMERIC="en_US.UTF-8"
       LC_TIME="en_US.UTF-8"
       LC_COLLATE="en_US.UTF-8"
       LC_MONETARY="en_US.UTF-8"

       LC_PAPER="en_US.UTF-8"
       LC_NAME="en_US.UTF-8"
       LC_ADDRESS="en_US.UTF-8"
       LC_TELEPHONE="en_US.UTF-8"
       LC_MEASUREMENT="en_US.UTF-8"
       LC_IDENTIFICATION="en_US.UTF-8"
       LC_ALL=

       $ locale date_fmt
       %a %b %e %H:%M:%S %Z %Y

       $ locale -k date_fmt
       date_fmt="%a %b %e %H:%M:%S %Z %Y"

       $ locale -ck date_fmt
       LC_TIME
       date_fmt="%a %b %e %H:%M:%S %Z %Y"

       $ locale LC_TELEPHONE
       +%c (%a) %l
       (%a) %l
       11
       1
       UTF-8

       $ locale -k LC_TELEPHONE
       tel_int_fmt="+%c (%a) %l"
       tel_dom_fmt="(%a) %l"
       int_select="11"
       int_prefix="1"
       telephone-codeset="UTF-8"

       The  following  example compiles a custom locale from the ./wrk directory with the localedef(1) utility under the $HOME/.locale directory, then tests the result with the date(1) command, and then
       sets the environment variables LOCPATH and LANG in the shell profile file so that the custom locale will be used in the subsequent user sessions:

       $ mkdir -p $HOME/.locale
       $ I18NPATH=./wrk/ localedef -f UTF-8 -i fi_SE $HOME/.locale/fi_SE.UTF-8
       $ LOCPATH=$HOME/.locale LC_ALL=fi_SE.UTF-8 date
       $ echo "export LOCPATH=\$HOME/.locale" >> $HOME/.bashrc
       $ echo "export LANG=fi_SE.UTF-8" >> $HOME/.bashrc

NAME
       locale — get locale-specific information

SYNOPSIS
       locale [-a|-m]

       locale [-ck] name...

DESCRIPTION
       The locale utility shall write information about the current locale environment, or all public locales, to the standard output. For the purposes of this section, a public locale is  one  provided
       by the implementation that is accessible to the application.

       When  locale is invoked without any arguments, it shall summarize the current locale environment for each locale category as determined by the settings of the environment variables defined in the
       Base Definitions volume of POSIX.1‐2017, Chapter 7, Locale.

       When invoked with operands, it shall write values that have been assigned to the keywords in the locale categories, as follows:

        *  Specifying a keyword name shall select the named keyword and the category containing that keyword.

        *  Specifying a category name shall select the named category and all keywords in that category.

OPTIONS
       The locale utility shall conform to the Base Definitions volume of POSIX.1‐2017, Section 12.2, Utility Syntax Guidelines.

       The following options shall be supported:

       -a        Write information about all available public locales. The available locales shall include POSIX, representing the POSIX locale. The manner in which the  implementation  determines  what
                 other locales are available is implementation-defined.

       -c        Write  the names of selected locale categories; see the STDOUT section.  The -c option increases readability when more than one category is selected (for example, via more than one key‐
                 word name or via a category name).  It is valid both with and without the -k option.

       -k        Write the names and values of selected keywords. The implementation may omit values for some keywords; see the OPERANDS section.

       -m        Write names of available charmaps; see the Base Definitions volume of POSIX.1‐2017, Section 6.1, Portable Character Set.

OPERANDS
       The following operand shall be supported:

       name      The name of a locale category as defined in the Base Definitions volume of POSIX.1‐2017, Chapter 7, Locale, the name of a keyword in a locale category, or  the  reserved  name  charmap.
                 The  named  category  or keyword shall be selected for output. If a single name represents both a locale category name and a keyword name in the current locale, the results are unspeci‐
                 fied. Otherwise, both category and keyword names can be specified as name operands, in any sequence. It is implementation-defined whether any keyword values are written  for  the  cate‐
                 gories LC_CTYPE and LC_COLLATE.

STDIN
       Not used.

INPUT FILES
       None.

ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
       The following environment variables shall affect the execution of locale:

       LANG      Provide  a default value for the internationalization variables that are unset or null. (See the Base Definitions volume of POSIX.1‐2017, Section 8.2, Internationalization Variables for
                 the precedence of internationalization variables used to determine the values of locale categories.)

       LC_ALL    If set to a non-empty string value, override the values of all the other internationalization variables.

       LC_CTYPE  Determine the locale for the interpretation of sequences of bytes of text data as characters (for example, single-byte as opposed to multi-byte characters in arguments and input files).

       LC_MESSAGES
                 Determine the locale that should be used to affect the format and contents of diagnostic messages written to standard error.

       NLSPATH   Determine the location of message catalogs for the processing of LC_MESSAGES.

       The application shall ensure that the LANG, LC_*, and NLSPATH environment variables specify the current locale environment to be written out; they shall be used if the -a option is not specified.

ASYNCHRONOUS EVENTS
       Default.

STDOUT
       The LANG variable shall be written first using the format:

           "LANG=%s\n", <value>

       If LANG is not set or is an empty string, the value is the empty string.

       If locale is invoked without any options or operands, the names and values of the LC_* environment variables described in this volume of POSIX.1‐2017 shall be written to the standard output,  one
       variable per line, and each line using the following format. Only those variables set in the environment and not overridden by LC_ALL shall be written using this format:

           "%s=%s\n", <variable_name>, <value>

       The  names of those LC_* variables associated with locale categories defined in this volume of POSIX.1‐2017 that are not set in the environment or are overridden by LC_ALL shall be written in the
       following format:

           "%s=\"%s\"\n", <variable_name>, <implied value>

       The <implied value> shall be the name of the locale that has been selected for that category by the implementation, based on the values in LANG and LC_ALL, as described in  the  Base  Definitions
       volume of POSIX.1‐2017, Chapter 8, Environment Variables.

       The  <value> and <implied value> shown above shall be properly quoted for possible later reentry to the shell. The <value> shall not be quoted using double-quotes (so that it can be distinguished
       by the user from the <implied value> case, which always requires double-quotes).

       The LC_ALL variable shall be written last, using the first format shown above. If it is not set, it shall be written as:

           "LC_ALL=\n"

       If any arguments are specified:

        1. If the -a option is specified, the names of all the public locales shall be written, each in the following format:

               "%s\n", <locale name>

        2. If the -c option is specified, the names of all selected categories shall be written, each in the following format:

               "%s\n", <category name>

           If keywords are also selected for writing (see following items), the category name output shall precede the keyword output for that category.

           If the -c option is not specified, the names of the categories shall not be written; only the keywords, as selected by the <name> operand, shall be written.

        3. If the -k option is specified, the names and values of selected keywords shall be written. If a value is non-numeric and is not a compound keyword value, it shall be written in the  following
           format:

               "%s=\"%s\"\n", <keyword name>, <keyword value>

           If a value is a non-numeric compound keyword value, it shall either be written in the format:

               "%s=\"%s\"\n", <keyword name>, <keyword value>

           where the <keyword value> is a single string of values separated by <semicolon> characters, or it shall be written in the format:

               "%s=%s\n", <keyword name>, <keyword value>

           where the <keyword value> is encoded as a set of strings, each enclosed in double-quotation-marks, separated by <semicolon> characters.

           If  the  keyword  was  charmap,  the  name  of the charmap (if any) that was specified via the localedef -f option when the locale was created shall be written, with the word charmap as <key‐
           word name>.

           If a value is numeric, it shall be written in one of the following formats:

               "%s=%d\n", <keyword name>, <keyword value>

               "%s=%c%o\n", <keyword name>, <escape character>, <keyword value>

               "%s=%cx%x\n", <keyword name>, <escape character>, <keyword value>

           where the <escape character> is that identified by the escape_char keyword in the current locale; see the Base Definitions volume of POSIX.1‐2017, Section 7.3, Locale Definition.

           Compound keyword values (list entries) shall be separated in the output by <semicolon> characters. When included in keyword values, the <semicolon>, <backslash>, double-quote, and any control
           character shall be preceded (escaped) with the escape character.

        4. If the -k option is not specified, selected keyword values shall be written, each in the following format:

               "%s\n", <keyword value>

           If the keyword was charmap, the name of the charmap (if any) that was specified via the localedef -f option when the locale was created shall be written.

        5. If the -m option is specified, then a list of all available charmaps shall be written, each in the format:

               "%s\n", <charmap>

           where <charmap> is in a format suitable for use as the option-argument to the localedef -f option.

STDERR
       The standard error shall be used only for diagnostic messages.

OUTPUT FILES
       None.

EXTENDED DESCRIPTION
       None.

EXIT STATUS
       The following exit values shall be returned:

        0    All the requested information was found and output successfully.

       >0    An error occurred.

CONSEQUENCES OF ERRORS
       Default.

       The following sections are informative.

APPLICATION USAGE
       If the LANG environment variable is not set or set to an empty value, or one of the LC_* environment variables is set to an unrecognized value, the actual locales assumed (if any) are implementa‐
       tion-defined as described in the Base Definitions volume of POSIX.1‐2017, Chapter 8, Environment Variables.

       Implementations are not required to write out the actual values for keywords in the categories LC_CTYPE and LC_COLLATE; however, they must write out the categories (allowing an application to de‐
       termine, for example, which character classes are available).

EXAMPLES
       In the following examples, the assumption is that locale environment variables are set as follows:

           LANG=locale_x
           LC_COLLATE=locale_y

       The command locale would result in the following output:

           LANG=locale_x
           LC_CTYPE="locale_x"
           LC_COLLATE=locale_y
           LC_TIME="locale_x"
           LC_NUMERIC="locale_x"
           LC_MONETARY="locale_x"
           LC_MESSAGES="locale_x"
           LC_ALL=

       The order of presentation of the categories is not specified by this volume of POSIX.1‐2017.

       The command:

           LC_ALL=POSIX locale -ck decimal_point

       would produce:

           LC_NUMERIC
           decimal_point="."

       The following command shows an application of locale to determine whether a user-supplied response is affirmative:

           printf 'Prompt for response: '
           read response
           if printf "%s\n$response" | grep -- -Eq "$(locale yesexpr)"
           then
               affirmative processing goes here
           else
               non-affirmative processing goes here
           fi

RATIONALE
       The output for categories LC_CTYPE and LC_COLLATE has been made implementation-defined because there is a questionable value in having a shell script receive an entire array of characters.  It is
       also difficult to return a logical collation description, short of returning a complete localedef source.

       The -m option was included to allow applications to query for the existence of charmaps.  The output is a list of the charmaps (implementation-supplied and user-supplied, if any) on the system.

       The -c option was included for readability when more than one category is selected (for example, via more than one keyword name or via a category name). It is valid both with and without  the  -k
       option.

       The charmap keyword, which returns the name of the charmap (if any) that was used when the current locale was created, was included to allow applications needing the information to retrieve it.

       According  to  the  Base  Definitions  volume  of  POSIX.1‐2017, Section 6.1, Portable Character Set, the standard requires that all supported locales must have the same encoding for <period> and
       <slash>, because these two characters are used within the locale-independent pathname resolution sequence. Therefore, it would be an error if locale -a listed both ASCII and EBCDIC-based locales,
       since  those  two encodings do not share the same representation for either <period> or <slash>.  Any system that supports both environments would be expected to provide two POSIX locales, one in
       either codeset, where only the locales appropriate to the current environment can be visible at a time. In an XSI-compliant implementation, the dd utility is the only portable means for  perform‐
       ing conversions between the two character sets.

FUTURE DIRECTIONS
       None.

NAME
       locale - Perl pragma to use or avoid POSIX locales for built-in operations

WARNING
       DO NOT USE this pragma in scripts that have multiple threads active.  The locale is not local to a single thread.  Another thread may change the locale at any time, which could cause at a minimum
       that a given thread is operating in a locale it isn't expecting to be in.  On some platforms, segfaults can also occur.  The locale change need not be explicit; some operations cause perl to
       change the locale itself.  You are vulnerable simply by having done a "use locale".

SYNOPSIS
           @x = sort @y;      # Native-platform/Unicode code point sort order
           {
               use locale;
               @x = sort @y;  # Locale-defined sort order
           }
           @x = sort @y;      # Native-platform/Unicode code point sort order
                              # again

DESCRIPTION
       This pragma tells the compiler to enable (or disable) the use of POSIX locales for built-in operations (for example, LC_CTYPE for regular expressions, LC_COLLATE for string comparison, and
       LC_NUMERIC for number formatting).  Each "use locale" or "no locale" affects statements to the end of the enclosing BLOCK.

       See perllocale for more detailed information on how Perl supports locales.

       On systems that don't have locales, this pragma will cause your operations to behave as if in the "C" locale; attempts to change the locale will fail.

NAME
       locale - describes a locale definition file

DESCRIPTION
       The locale definition file contains all the information that the localedef(1) command needs to convert it into the binary locale database.

       The definition files consist of sections which each describe a locale category in detail.  See locale(7) for additional details for these categories.

   Syntax
       The locale definition file starts with a header that may consist of the following keywords:

       escape_char
              is  followed  by  a character that should be used as the escape-character for the rest of the file to mark characters that should be interpreted in a special way.  It defaults to the back‐
              slash (\).

       comment_char
              is followed by a character that will be used as the comment-character for the rest of the file.  It defaults to the number sign (#).

       The locale definition has one part for each locale category.  Each part can be copied from another existing locale or can be defined from scratch.  If the category  should  be  copied,  the  only
       valid  keyword  in the definition is copy followed by the name of the locale in double quotes which should be copied.  The exceptions for this rule are LC_COLLATE and LC_CTYPE where a copy state‐
       ment can be followed by locale-specific rules and selected overrides.

       When defining a locale or a category from scratch, an existing system- provided locale definition file should be used as a reference to follow common glibc conventions.

   Locale category sections
       The following category sections are defined by POSIX:

       •  LC_CTYPE

       •  LC_COLLATE

       •  LC_MESSAGES

       •  LC_MONETARY

       •  LC_NUMERIC

       abday  followed by a list of abbreviated names of the days of the week.  The list starts with the first day of the week as specified by week (Sunday by default).  See NOTES.

       day    followed by a list of names of the days of the week.  The list starts with the first day of the week as specified by week (Sunday by default).  See NOTES.

       abmon  followed by a list of abbreviated month names.

       mon    followed by a list of month names.

       d_t_fmt
              followed by the appropriate date and time format (for syntax, see strftime(3)).

       d_fmt  followed by the appropriate date format (for syntax, see strftime(3)).

       t_fmt  followed by the appropriate time format (for syntax, see strftime(3)).

       am_pm  followed by the appropriate representation of the am and pm strings.  This should be left empty for locales not using AM/PM convention.

       t_fmt_ampm
              followed by the appropriate time format (for syntax, see strftime(3)) when using 12h clock format.  This should be left empty for locales not using AM/PM convention.

       era    followed by semicolon-separated strings that define how years are counted and displayed for each era in the locale.  Each string has the following format:

              direction:offset:start_date:end_date:era_name:era_format

              The fields are to be defined as follows:

              direction
                  Either + or -.  + means the years closer to start_date have lower numbers than years closer to end_date.  - means the opposite.

              offset
                  The number of the year closest to start_date in the era, corresponding to the %Ey descriptor (see strptime(3)).

              start_date
                  The start of the era in the form of yyyy/mm/dd.  Years prior AD 1 are represented as negative numbers.

              end_date
                  The  end of the era in the form of yyyy/mm/dd, or one of the two special values of -* or +*.  -* means the ending date is the beginning of time.  +* means the ending date is the end of
                  time.

              era_name
                  The name of the era corresponding to the %EC descriptor (see strptime(3)).

              era_format
                  The format of the year in the era corresponding to the %EY descriptor (see strptime(3)).

       era_d_fmt
              followed by the format of the date in alternative era notation, corresponding to the %Ex descriptor (see strptime(3)).

       era_t_fmt
              followed by the format of the time in alternative era notation, corresponding to the %EX descriptor (see strptime(3)).

       era_d_t_fmt
              followed by the format of the date and time in alternative era notation, corresponding to the %Ec descriptor (see strptime(3)).

       alt_digits
              followed by the alternative digits used for date and time in the locale.

       week   followed by a list of three values separated by semicolons: The number of days in a week (by default 7), a date of beginning of the week (by default corresponds to Sunday), and the minimal
              length of the first week in year (by default 4).  Regarding the start of the week, 19971130 shall be used for Sunday and 19971201 shall be used for Monday.  See NOTES.

       first_weekday (since glibc 2.2)
              followed  by  the  number of the day from the day list to be shown as the first day of the week in calendar applications.  The default value of 1 corresponds to either Sunday or Monday de‐
              pending on the value of the second week list item.  See NOTES.

       first_workday (since glibc 2.2)
              followed by the number of the first working day from the day list.  The default value is 2.  See NOTES.

       cal_direction
              followed by a number value that indicates the direction for the display of calendar dates, as follows:

              1   Left-right from top.

              3   Right-left from top.

       date_fmt
              followed by the appropriate date representation for date(1) (for syntax, see strftime(3)).

       The LC_TIME definition ends with the string END LC_TIME.

FILES
       /usr/lib/locale/locale-archive
              Usual default locale archive location.

       /usr/share/i18n/locales
              Usual default path for locale definition files.

STANDARDS
       POSIX.2.

NOTES
       The collective GNU C library community wisdom regarding abday, day, week, first_weekday, and first_workday states at https://sourceware.org/glibc/wiki/Locales the following:

       •  The value of the second week list item specifies the base of the abday and day lists.

       •  first_weekday specifies the offset of the first day-of-week in the abday and day lists.

       •  For compatibility reasons, all glibc locales should set the value of the second week list item to 19971130 (Sunday) and base the abday and day lists appropriately, and  set  first_weekday  and
          first_workday to 1 or 2, depending on whether the week and work week actually starts on Sunday or Monday for the locale.

NAME
       locale - description of multilanguage support

SYNOPSIS
       #include <locale.h>

DESCRIPTION
       A  locale  is a set of language and cultural rules.  These cover aspects such as language for messages, different character sets, lexicographic conventions, and so on.  A program needs to be able
       to determine its locale and act accordingly to be portable to different cultures.

       The header <locale.h> declares data types, functions, and macros which are useful in this task.

       The functions it declares are setlocale(3) to set the current locale, and localeconv(3) to get information about number formatting.

       There are different categories for locale information a program might need; they are declared as macros.  Using them as the first argument to the setlocale(3) function, it is possible to set  one
       of these to the desired locale:

       LC_ADDRESS (GNU extension, since glibc 2.2)
              Change  settings  that describe the formats (e.g., postal addresses) used to describe locations and geography-related items.  Applications that need this information can use nl_langinfo(3)
              to retrieve nonstandard elements, such as _NL_ADDRESS_COUNTRY_NAME (country name, in the language of the locale) and _NL_ADDRESS_LANG_NAME (language name, in the language of  the  locale),
              which return strings such as "Deutschland" and "Deutsch" (for German-language locales).  (Other element names are listed in <langinfo.h>.)

       LC_COLLATE
              This  category  governs  the  collation rules used for sorting and regular expressions, including character equivalence classes and multicharacter collating elements.  This locale category
              changes the behavior of the functions strcoll(3) and strxfrm(3), which are used to compare strings in the local alphabet.  For example, the German sharp s is sorted as "ss".

       LC_CTYPE
              This category determines the interpretation of byte sequences as characters (e.g., single versus multibyte characters), character classifications (e.g., alphabetic or digit), and  the  be‐
              havior  of character classes.  On glibc systems, this category also determines the character transliteration rules for iconv(1) and iconv(3).  It changes the behavior of the character han‐
              dling and classification functions, such as isupper(3) and toupper(3), and the multibyte character functions such as mblen(3) or wctomb(3).

       LC_IDENTIFICATION (GNU extension, since glibc 2.2)
              Change settings that relate to the metadata for the locale.  Applications that need this information can use nl_langinfo(3) to retrieve nonstandard elements, such as _NL_IDENTIFICATION_TI‐
              TLE  (title of this locale document) and _NL_IDENTIFICATION_TERRITORY (geographical territory to which this locale document applies), which might return strings such as "English locale for
              the USA" and "USA".  (Other element names are listed in <langinfo.h>.)

       LC_MONETARY
              This category determines the formatting used for monetary-related numeric values.  This changes the information returned by localeconv(3), which  describes  the  way  numbers  are  usually
              printed, with details such as decimal point versus decimal comma.  This information is internally used by the function strfmon(3).

       LC_MESSAGES
              This  category  affects the language in which messages are displayed and what an affirmative or negative answer looks like.  The GNU C library contains the gettext(3), ngettext(3), and rp‐
              match(3) functions to ease the use of this information.  The GNU gettext family of functions also obey the environment variable LANGUAGE (containing a colon-separated list of  locales)  if
              the category is set to a valid locale other than "C".  This category also affects the behavior of catopen(3).

       LC_MEASUREMENT (GNU extension, since glibc 2.2)
              Change the settings relating to the measurement system in the locale (i.e., metric versus US customary units).  Applications can use nl_langinfo(3) to retrieve the nonstandard _NL_MEASURE‐
              MENT_MEASUREMENT element, which returns a pointer to a character that has the value 1 (metric) or 2 (US customary units).

       LC_NAME (GNU extension, since glibc 2.2)
              Change settings that describe the formats used to  address  persons.   Applications  that  need  this  information  can  use  nl_langinfo(3)  to  retrieve  nonstandard  elements,  such  as
              _NL_NAME_NAME_MR  (general  salutation  for men) and _NL_NAME_NAME_MS (general salutation for women) elements, which return strings such as "Herr" and "Frau" (for German-language locales).
              (Other element names are listed in <langinfo.h>.)

       LC_NUMERIC
              This category determines the formatting rules used for nonmonetary numeric values—for example, the thousands separator and the radix character (a period in most English-speaking countries,
              but a comma in many other regions).  It affects functions such as printf(3), scanf(3), and strtod(3).  This information can also be read with the localeconv(3) function.

       LC_PAPER (GNU extension, since glibc 2.2)
              Change the settings relating to the dimensions of the standard paper size (e.g., US letter versus A4).  Applications that need the dimensions can obtain them by using nl_langinfo(3) to re‐
              trieve the nonstandard _NL_PAPER_WIDTH and _NL_PAPER_HEIGHT elements, which return int values specifying the dimensions in millimeters.

       LC_TELEPHONE (GNU extension, since glibc 2.2)
              Change settings that describe the formats to be used with telephone services.  Applications that need this information can use nl_langinfo(3) to  retrieve  nonstandard  elements,  such  as
              _NL_TELEPHONE_INT_PREFIX (international prefix used to call numbers in this locale), which returns a string such as "49" (for Germany).  (Other element names are listed in <langinfo.h>.)

       LC_TIME
              This  category  governs  the formatting used for date and time values.  For example, most of Europe uses a 24-hour clock versus the 12-hour clock used in the United States.  The setting of
              this category affects the behavior of functions such as strftime(3) and strptime(3).

       LC_ALL All of the above.

       If the second argument to setlocale(3) is an empty string, "", for the default locale, it is determined using the following steps:

       (1)  If there is a non-null environment variable LC_ALL, the value of LC_ALL is used.

       (2)  If an environment variable with the same name as one of the categories above exists and is non-null, its value is used for that category.

       (3)  If there is a non-null environment variable LANG, the value of LANG is used.

       Values about local numeric formatting is made available in a struct lconv returned by the localeconv(3) function, which has the following declaration:

           struct lconv {

               /* Numeric (nonmonetary) information */

               char *decimal_point;     /* Radix character */
               char *thousands_sep;     /* Separator for digit groups to left
                                           of radix character */
               char *grouping;     /* Each element is the number of digits in
                                      a group; elements with higher indices
                                      are further left.  An element with value
                                      CHAR_MAX means that no further grouping
                                      is done.  An element with value 0 means
                                      that the previous element is used for
                                      all groups further left. */

               /* Remaining fields are for monetary information */

               char *int_curr_symbol;   /* First three chars are a currency
                                           symbol from ISO 4217.  Fourth char
                                           is the separator.  Fifth char
                                           is '\0'. */
               char *currency_symbol;   /* Local currency symbol */
               char *mon_decimal_point; /* Radix character */
               char *mon_thousands_sep; /* Like thousands_sep above */
               char *mon_grouping;      /* Like grouping above */
               char *positive_sign;     /* Sign for positive values */
               char *negative_sign;     /* Sign for negative values */
               char  int_frac_digits;   /* International fractional digits */
               char  frac_digits;       /* Local fractional digits */
               char  p_cs_precedes;     /* 1 if currency_symbol precedes a
                                           positive value, 0 if succeeds */
               char  p_sep_by_space;    /* 1 if a space separates

               char  n_cs_precedes;     /* 1 if currency_symbol precedes a
                                           negative value, 0 if succeeds */
               char  n_sep_by_space;    /* 1 if a space separates
                                           currency_symbol from a negative
                                           value */
               /* Positive and negative sign positions:
                  0 Parentheses surround the quantity and currency_symbol.
                  1 The sign string precedes the quantity and currency_symbol.
                  2 The sign string succeeds the quantity and currency_symbol.
                  3 The sign string immediately precedes the currency_symbol.
                  4 The sign string immediately succeeds the currency_symbol. */
               char  p_sign_posn;
               char  n_sign_posn;
           };

   POSIX.1-2008 extensions to the locale API
       POSIX.1-2008 standardized a number of extensions to the locale API, based on implementations that first appeared in glibc 2.3.  These extensions are designed to address the problem that the  tra‐
       ditional locale APIs do not mix well with multithreaded applications and with applications that must deal with multiple locales.

       The extensions take the form of new functions for creating and manipulating locale objects (newlocale(3), freelocale(3), duplocale(3), and uselocale(3)) and various new library functions with the
       suffix "_l" (e.g., toupper_l(3)) that extend the traditional locale-dependent APIs (e.g., toupper(3)) to allow the specification of a locale object that should apply when executing the function.

ENVIRONMENT
       The following environment variable is used by newlocale(3) and setlocale(3), and thus affects all unprivileged localized programs:

       LOCPATH
              A list of pathnames, separated by colons (':'), that should be used to find locale data.  If this variable is set, only the individual compiled locale data files from LOCPATH and the  sys‐
              tem default locale data path are used; any available locale archives are not used (see localedef(1)).  The individual compiled locale data files are searched for under subdirectories which
              depend on the currently used locale.  For example, when en_GB.UTF-8 is used for a category, the following subdirectories are searched for, in this order:  en_GB.UTF-8,  en_GB.utf8,  en_GB,
              en.UTF-8, en.utf8, and en.

FILES
       /usr/lib/locale/locale-archive
              Usual default locale archive location.

       /usr/lib/locale
              Usual default path for compiled individual locale files.

STANDARDS
       POSIX.1-2001.
