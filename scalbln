NAME
       scalbn, scalbnf, scalbnl, scalbln, scalblnf, scalblnl - multiply float‐
       ing-point number by integral power of radix

LIBRARY
       Math library (libm, -lm)

SYNOPSIS
       #include <math.h>

       double scalbln(double x, long exp);
       float scalblnf(float x, long exp);
       long double scalblnl(long double x, long exp);

       double scalbn(double x, int exp);
       float scalbnf(float x, int exp);
       long double scalbnl(long double x, int exp);

   Feature Test Macro Requirements for glibc (see feature_test_macros(7)):

       scalbln(), scalblnf(), scalblnl():
           _ISOC99_SOURCE || _POSIX_C_SOURCE >= 200112L

       scalbn(), scalbnf(), scalbnl():
           _ISOC99_SOURCE || _POSIX_C_SOURCE >= 200112L
               || /* Since glibc 2.19: */ _DEFAULT_SOURCE
               || /* glibc <= 2.19: */ _BSD_SOURCE || _SVID_SOURCE

DESCRIPTION
       These functions multiply their first argument x by FLT_RADIX  (probably
       2) to the power of exp, that is:

           x * FLT_RADIX ** exp

       The definition of FLT_RADIX can be obtained by including <float.h>.

RETURN VALUE
       On success, these functions return x * FLT_RADIX ** exp.

       If x is a NaN, a NaN is returned.

       If x is positive infinity (negative infinity), positive infinity (nega‐
       tive infinity) is returned.

       If x is +0 (-0), +0 (-0) is returned.

       If the result overflows, a range error occurs, and the functions return
       HUGE_VAL,  HUGE_VALF,  or HUGE_VALL, respectively, with a sign the same
       as x.

       If the result underflows, a range error occurs, and the  functions  re‐
       turn zero, with a sign the same as x.

ERRORS
       See  math_error(7) for information on how to determine whether an error
       has occurred when calling these functions.

       The following errors can occur:

       Range error, overflow
              An overflow floating-point exception (FE_OVERFLOW) is raised.

       Range error, underflow
              errno is set to ERANGE.  An underflow  floating-point  exception
              (FE_UNDERFLOW) is raised.

STANDARDS
       C11, POSIX.1-2008.

HISTORY
       glibc 2.1.  C99, POSIX.1-2001.

HISTORY
       These  functions  differ  from  the  obsolete  functions  described  in
       scalb(3) in the type of their second argument.  The functions described
       on this page have a second argument of an integral type, while those in
       scalb(3) have a second argument of type double.

NOTES
       If FLT_RADIX equals 2 (which is usual), then scalbn() is equivalent  to
       ldexp(3).

BUGS
       Before glibc 2.20, these functions did not set errno for range errors.

PROLOG
       This  manual  page is part of the POSIX Programmer's Manual.  The Linux
       implementation of this interface may differ (consult the  corresponding
       Linux  manual page for details of Linux behavior), or the interface may
       not be implemented on Linux.

NAME
       scalbln, scalblnf, scalblnl, scalbn, scalbnf, scalbnl —  compute  expo‐
       nent using FLT_RADIX

SYNOPSIS
       #include <math.h>

       double scalbln(double x, long n);
       float scalblnf(float x, long n);
       long double scalblnl(long double x, long n);
       double scalbn(double x, int n);
       float scalbnf(float x, int n);
       long double scalbnl(long double x, int n);

DESCRIPTION
       The  functionality described on this reference page is aligned with the
       ISO C standard. Any conflict between the  requirements  described  here
       and  the  ISO C  standard is unintentional. This volume of POSIX.1‐2017
       defers to the ISO C standard.

       These functions shall compute x * FLT_RADIXn efficiently, not  normally
       by computing FLT_RADIXn explicitly.

       An  application  wishing to check for error situations should set errno
       to zero and  call  feclearexcept(FE_ALL_EXCEPT)  before  calling  these
       functions. On return, if errno is non-zero or fetestexcept(FE_INVALID |
       FE_DIVBYZERO | FE_OVERFLOW | FE_UNDERFLOW) is non-zero,  an  error  has
       occurred.

RETURN VALUE
       Upon    successful    completion,    these   functions   shall   return
       x * FLT_RADIXn.

       If the result would cause overflow, a range error shall occur and these
       functions shall return ±HUGE_VAL, ±HUGE_VALF, and ±HUGE_VALL (according
       to the sign of x) as appropriate for the return type of the function.

       If the correct value would cause underflow, and is not representable, a
       range error may occur, and scalbln(), scalblnf(), scalblnl(), scalbn(),
       scalbnf(), and scalbnl() shall return 0.0, or (if IEC  60559  Floating-
       Point  is  not supported) an implementation-defined value no greater in
       magnitude  than  DBL_MIN,  FLT_MIN,  LDBL_MIN,  DBL_MIN,  FLT_MIN,  and
       LDBL_MIN, respectively.

       If x is NaN, a NaN shall be returned.

       If x is ±0 or ±Inf, x shall be returned.

       If n is 0, x shall be returned.

       If  the  correct  value  would cause underflow, and is representable, a
       range error may occur and the correct value shall be returned.

ERRORS
       These functions shall fail if:

       Range Error The result overflows.

                   If the integer expression (math_errhandling  &  MATH_ERRNO)
                   is  non-zero,  then errno shall be set to [ERANGE].  If the
                   integer expression (math_errhandling &  MATH_ERREXCEPT)  is
                   non-zero,  then the overflow floating-point exception shall
                   be raised.

       These functions may fail if:

       Range Error The result underflows.

                   If the integer expression (math_errhandling  &  MATH_ERRNO)
                   is  non-zero,  then errno shall be set to [ERANGE].  If the
                   integer expression (math_errhandling &  MATH_ERREXCEPT)  is
                   non-zero, then the underflow floating-point exception shall
                   be raised.

       The following sections are informative.

EXAMPLES
       None.

APPLICATION USAGE
       On error, the expressions (math_errhandling & MATH_ERRNO) and (math_er‐
       rhandling & MATH_ERREXCEPT) are independent of each other, but at least
       one of them must be non-zero.

RATIONALE
       These functions are named so as to avoid conflicting with the  histori‐
       cal  definition of the scalb() function from the Single UNIX Specifica‐
       tion. The difference is that the scalb() function has a second argument
       of  double  instead  of  int.   The scalb() function is not part of the
       ISO C standard. The three functions whose second type is long are  pro‐
       vided  because  the factor required to scale from the smallest positive
       floating-point value to the largest finite  one,  on  many  implementa‐
       tions, is too large to represent in the minimum-width int format.

FUTURE DIRECTIONS
       None.
