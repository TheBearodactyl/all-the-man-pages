NAME
       xcb_poly_line - draw lines

SYNOPSIS
       #include <xcb/xproto.h>

   Request function
       xcb_void_cookie_t xcb_poly_line(xcb_connection_t *conn, uint8_t coordinate_mode, xcb_drawable_t drawable, xcb_gcontext_t gc, uint32_t points_len, const xcb_point_t *points);

REQUEST ARGUMENTS
       conn      The XCB connection to X11.

       coordinate_mode
                 One of the following values:

                 XCB_COORD_MODE_ORIGIN
                           Treats all coordinates as relative to the origin.

                 XCB_COORD_MODE_PREVIOUS
                           Treats all coordinates after the first as relative to the previous coordinate.

       drawable  The drawable to draw the line(s) on.

       gc        The graphics context to use.

       points_len
                 The number of xcb_point_t structures in points.

       points    An array of points.

DESCRIPTION
       Draws points_len-1 lines between each pair of points (point[i], point[i+1]) in the points array. The lines are drawn in the order listed in the array.  They join correctly at all intermediate
       points, and if the first and last points coincide, the first and last lines also join correctly. For any given line, a pixel is not drawn more than once. If thin (zero line-width) lines inter‚Äê
       sect, the intersecting pixels are drawn multiple times. If wide lines intersect, the intersecting pixels are drawn only once, as though the entire request were a single, filled shape.

RETURN VALUE
       Returns an xcb_void_cookie_t. Errors (if any) have to be handled in the event loop.

       If you want to handle errors directly with xcb_request_check instead, use xcb_poly_line_checked. See xcb-requests(3) for details.
