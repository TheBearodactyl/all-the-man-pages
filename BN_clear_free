BN_NEW(3ssl)                        OpenSSL                       BN_NEW(3ssl)

NAME
       BN_new, BN_secure_new, BN_clear, BN_free, BN_clear_free - allocate and
       free BIGNUMs

SYNOPSIS
        #include <openssl/bn.h>

        BIGNUM *BN_new(void);

        BIGNUM *BN_secure_new(void);

        void BN_clear(BIGNUM *a);

        void BN_free(BIGNUM *a);

        void BN_clear_free(BIGNUM *a);

DESCRIPTION
       BN_new() allocates and initializes a BIGNUM structure.  BN_secure_new()
       does the same except that the secure heap OPENSSL_secure_malloc(3) is
       used to store the value.

       BN_clear() is used to destroy sensitive data such as keys when they are
       no longer needed. It erases the memory used by a and sets it to the
       value 0.  If a is NULL, nothing is done.

       BN_free() frees the components of the BIGNUM, and if it was created by
       BN_new(), also the structure itself. BN_clear_free() additionally
       overwrites the data before the memory is returned to the system.  If a
       is NULL, nothing is done.

RETURN VALUES
       BN_new() and BN_secure_new() return a pointer to the BIGNUM initialised
       to the value 0.  If the allocation fails, they return NULL and set an
       error code that can be obtained by ERR_get_error(3).

       BN_clear(), BN_free() and BN_clear_free() have no return values.

HISTORY
       BN_init() was removed in OpenSSL 1.1.0; use BN_new() instead.
