NAME
       gnutls_prf_raw - API function

SYNOPSIS
       #include <gnutls/gnutls.h>

       int gnutls_prf_raw(gnutls_session_t session, size_t label_size, const char * label, size_t seed_size, const char * seed, size_t outsize, char * out);

ARGUMENTS
       gnutls_session_t session
                   is a gnutls_session_t type.

       size_t label_size
                   length of the  label variable.

       const char * label
                   label used in PRF computation, typically a short string.

       size_t seed_size
                   length of the  seed variable.

       const char * seed
                   optional extra data to seed the PRF with.

       size_t outsize
                   size of pre-allocated output buffer to hold the output.

       char * out  pre-allocated buffer to hold the generated data.

DESCRIPTION
       Apply the TLS Pseudo-Random-Function (PRF) on the master secret and the provided data.

       The   label variable usually contains a string denoting the purpose for the generated data.  The  seed usually contains data such as the client and server random, perhaps together with some addi‐
       tional data that is added to guarantee uniqueness of the output for a particular purpose.

       Because the output is not guaranteed to be unique for a particular session unless  seed includes the client random and server random fields (the PRF would output the same data on another  connec‐
       tion  resumed  from  the first one), it is not recommended to use this function directly.  The gnutls_prf() function seeds the PRF with the client and server random fields directly, and is recom‐
       mended if you want to generate pseudo random data unique for each session.

NOTE
       This function will only operate under TLS versions prior to 1.3.  In TLS1.3 the use of PRF is replaced with HKDF and the generic exporters like gnutls_prf_rfc5705() should be used instead.  Under
       TLS1.3 this function returns GNUTLS_E_INVALID_REQUEST.

RETURNS
       GNUTLS_E_SUCCESS on success, or an error code.
