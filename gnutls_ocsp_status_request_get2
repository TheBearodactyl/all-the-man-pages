NAME
       gnutls_ocsp_status_request_get2 - API function

SYNOPSIS
       #include <gnutls/gnutls.h>

       int gnutls_ocsp_status_request_get2(gnutls_session_t session, unsigned idx, gnutls_datum_t * response);

ARGUMENTS
       gnutls_session_t session
                   is a gnutls_session_t type.

       unsigned idx
                   the index of peer's certificate

       gnutls_datum_t * response
                   a gnutls_datum_t with DER encoded OCSP response

DESCRIPTION
       This function returns the OCSP status response received from the TLS server for the certificate index provided.  The index corresponds to certificates as returned by gnutls_certificate_get_peers.
       When index is zero this function operates identically to gnutls_ocsp_status_request_get().

       The returned  response should be treated as constant. If no OCSP response is available for the given index then GNUTLS_E_REQUESTED_DATA_NOT_AVAILABLE is returned.

RETURNS
       On success, GNUTLS_E_SUCCESS (0) is returned, otherwise a negative error code is returned.

SINCE
       3.6.3
