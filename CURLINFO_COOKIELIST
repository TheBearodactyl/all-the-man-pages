CURLINFO_COOKIELIST(3)                                                                   curl_easy_getinfo options                                                                  CURLINFO_COOKIELIST(3)

NAME
       CURLINFO_COOKIELIST - get all known cookies

SYNOPSIS
       #include <curl/curl.h>

       CURLcode curl_easy_getinfo(CURL *handle, CURLINFO_COOKIELIST,
                                  struct curl_slist **cookies);

DESCRIPTION
       Pass  a pointer to a 'struct curl_slist *' to receive a linked-list of all cookies curl knows (expired ones, too). do not forget to call curl_slist_free_all(3) on the list after it has been used.
       If there are no cookies (cookies for the handle have not been enabled or simply none have been received) 'struct curl_slist *' will be set to point to NULL.

       Since 7.43.0 cookies that were imported in the Set-Cookie format without a domain name are not exported by this option.

PROTOCOLS
       HTTP(S)

EXAMPLE
       CURL *curl = curl_easy_init();
       if(curl) {
         curl_easy_setopt(curl, CURLOPT_URL, "https://example.com");

         /* enable the cookie engine */
         curl_easy_setopt(curl, CURLOPT_COOKIEFILE, "");

         res = curl_easy_perform(curl);

         if(!res) {
           /* extract all known cookies */
           struct curl_slist *cookies = NULL;
           res = curl_easy_getinfo(curl, CURLINFO_COOKIELIST, &cookies);
           if(!res && cookies) {
             /* a linked list of cookies in cookie file format */
             struct curl_slist *each = cookies;
             while(each) {
               printf("%s\n", each->data);
               each = each->next;
             }
             /* we must free these cookies when we are done */
             curl_slist_free_all(cookies);
           }
         }
         curl_easy_cleanup(curl);
       }
