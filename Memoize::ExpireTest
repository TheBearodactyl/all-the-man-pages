NAME
       Memoize::ExpireTest - test for Memoize expiration semantics

DESCRIPTION
       This module is just for testing expiration semantics.  It's not a very good example of how to write an expiration module.

       If you are looking for an example, I recommend that you look at the simple example in the Memoize::Expire documentation, or at the code for Memoize::Expire itself.

       If you have questions, I will be happy to answer them if you send them to mjd-perl-memoize+@plover.com.
