NAME
     zip_file_set_encryption â€” set encryption method for file in zip

LIBRARY
     libzip (-lzip)

SYNOPSIS
     #include <zip.h>

     int
     zip_file_set_encryption(zip_t *archive, zip_uint64_t index, zip_uint16_t method, const char *password);

DESCRIPTION
     The zip_file_set_encryption() function sets the encryption method for the file at position index in the zip archive to method using the password password.  The method is the same as returned by
     zip_stat(3).  For the method argument, currently only the following values are supported:

     ZIP_EM_NONE        No encryption.

     ZIP_EM_AES_128     Winzip AES-128 encryption.

     ZIP_EM_AES_192     Winzip AES-192 encryption.

     ZIP_EM_AES_256     Winzip AES-256 encryption.

     ZIP_EM_TRAD_PKWARE
                        Traditional PKWare encryption.  Do not use this method, it is not secure.  It is only provided for backwards compatibility.

     If password is NULL, the default password provided by zip_set_default_password(3) is used.

     The current encryption method for a file in a zip archive can be determined using zip_stat(3).

RETURN VALUES
     Upon successful completion 0 is returned.  Otherwise, -1 is returned and the error information in archive is set to indicate the error.

ERRORS
     zip_file_set_encryption() fails if:

     [ZIP_ER_ENCRNOTSUPP]
                        Unsupported compression method requested.

     [ZIP_ER_INVAL]     index is not a valid file index in archive, or the argument combination is invalid.

     [ZIP_ER_MEMORY]    Required memory could not be allocated.

     [ZIP_ER_RDONLY]    Read-only zip file, no changes allowed.
