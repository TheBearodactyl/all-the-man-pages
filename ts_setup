NAME
       ts_setup - find, open and configure a touch screen input device

SYNOPSIS
       #include <tslib.h>

       struct tsdev *ts_setup(const char *dev_name, int nonblock);

DESCRIPTION
       ts_setup()  will try to find, open and configure the touch screen device.  On success it allocates memory for a new touch screen device, opens and links the input event device to it and loads and
       initialises all modules configured in the tslib configuration file TSLIB_CONFFILE.

       If dev_name is NULL ts_setup() will use the device defined by the TSLIB_TSDEVICE environment variable.

       If TSLIB_TSDEVICE is not defined ts_setup() will try to use following devices:
              /dev/input/ts,
              /dev/input/touchscreen,
              /dev/touchscreen/ucb1x00.
       After that we ts_setup() scans /dev/input/event* for the first device with property INPUT_PROP_DIRECT.

RETURN VALUE
       A pointer to the opened struct tsdev is returned.
