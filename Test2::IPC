NAME
       Test2::IPC - Turn on IPC for threading or forking support.

SYNOPSIS
       You should "use Test2::IPC;" as early as possible in your test file. If you import this module after API initialization it will attempt to retrofit IPC onto the existing hubs.

   DISABLING IT
       You can use "no Test2::IPC;" to disable IPC for good. You can also use the T2_NO_IPC env var.

EXPORTS
       All exports are optional.

       cull()
           Cull allows you to collect results from other processes or threads on demand.
