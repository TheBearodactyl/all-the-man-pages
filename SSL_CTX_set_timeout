SSL_CTX_SET_TIMEOUT(3ssl)           OpenSSL          SSL_CTX_SET_TIMEOUT(3ssl)

NAME
       SSL_CTX_set_timeout, SSL_CTX_get_timeout - manipulate timeout values
       for session caching

SYNOPSIS
        #include <openssl/ssl.h>

        long SSL_CTX_set_timeout(SSL_CTX *ctx, long t);
        long SSL_CTX_get_timeout(SSL_CTX *ctx);

DESCRIPTION
       SSL_CTX_set_timeout() sets the timeout for newly created sessions for
       ctx to t. The timeout value t must be given in seconds.

       SSL_CTX_get_timeout() returns the currently set timeout value for ctx.

NOTES
       Whenever a new session is created, it is assigned a maximum lifetime.
       This lifetime is specified by storing the creation time of the session
       and the timeout value valid at this time. If the actual time is later
       than creation time plus timeout, the session is not reused.

       Due to this realization, all sessions behave according to the timeout
       value valid at the time of the session negotiation. Changes of the
       timeout value do not affect already established sessions.

       The expiration time of a single session can be modified using the
       SSL_SESSION_get_time(3) family of functions.

       Expired sessions are removed from the internal session cache, whenever
       SSL_CTX_flush_sessions(3) is called, either directly by the application
       or automatically (see SSL_CTX_set_session_cache_mode(3))

       The default value for session timeout is decided on a per protocol
       basis, see SSL_get_default_timeout(3).  All currently supported
       protocols have the same default timeout value of 300 seconds.

       This timeout value is used as the ticket lifetime hint for stateless
       session tickets. It is also used as the timeout value within the ticket
       itself.

       For TLSv1.3, RFC8446 limits transmission of this value to 1 week
       (604800 seconds).

       For TLSv1.2, tickets generated during an initial handshake use the
       value as specified. Tickets generated during a resumed handshake have a
       value of 0 for the ticket lifetime hint.

RETURN VALUES
       SSL_CTX_set_timeout() returns the previously set timeout value.

       SSL_CTX_get_timeout() returns the currently set timeout value.
