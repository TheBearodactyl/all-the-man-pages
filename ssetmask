sgetmask(2)                   System Calls Manual                  sgetmask(2)

NAME
       sgetmask, ssetmask - manipulation of signal mask (obsolete)

LIBRARY
       Standard C library (libc, -lc)

SYNOPSIS
       #include <sys/syscall.h>      /* Definition of SYS_* constants */
       #include <unistd.h>

       [[deprecated]] long syscall(SYS_sgetmask, void);
       [[deprecated]] long syscall(SYS_ssetmask, long newmask);

DESCRIPTION
       These  system  calls are obsolete.  Do not use them; use sigprocmask(2)
       instead.

       sgetmask() returns the signal mask of the calling process.

       ssetmask() sets the signal mask of the calling  process  to  the  value
       given in newmask.  The previous signal mask is returned.

       The  signal  masks  dealt  with by these two system calls are plain bit
       masks (unlike the sigset_t used by sigprocmask(2)); use  sigmask(3)  to
       create and inspect these masks.

RETURN VALUE
       sgetmask() always successfully returns the signal mask.  ssetmask() al‐
       ways succeeds, and returns the previous signal mask.

ERRORS
       These system calls always succeed.

STANDARDS
       Linux.

HISTORY
       Since Linux 3.16, support for these system calls is optional, depending
       on  whether  the  kernel was built with the CONFIG_SGETMASK_SYSCALL op‐
       tion.

NOTES
       These system calls are unaware of signal numbers greater than 31 (i.e.,
       real-time signals).

       These system calls do not exist on x86-64.

       It is not possible to block SIGSTOP or SIGKILL.
