NAME
       XtVaCreateArgsList - dynamically allocate a varargs list

SYNTAX
       #include <X11/Intrinsic.h>

       XtVarArgsList XtVaCreateArgsList(XtPointer unused, ...);

ARGUMENTS
       unused    Must be specified as NULL.

       ...       Specifies a variable parameter list of resource name and value pairs.

DESCRIPTION
       The XtVaCreateArgsList function allocates memory and copies its arguments into a single list pointer, which may be used with XtVaNestedList.  The end of both lists is identified by a name entry
       containing NULL. Any entries of type XtVaTypedArg are copied as specified without applying conversions.  Data passed by reference (including Strings) are not copied, only the pointers themselves;
       the caller must ensure that the data remain valid for the lifetime of the created varargs list.  The list should be freed using XtFree when no longer needed.
