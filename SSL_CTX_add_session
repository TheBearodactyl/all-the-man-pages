SSL_CTX_ADD_SESSION(3ssl)           OpenSSL          SSL_CTX_ADD_SESSION(3ssl)

NAME
       SSL_CTX_add_session, SSL_CTX_remove_session - manipulate session cache

SYNOPSIS
        #include <openssl/ssl.h>

        int SSL_CTX_add_session(SSL_CTX *ctx, SSL_SESSION *c);

        int SSL_CTX_remove_session(SSL_CTX *ctx, SSL_SESSION *c);

DESCRIPTION
       SSL_CTX_add_session() adds the session c to the context ctx. The
       reference count for session c is incremented by 1. If a session with
       the same session id already exists, the old session is removed by
       calling SSL_SESSION_free(3).

       SSL_CTX_remove_session() removes the session c from the context ctx and
       marks it as non-resumable. SSL_SESSION_free(3) is called once for c.

NOTES
       When adding a new session to the internal session cache, it is examined
       whether a session with the same session id already exists. In this case
       it is assumed that both sessions are identical. If the same session is
       stored in a different SSL_SESSION object, The old session is removed
       and replaced by the new session. If the session is actually identical
       (the SSL_SESSION object is identical), SSL_CTX_add_session() is a no-
       op, and the return value is 0.

       If a server SSL_CTX is configured with the
       SSL_SESS_CACHE_NO_INTERNAL_STORE flag then the internal cache will not
       be populated automatically by new sessions negotiated by the SSL/TLS
       implementation, even though the internal cache will be searched
       automatically for session-resume requests (the latter can be suppressed
       by SSL_SESS_CACHE_NO_INTERNAL_LOOKUP). So the application can use
       SSL_CTX_add_session() directly to have full control over the sessions
       that can be resumed if desired.

RETURN VALUES
       The following values are returned by all functions:

       0   The operation failed. In case of the add operation, it was tried to
           add the same (identical) session twice. In case of the remove
           operation, the session was not found in the cache.

       1   The operation succeeded.
