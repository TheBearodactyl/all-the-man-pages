NAME
       XvGetStill - capture a single frame of video from a drawable

SYNOPSIS
       #include <X11/extensions/Xvlib.h>

       int XvGetStill(Display *dpy, XvPortID port, Drawable d, GC gc,
                      int vx, int vy, unsigned int vw, unsigned int vh,
                      int dx, int dy, unsigned int dw, unsigned int dh);

ARGUMENTS
       dpy            Specifies the connection to the X server.

       port           Defines the port to which the still is output.

       d              Defines the drawable from which the still is to be captured.  Pixmaps are currently not supported.

       gc             Defines the graphical context.  GC components are: subwindow-mode, clip-x-origin, clip-y-origin, and clip-mask.

       vx,vy,vw,vh    Define  the  location and size of the destination video region into which the still is to be written.  vx and vy define the xand y coordinates of the upper-left corner of the video
                      region; vwand vh define the width and height, in pixels, of the video region.

       dx,dy,dw,dh    Define the location and size of the source drawable from which the still image is to be captured.  dxand dy define the xand y coordinates of the upper-left corner of  the  drawable
                      region; dwand dh define the width and height, in pixels, of the drawable region.

DESCRIPTION
       captures  a  single frame of video from a drawable.  The position and size of the destination (video) rectangle is specified by vx, vy, vw, and vh.  The position and size of the source (drawable)
       rectangle is specified by dx, dy, dw, and dh.

       Drawable data is clipped to the bounds of the drawable, scaled to the requested video region size (or the closest size supported) and clipped to the bounds of the video encoding.  The contents of
       any region not updated with drawable data is undefined.

       If the port is grabbed by another client, this request is ignored, and an XvVideoNotify event with detail XvBusy is generated for the drawable.

RETURN VALUES
       [Success]
               Returned if XvGetStill(3) completed successfully.

       [XvBadExtension]
               Returned if the Xv extension is unavailable.

       [XvBadAlloc]
               Returned if XvGetStill(3) failed to allocate memory to process the request.

DIAGNOSTICS
       [XvBadPort]
               Generated if the requested port does not exist.

       [BadDrawable]
               Generated if the requested drawable does not exist.

       [BadGC] Generated if the requested graphics context does not exist.

       [BadAlloc]
               Generated if there were insufficient resources to process the request.
