CURLINFO_PRETRANSFER_TIME_T(3)                                                           curl_easy_getinfo options                                                          CURLINFO_PRETRANSFER_TIME_T(3)

NAME
       CURLINFO_PRETRANSFER_TIME_T - get the time until the file transfer start

SYNOPSIS
       #include <curl/curl.h>

       CURLcode curl_easy_getinfo(CURL *handle, CURLINFO_PRETRANSFER_TIME_T,
                                  curl_off_t *timep);

DESCRIPTION
       Pass  a  pointer  to a curl_off_t to receive the time, in microseconds, it took from the start until the file transfer is just about to begin. This includes all pre-transfer commands and negotia‚Äê
       tions that are specific to the particular protocol(s) involved. It does not involve the sending of the protocol- specific request that triggers a transfer.

       When a redirect is followed, the time from each request is added together.

       See also the TIMES overview in the curl_easy_getinfo(3) man page.

PROTOCOLS
       All

EXAMPLE
       curl = curl_easy_init();
       if(curl) {
         curl_off_t pretransfer;
         curl_easy_setopt(curl, CURLOPT_URL, url);
         res = curl_easy_perform(curl);
         if(CURLE_OK == res) {
           res = curl_easy_getinfo(curl, CURLINFO_PRETRANSFER_TIME_T, &pretransfer);
           if(CURLE_OK == res) {
             printf("Time: %" CURL_FORMAT_CURL_OFF_T ".%06ld", pretransfer / 1000000,
                    (long)(pretransfer % 1000000));
           }
         }
         /* always cleanup */
         curl_easy_cleanup(curl);
       }
