IPQ_SET_VERDICT(3)                                                                       Linux Programmer's Manual                                                                      IPQ_SET_VERDICT(3)

NAME
       ipq_set_verdict â€” issue verdict and optionally modified packet to kernel

SYNOPSIS
       #include <linux/netfilter.h>
       #include <libipq.h>

       int ipq_set_verdict(const struct ipq_handle *h, ipq_id_t id, unsigned int verdict, size_t data_len, unsigned char *buf);

DESCRIPTION
       The  ipq_set_verdict function issues a verdict on a packet previously obtained with ipq_read, specifying the intended disposition of the packet, and optionally supplying a modified version of the
       payload data.

       The h parameter is a context handle which must previously have been returned successfully from a call to ipq_create_handle.

       The id parameter is the packet identifier obtained via ipq_get_packet.

       The verdict parameter must be one of:

       NF_ACCEPT
              Accept the packet and continue traversal within the kernel.

       NF_DROP
              Drop the packet.

       NF_QUEUE
              Requeue the packet.

       NF_STOLEN and NF_REPEAT are kernel-internal constants and should not be used from userspace as their exact side effects have not been investigated.

       The data_len parameter is the length of the data pointed to by buf, the optional replacement payload data.

       If simply setting a verdict without modifying the payload data, use zero for data_len and NULL for buf.

       The application is responsible for recalculating any packet checksums when modifying packets.

RETURN VALUE
       On failure, -1 is returned.
       On success, a non-zero positive value is returned.

ERRORS
       On error, a descriptive error message will be available via the ipq_errstr function.

BUGS
       None known.
