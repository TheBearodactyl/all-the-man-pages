NAME
       gnutls_decode_ber_digest_info - API function

SYNOPSIS
       #include <gnutls/crypto.h>

       int gnutls_decode_ber_digest_info(const gnutls_datum_t * info, gnutls_digest_algorithm_t * hash, unsigned char * digest, unsigned int * digest_size);

ARGUMENTS
       const gnutls_datum_t * info
                   an RSA BER encoded DigestInfo structure

       gnutls_digest_algorithm_t * hash
                   will contain the hash algorithm of the structure

       unsigned char * digest
                   will contain the hash output of the structure

       unsigned int * digest_size
                   will contain the hash size of the structure; initially must hold the maximum size of  digest

DESCRIPTION
       This function will parse an RSA PKCS1 1.5 DigestInfo structure and report the hash algorithm used as well as the digest data.

RETURNS
       On success, GNUTLS_E_SUCCESS (0) is returned, otherwise an error code is returned.

SINCE
       3.5.0
