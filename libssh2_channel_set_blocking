NAME
       libssh2_channel_set_blocking - set or clear blocking mode on channel

SYNOPSIS
       #include <libssh2.h>

       void libssh2_channel_set_blocking(LIBSSH2_CHANNEL *channel, int blocking);

DESCRIPTION
       channel - channel stream to set or clean blocking status on.

       blocking - Set to a non-zero value to make the channel block, or zero to make it non-blocking.

       Currently this is just a short cut call to libssh2_session_set_blocking(3) and therefore will affect the session and all channels.

RETURN VALUE
       None
