RSA_SIZE(3ssl)                      OpenSSL                     RSA_SIZE(3ssl)

NAME
       RSA_size, RSA_bits, RSA_security_bits - get RSA modulus size or
       security bits

SYNOPSIS
        #include <openssl/rsa.h>

        int RSA_bits(const RSA *rsa);

       The following functions have been deprecated since OpenSSL 3.0, and can
       be hidden entirely by defining OPENSSL_API_COMPAT with a suitable
       version value, see openssl_user_macros(7):

        int RSA_size(const RSA *rsa);

        int RSA_security_bits(const RSA *rsa);

DESCRIPTION
       RSA_bits() returns the number of significant bits.

       rsa and rsa->n must not be NULL.

       The remaining functions described on this page are deprecated.
       Applications should instead use EVP_PKEY_get_size(3),
       EVP_PKEY_get_bits(3) and EVP_PKEY_get_security_bits(3).

       RSA_size() returns the RSA modulus size in bytes. It can be used to
       determine how much memory must be allocated for an RSA encrypted value.

       RSA_security_bits() returns the number of security bits of the given
       rsa key. See BN_security_bits(3).

RETURN VALUES
       RSA_bits() returns the number of bits in the key.

       RSA_size() returns the size of modulus in bytes.

       RSA_security_bits() returns the number of security bits.

SEE ALSO
       BN_num_bits(3)

HISTORY
       The RSA_size() and RSA_security_bits() functions were deprecated in
       OpenSSL 3.0.

       The RSA_bits() function was added in OpenSSL 1.1.0.
