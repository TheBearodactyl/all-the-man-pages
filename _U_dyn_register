NAME
       _U_dyn_register -- register unwind-info for dynamically generated code

SYNOPSIS
       #include <libunwind.h>

       void _U_dyn_register(unw_dyn_info_t *di);

DESCRIPTION
       The  _U_dyn_register()  routine  registers  unwind-info  for  a  dynamically generated procedure. The procedure's unwind-info is described by a structure of type unw_dyn_info_t (see libunwind-dy‚Äê
       namic(3)).  A pointer to this structure is passed in argument di.

       The _U_dyn_register() routine is guaranteed to execute in constant time (in the absence of contention from concurrent calls to _U_dyn_register() or _U_dyn_cancel()).

THREAD AND SIGNAL SAFETY
       _U_dyn_register() is thread-safe but not safe to use from a signal handler.
