NAME
       CURLOPT_FRESH_CONNECT - force a new connection to be used

SYNOPSIS
       #include <curl/curl.h>

       CURLcode curl_easy_setopt(CURL *handle, CURLOPT_FRESH_CONNECT, long fresh);

DESCRIPTION
       Pass  a long. Set to 1 to make the next transfer use a new (fresh) connection by force instead of trying to re-use an existing one.  This option should be used with caution and only if you under‚Äê
       stand what it does as it may seriously impact performance.

       Related functionality is CURLOPT_FORBID_REUSE(3) which makes sure the connection is closed after use so that it will not be re-used.

       Set fresh to 0 to have libcurl attempt re-using an existing connection (default behavior).

DEFAULT
       0
