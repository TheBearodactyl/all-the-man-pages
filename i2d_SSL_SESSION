D2I_SSL_SESSION(3ssl)                                                                             OpenSSL                                                                            D2I_SSL_SESSION(3ssl)

NAME
       d2i_SSL_SESSION, i2d_SSL_SESSION - convert SSL_SESSION object from/to ASN1 representation

SYNOPSIS
        #include <openssl/ssl.h>

        SSL_SESSION *d2i_SSL_SESSION(SSL_SESSION **a, const unsigned char **pp,
                                     long length);
        int i2d_SSL_SESSION(SSL_SESSION *in, unsigned char **pp);

DESCRIPTION
       These functions decode and encode an SSL_SESSION object.  For encoding details see d2i_X509(3).

       SSL_SESSION objects keep internal link information about the session cache list, when being inserted into one SSL_CTX object's session cache.  One SSL_SESSION object, regardless of its reference
       count, must therefore only be used with one SSL_CTX object (and the SSL objects created from this SSL_CTX object).

RETURN VALUES
       d2i_SSL_SESSION() returns a pointer to the newly allocated SSL_SESSION object. In case of failure the NULL-pointer is returned and the error message can be retrieved from the error stack.

       i2d_SSL_SESSION() returns the size of the ASN1 representation in bytes.  When the session is not valid, 0 is returned and no operation is performed.
