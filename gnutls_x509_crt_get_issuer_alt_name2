NAME
       gnutls_x509_crt_get_issuer_alt_name2 - API function

SYNOPSIS
       #include <gnutls/x509.h>

       int gnutls_x509_crt_get_issuer_alt_name2(gnutls_x509_crt_t cert, unsigned int seq, void * ian, size_t * ian_size, unsigned int * ian_type, unsigned int * critical);

ARGUMENTS
       gnutls_x509_crt_t cert
                   should contain a gnutls_x509_crt_t type

       unsigned int seq
                   specifies the sequence number of the alt name (0 for the first one, 1 for the second etc.)

       void * ian  is the place where the alternative name will be copied to

       size_t * ian_size
                   holds the size of ret.

       unsigned int * ian_type
                   holds the type of the alternative name (one of gnutls_x509_subject_alt_name_t).

       unsigned int * critical
                   will be non-zero if the extension is marked as critical (may be null)

DESCRIPTION
       This  function  will  return the alternative names, contained in the given certificate. It is the same as gnutls_x509_crt_get_issuer_alt_name() except for the fact that it will return the type of
       the alternative name in  ian_type even if the function fails for some reason (i.e.  the buffer provided is not enough).

RETURNS
       the alternative issuer name type on success, one of the enumerated gnutls_x509_subject_alt_name_t.  It will return GNUTLS_E_SHORT_MEMORY_BUFFER if  ian_size is not large enough to hold the value.
       In  that case  ian_size will be updated with the required size.  If the certificate does not have an Alternative name with the specified sequence number then GNUTLS_E_REQUESTED_DATA_NOT_AVAILABLE
       is returned.

SINCE
       2.10.0
