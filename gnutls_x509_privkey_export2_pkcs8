NAME
       gnutls_x509_privkey_export2_pkcs8 - API function

SYNOPSIS
       #include <gnutls/x509.h>

       int gnutls_x509_privkey_export2_pkcs8(gnutls_x509_privkey_t key, gnutls_x509_crt_fmt_t format, const char * password, unsigned int flags, gnutls_datum_t * out);

ARGUMENTS
       gnutls_x509_privkey_t key
                   Holds the key

       gnutls_x509_crt_fmt_t format
                   the format of output params. One of PEM or DER.

       const char * password
                   the password that will be used to encrypt the key.

       unsigned int flags
                   an ORed sequence of gnutls_pkcs_encrypt_flags_t

       gnutls_datum_t * out
                   will contain a private key PEM or DER encoded

DESCRIPTION
       This function will export the private key to a PKCS8 structure.  Both RSA and DSA keys can be exported. For DSA keys we use PKCS 11 definitions. If the flags do not specify the encryption cipher,
       then the default 3DES (PBES2) will be used.

       The  password can be either ASCII or UTF-8 in the default PBES2 encryption schemas, or ASCII for the PKCS12 schemas.

       The output buffer is allocated using gnutls_malloc().

       If the structure is PEM encoded, it will have a header of "BEGIN ENCRYPTED PRIVATE KEY" or "BEGIN PRIVATE KEY" if encryption is not used.

RETURNS
       In case of failure a negative error code will be returned, and 0 on success.

       Since 3.1.3
