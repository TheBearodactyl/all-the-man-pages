PCRE2_MAKETABLES(3)        Library Functions Manual        PCRE2_MAKETABLES(3)

NAME
       PCRE2 - Perl-compatible regular expressions (revised API)

SYNOPSIS

       #include <pcre2.h>

       const uint8_t *pcre2_maketables(pcre2_general_context *gcontext);

DESCRIPTION

       This  function  builds  a  set  of  character tables for character code
       points that are less than 256. These can be passed  to  pcre2_compile()
       in a compile context in order to override the internal, built-in tables
       (which were either defaulted or made by pcre2_maketables()  when  PCRE2
       was  compiled).  See  the  pcre2_set_character_tables() page. You might
       want to do this if you are using a non-standard locale.

       If the argument is NULL, malloc() is used to get memory for the tables.
       Otherwise it must point to a general context, which can supply pointers
       to a custom memory manager. The function yields a pointer  to  the  ta‚Äê
       bles.

       There is a complete description of the PCRE2 native API in the pcre2api
       page and a description of the POSIX API in the pcre2posix page.
