PCRE2_MATCH(3)             Library Functions Manual             PCRE2_MATCH(3)

NAME
       PCRE2 - Perl-compatible regular expressions (revised API)

SYNOPSIS

       #include <pcre2.h>

       int pcre2_match(const pcre2_code *code, PCRE2_SPTR subject,
         PCRE2_SIZE length, PCRE2_SIZE startoffset,
         uint32_t options, pcre2_match_data *match_data,
         pcre2_match_context *mcontext);

DESCRIPTION

       This  function  matches  a  compiled regular expression against a given
       subject string, using a matching algorithm that is similar  to  Perl's.
       It  returns  offsets  to what it has matched and to captured substrings
       via the match_data block, which can  be  processed  by  functions  with
       names that start with pcre2_get_ovector_...() or pcre2_substring_...().
       The return from pcre2_match() is one more  than  the  highest  numbered
       capturing  pair  that has been set (for example, 1 if there are no cap‐
       tures), zero if the vector of offsets is too small, or a negative error
       code for no match and other errors. The function arguments are:

         code         Points to the compiled pattern
         subject      Points to the subject string
         length       Length of the subject string
         startoffset  Offset in the subject at which to start matching
         options      Option bits
         match_data   Points to a match data block, for results
         mcontext     Points to a match context, or is NULL

       A match context is needed only if you want to:

         Set up a callout function
         Set a matching offset limit
         Change the heap memory limit
         Change the backtracking match limit
         Change the backtracking depth limit
         Set custom memory management specifically for the match

       The  length and startoffset values are code units, not characters.  The
       length may be given as PCRE2_ZERO_TERMINATED for a subject that is ter‐
       minated by a binary zero code unit. The options are:

         PCRE2_ANCHORED          Match only at the first position
         PCRE2_COPY_MATCHED_SUBJECT
                                 On success, make a private subject copy
         PCRE2_ENDANCHORED       Pattern can match only at end of subject
         PCRE2_NOTBOL            Subject string is not the beginning of a line
         PCRE2_NOTEOL            Subject string is not the end of a line
         PCRE2_NOTEMPTY          An empty string is not a valid match
         PCRE2_NOTEMPTY_ATSTART  An empty string at the start of the subject
                                  is not a valid match
         PCRE2_NO_JIT            Do not use JIT matching
         PCRE2_NO_UTF_CHECK      Do not check the subject for UTF
                                  validity (only relevant if PCRE2_UTF
                                  was set at compile time)
         PCRE2_PARTIAL_HARD      Return PCRE2_ERROR_PARTIAL for a partial
                                  match even if there is a full match
         PCRE2_PARTIAL_SOFT      Return PCRE2_ERROR_PARTIAL for a partial
                                  match if no full matches are found

       For  details of partial matching, see the pcre2partial page. There is a
       complete description of the PCRE2 native API in the pcre2api page and a
       description of the POSIX API in the pcre2posix page.
