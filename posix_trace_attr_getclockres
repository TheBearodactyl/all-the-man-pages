POSIX_TRACE_ATTR_GETCLOCKREPOSIX Programmer's POSIX_TRACE_ATTR_GETCLOCKRES(3P)

PROLOG
       This  manual  page is part of the POSIX Programmer's Manual.  The Linux
       implementation of this interface may differ (consult the  corresponding
       Linux  manual page for details of Linux behavior), or the interface may
       not be implemented on Linux.

NAME
       posix_trace_attr_getclockres,           posix_trace_attr_getcreatetime,
       posix_trace_attr_getgenversion,               posix_trace_attr_getname,
       posix_trace_attr_setname — retrieve and set information about  a  trace
       stream (TRACING)

SYNOPSIS
       #include <time.h>
       #include <trace.h>

       int posix_trace_attr_getclockres(const trace_attr_t *attr,
           struct timespec *resolution);
       int posix_trace_attr_getcreatetime(const trace_attr_t *attr,
           struct timespec *createtime);

       #include <trace.h>

       int posix_trace_attr_getgenversion(const trace_attr_t *attr,
           char *genversion);
       int posix_trace_attr_getname(const trace_attr_t *attr,
           char *tracename);
       int posix_trace_attr_setname(trace_attr_t *attr,
           const char *tracename);

DESCRIPTION
       The  posix_trace_attr_getclockres() function shall copy the clock reso‐
       lution of the clock used to generate timestamps from the  clock-resolu‐
       tion attribute of the attributes object pointed to by the attr argument
       into the structure pointed to by the resolution argument.

       The posix_trace_attr_getcreatetime()  function  shall  copy  the  trace
       stream creation time from the creation-time attribute of the attributes
       object pointed to by the attr argument into the structure pointed to by
       the  createtime  argument.  The creation-time attribute shall represent
       the time of creation of the trace stream.

       The posix_trace_attr_getgenversion() function  shall  copy  the  string
       containing version information from the generation-version attribute of
       the attributes object pointed to by the attr argument into  the  string
       pointed to by the genversion argument. The genversion argument shall be
       the  address  of  a  character  array  which   can   store   at   least
       {TRACE_NAME_MAX} characters.

       The  posix_trace_attr_getname() function shall copy the string contain‐
       ing the trace name from the trace-name attribute of the attributes  ob‐
       ject  pointed to by the attr argument into the string pointed to by the
       tracename argument. The tracename argument shall be the  address  of  a
       character array which can store at least {TRACE_NAME_MAX} characters.

       The  posix_trace_attr_setname()  function  shall  set  the  name in the
       trace-name attribute of the attributes object pointed to  by  the  attr
       argument,  using  the trace name string supplied by the tracename argu‐
       ment. If the supplied string contains more than {TRACE_NAME_MAX}  char‐
       acters,  the name copied into the trace-name attribute may be truncated
       to one less than the length of {TRACE_NAME_MAX} characters. The default
       value is a null string.

RETURN VALUE
       Upon  successful  completion,  these  functions shall return a value of
       zero. Otherwise, they shall return the corresponding error number.

       If successful, the posix_trace_attr_getclockres() function  stores  the
       clock-resolution  attribute  value  in the object pointed to by resolu‐
       tion.  Otherwise, the content of this object is unspecified.

       If successful, the posix_trace_attr_getcreatetime() function stores the
       trace  stream  creation  time  in  the object pointed to by createtime.
       Otherwise, the content of this object is unspecified.

       If successful, the posix_trace_attr_getgenversion() function stores the
       trace version information in the string pointed to by genversion.  Oth‐
       erwise, the content of this string is unspecified.

       If successful, the posix_trace_attr_getname() function stores the trace
       name  in the string pointed to by tracename.  Otherwise, the content of
       this string is unspecified.

ERRORS
       The  posix_trace_attr_getclockres(),  posix_trace_attr_getcreatetime(),
       posix_trace_attr_getgenversion(),  and posix_trace_attr_getname() func‐
       tions may fail if:

       EINVAL The value specified by one of the arguments is invalid.

FUTURE DIRECTIONS
       The  posix_trace_attr_getclockres(),  posix_trace_attr_getcreatetime(),
       posix_trace_attr_getgenversion(),    posix_trace_attr_getname(),    and
       posix_trace_attr_setname() functions may be removed in  a  future  ver‐
       sion.
