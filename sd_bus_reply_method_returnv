NAME
       sd_bus_reply_method_return, sd_bus_reply_method_returnv - Reply to a
       D-Bus method call

SYNOPSIS
       #include <systemd/sd-bus.h>

       int sd_bus_reply_method_return(sd_bus_message *call, const char *types,
                                      ...);

       int sd_bus_reply_method_returnv(sd_bus_message *call,
                                       const char *types, va_list ap);

DESCRIPTION
       sd_bus_reply_method_return() sends a reply to the call message. The
       type string types and the arguments that follow it must adhere to the
       format described in sd_bus_message_append(3). If no reply is expected
       to call, this function succeeds without sending a reply.

RETURN VALUE
       On success, this function returns a non-negative integer. On failure,
       it returns a negative errno-style error code.

   Errors
       Returned errors may indicate the following problems:

       -EINVAL
           The input parameter call is NULL.

           Message call is not a method call message.

           Message call is not attached to a bus.

           Message m is not a method reply message.

       -EPERM
           Message call has been sealed.

       -ENOTCONN
           The bus to which message call is attached is not connected.

       -ENOMEM
           Memory allocation failed.

       In addition, any error returned by sd_bus_send(1) may be returned.

NOTES
       These APIs are implemented as a shared library, which can be compiled
       and linked to with the libsystemd pkg-config(1) file.
