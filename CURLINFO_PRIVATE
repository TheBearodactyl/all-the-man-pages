NAME
       CURLINFO_PRIVATE - get the private pointer

SYNOPSIS
       #include <curl/curl.h>

       CURLcode curl_easy_getinfo(CURL *handle, CURLINFO_PRIVATE, char **private);

DESCRIPTION
       Pass a pointer to a char pointer to receive the pointer to the private data associated with the curl handle (set with the CURLOPT_PRIVATE(3)).  Please note that for internal reasons, the value is
       returned as a char pointer, although effectively being a 'void *'.

PROTOCOLS
       All

EXAMPLE
       CURL *curl = curl_easy_init();
       if(curl) {
         void *pointer = 0x2345454;
         curl_easy_setopt(curl, CURLOPT_URL, "https://example.com/foo.bin");

         /* set the private pointer */
         curl_easy_setopt(curl, CURLOPT_PRIVATE, pointer);
         ret = curl_easy_perform(curl);

         /* extract the private pointer again */
         ret = curl_easy_getinfo(curl, CURLINFO_PRIVATE, &pointer);

         curl_easy_cleanup(curl);
       }

AVAILABILITY
       Added in 7.10.3
