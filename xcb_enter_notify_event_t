   Event datastructure
       typedef struct xcb_enter_notify_event_t {
           uint8_t         response_type;
           uint8_t         detail;

EVENT FIELDS
       response_type
                 The type of this event, in this case XCB_LEAVE_NOTIFY. This field is also present in the xcb_generic_event_t and can be used to tell events apart from each other.

       sequence  The sequence number of the last request processed by the X11 server.

       detail    NOT YET DOCUMENTED.

       time      NOT YET DOCUMENTED.

       root      The root window for the final cursor position.

       event     The window on which the event was generated.

       child     If the event window has subwindows and the final pointer position is in one of them, then child is set to that subwindow, XCB_WINDOW_NONE otherwise.

       root_x    The pointer X coordinate relative to root's origin at the time of the event.

       root_y    The pointer Y coordinate relative to root's origin at the time of the event.

       event_x   If event is on the same screen as root, this is the pointer X coordinate relative to the event window's origin.

       event_y   If event is on the same screen as root, this is the pointer Y coordinate relative to the event window's origin.

       state     NOT YET DOCUMENTED.

       mode

       same_screen_focus
                 NOT YET DOCUMENTED.
