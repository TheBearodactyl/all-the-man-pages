DESCRIPTION
       Pass  a  pointer  to a curl_off_t to receive the total time, in microseconds, it took for all redirection steps include name lookup, connect, pretransfer and transfer before final transaction was

         res = curl_easy_perform(curl);
         if(CURLE_OK == res) {
           res = curl_easy_getinfo(curl, CURLINFO_REDIRECT_TIME_T, &redirect);
           if(CURLE_OK == res) {
             printf("Time: %" CURL_FORMAT_CURL_OFF_T ".%06ld", redirect / 1000000,
                    (long)(redirect % 1000000));
