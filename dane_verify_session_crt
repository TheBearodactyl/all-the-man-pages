NAME
       dane_verify_session_crt - API function

SYNOPSIS
       #include <gnutls/dane.h>

       int  dane_verify_session_crt(dane_state_t  s, gnutls_session_t session, const char * hostname, const char * proto, unsigned int port, unsigned int sflags, unsigned int vflags, unsigned int * ver‐
       ify);

ARGUMENTS
       dane_state_t s
                   A DANE state structure (may be NULL)

       gnutls_session_t session
                   A gnutls session

       const char * hostname
                   The hostname associated with the chain

       const char * proto
                   The protocol of the service connecting (e.g. tcp)

       unsigned int port
                   The port of the service connecting (e.g. 443)

       unsigned int sflags
                   Flags for the initialization of  s (if NULL)

       unsigned int vflags
                   Verification flags; an OR'ed list of dane_verify_flags_t.

       unsigned int * verify
                   An OR'ed list of dane_verify_status_t.

DESCRIPTION
       This function will verify session's certificate chain against the CA constrains and/or the certificate available via DANE.  See dane_verify_crt() for more information.

       This will not verify the chain for validity; unless the DANE verification is restricted to end certificates, this must be be performed separately using gnutls_certificate_verify_peers3().

RETURNS
       a negative error code on error and DANE_E_SUCCESS (0) when the DANE entries were successfully parsed, irrespective of whether they were verified (see  verify for that information). If  no  usable
       entries were encountered DANE_E_REQUESTED_DATA_NOT_AVAILABLE will be returned.
