NAME
       gnutls_privkey_sign_hash - API function

SYNOPSIS
       #include <gnutls/abstract.h>

       int gnutls_privkey_sign_hash(gnutls_privkey_t signer, gnutls_digest_algorithm_t hash_algo, unsigned int flags, const gnutls_datum_t * hash_data, gnutls_datum_t * signature);

ARGUMENTS
       gnutls_privkey_t signer
                   Holds the signer's key

       gnutls_digest_algorithm_t hash_algo
                   The hash algorithm used

       unsigned int flags
                   Zero or one of gnutls_privkey_flags_t

       const gnutls_datum_t * hash_data
                   holds the data to be signed

       gnutls_datum_t * signature
                   will contain newly allocated signature

DESCRIPTION
       This  function will sign the given hashed data using a signature algorithm supported by the private key. Signature algorithms are always used together with a hash functions.  Different hash func‐
       tions may be used for the RSA algorithm, but only SHA-XXX for the DSA keys.

       You may use gnutls_pubkey_get_preferred_hash_algorithm() to determine the hash algorithm.

       The flags may be GNUTLS_PRIVKEY_SIGN_FLAG_TLS1_RSA or GNUTLS_PRIVKEY_SIGN_FLAG_RSA_PSS.  In the former case this function will ignore  hash_algo and perform a raw PKCS1 signature, and in the lat‐
       ter an RSA-PSS signature will be generated.

       Note that, not all algorithm support signing already hashed data. When signing with Ed25519, gnutls_privkey_sign_data() should be used.

RETURNS
       On success, GNUTLS_E_SUCCESS (0) is returned, otherwise a negative error value.

SINCE
       2.12.0
