NAME
       fgetpos, fseek, fsetpos, ftell, rewind - reposition a stream

LIBRARY
       Standard C library (libc, -lc)

SYNOPSIS
       #include <stdio.h>

       int fseek(FILE *stream, long offset, int whence);
       long ftell(FILE *stream);

       void rewind(FILE *stream);

       int fgetpos(FILE *restrict stream, fpos_t *restrict pos);
       int fsetpos(FILE *stream, const fpos_t *pos);

DESCRIPTION
       The  fseek()  function  sets the file position indicator for the stream pointed to by stream.  The new position, measured in bytes, is obtained by adding offset bytes to the position specified by
       whence.  If whence is set to SEEK_SET, SEEK_CUR, or SEEK_END, the offset is relative to the start of the file, the current position indicator, or end-of-file, respectively.  A successful call  to
       the fseek() function clears the end-of-file indicator for the stream and undoes any effects of the ungetc(3) function on the same stream.

       The ftell() function obtains the current value of the file position indicator for the stream pointed to by stream.

       The rewind() function sets the file position indicator for the stream pointed to by stream to the beginning of the file.  It is equivalent to:

              (void) fseek(stream, 0L, SEEK_SET)

       except that the error indicator for the stream is also cleared (see clearerr(3)).

       The  fgetpos()  and  fsetpos() functions are alternate interfaces equivalent to ftell() and fseek() (with whence set to SEEK_SET), setting and storing the current value of the file offset into or
       from the object referenced by pos.  On some non-UNIX systems, an fpos_t object may be a complex object and these routines may be the only way to portably reposition a text stream.

       If the stream refers to a regular file and the resulting stream offset is beyond the size of the file, subsequent writes will extend the file with a hole, up to the offset, before committing  any
       data.  See lseek(2) for details on file seeking semantics.

RETURN VALUE
       The rewind() function returns no value.  Upon successful completion, fgetpos(), fseek(), fsetpos() return 0, and ftell() returns the current offset.  Otherwise, -1 is returned and errno is set to
       indicate the error.

ERRORS
       EINVAL The whence argument to fseek() was not SEEK_SET, SEEK_END, or SEEK_CUR.  Or: the resulting file offset would be negative.

       ESPIPE The file descriptor underlying stream is not seekable (e.g., it refers to a pipe, FIFO, or socket).

       The functions fgetpos(), fseek(), fsetpos(), and ftell() may also fail and set errno for any of the errors specified for the routines fflush(3), fstat(2), lseek(2), and malloc(3).

NAME
       fsetpos — set current file position

SYNOPSIS
       #include <stdio.h>

       int fsetpos(FILE *stream, const fpos_t *pos);

DESCRIPTION
       The functionality described on this reference page is aligned with the ISO C standard. Any conflict between the requirements described here and the ISO C standard is unintentional. This volume of
       POSIX.1‐2017 defers to the ISO C standard.

       The fsetpos() function shall set the file position and state indicators for the stream pointed to by stream according to the value of the object pointed to by pos, which the application shall en‐
       sure is a value obtained from an earlier call to fgetpos() on the same stream. If a read or write error occurs, the error indicator for the stream shall be set and fsetpos() fails.

       A successful call to the fsetpos() function shall clear the end-of-file indicator for the stream and undo any effects of ungetc() on the same stream. After an fsetpos() call, the  next  operation
       on an update stream may be either input or output.

       The behavior of fsetpos() on devices which are incapable of seeking is implementation-defined.  The value of the file offset associated with such a device is undefined.

       The fsetpos() function shall not change the setting of errno if successful.

RETURN VALUE
       The fsetpos() function shall return 0 if it succeeds; otherwise, it shall return a non-zero value and set errno to indicate the error.

ERRORS
       The fsetpos() function shall fail if, either the stream is unbuffered or the stream's buffer needed to be flushed, and the call to fsetpos() causes an underlying lseek() or write() to be invoked,
       and:

       EAGAIN The O_NONBLOCK flag is set for the file descriptor and the thread would be delayed in the write operation.

       EBADF  The file descriptor underlying the stream file is not open for writing or the stream's buffer needed to be flushed and the file is not open.

       EFBIG  An attempt was made to write a file that exceeds the maximum file size.

       EFBIG  An attempt was made to write a file that exceeds the file size limit of the process.

       EFBIG  The file is a regular file and an attempt was made to write at or beyond the offset maximum associated with the corresponding stream.

       EINTR  The write operation was terminated due to the receipt of a signal, and no data was transferred.

       EIO    A physical I/O error has occurred, or the process is a member of a background process group attempting to perform a write() to its controlling terminal, TOSTOP is set, the  calling  thread
              is not blocking SIGTTOU, the process is not ignoring SIGTTOU, and the process group of the process is orphaned.  This error may also be returned under implementation-defined conditions.

       ENOSPC There was no free space remaining on the device containing the file.

       EPIPE  An attempt was made to write to a pipe or FIFO that is not open for reading by any process; a SIGPIPE signal shall also be sent to the thread.

       ESPIPE The file descriptor underlying stream is associated with a pipe, FIFO, or socket.

       The fsetpos() function may fail if:

       ENXIO  A request was made of a nonexistent device, or the request was outside the capabilities of the device.
