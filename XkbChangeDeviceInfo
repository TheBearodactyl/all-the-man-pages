NAME
       XkbChangeDeviceInfo - Update the server's description of a device with the changes noted in an XkbDeviceChangesRec

SYNOPSIS
       Bool XkbChangeDeviceInfo (Display *dpy, XkbDeviceInfoPtr device_info, XkbDeviceChangesPtr changes);

ARGUMENTS
       dpy    connection to X server

       device_info
              local copy of device state and configuration

       changes
              note specifying changes in device_info

DESCRIPTION
       XkbChangeDeviceInfo updates the server's description of the device specified in device_info->device_spec with the changes specified in changes and contained in device_info.  The update is made by
       an XkbSetDeviceInfo request.

STRUCTURES
       Changes to an Xkb extension device may be tracked by listening to XkbDeviceExtensionNotify events and accumulating the changes in an XkbDeviceChangesRec structure. The changes noted in the struc‚Äê
       ture may then be used in subsequent operations to update either a server configuration or a local copy of an Xkb extension device configuration. The changes structure is defined as follows:

       typedef struct _XkbDeviceChanges {
           unsigned int         changed;        /* bits indicating what has changed */
           unsigned short       first_btn;      /* number of first button which changed, if any */
           unsigned short       num_btns;       /* number of buttons that have changed */
           XkbDeviceLedChangesRec leds;
       } XkbDeviceChangesRec,*XkbDeviceChangesPtr;
