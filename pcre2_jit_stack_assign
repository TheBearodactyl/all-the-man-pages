PCRE2_JIT_STACK_ASSIGN(3)  Library Functions Manual  PCRE2_JIT_STACK_ASSIGN(3)

NAME
       PCRE2 - Perl-compatible regular expressions (revised API)

SYNOPSIS

       #include <pcre2.h>

       void pcre2_jit_stack_assign(pcre2_match_context *mcontext,
         pcre2_jit_callback callback_function, void *callback_data);

DESCRIPTION

       This  function  provides  control over the memory used by JIT as a run-
       time stack when pcre2_match() or pcre2_jit_match()  is  called  with  a
       pattern  that  has been successfully processed by the JIT compiler. The
       information that determines which stack is used is  put  into  a  match
       context  that  is subsequently passed to a matching function. The argu‚Äê
       ments of this function are:

         mcontext       a pointer to a match context
         callback       a callback function
         callback_data  a JIT stack or a value to be passed to the callback

       If mcontext is NULL, the function returns  immediately,  without  doing
       anything.

       If  callback is NULL and callback_data is NULL, an internal 32KiB block
       on the machine stack is used.

       If callback is NULL and callback_data is not NULL,  callback_data  must
       be a valid JIT stack, the result of calling pcre2_jit_stack_create().

       If callback not NULL, it is called with callback_data as an argument at
       the start of matching, in order to set up a JIT stack. If the result is
       NULL, the internal 32KiB stack is used; otherwise the return value must
       be a valid JIT stack, the result of calling pcre2_jit_stack_create().

       You may safely use the same JIT stack for multiple patterns, as long as
       they  are all matched in the same thread. In a multithread application,
       each thread must use its own JIT  stack.  For  more  details,  see  the
       pcre2jit page.

       There is a complete description of the PCRE2 native API in the pcre2api
       page and a description of the POSIX API in the pcre2posix page.
