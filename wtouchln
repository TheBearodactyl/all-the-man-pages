NAME
       touchwin, touchline, untouchwin, wtouchln, is_linetouched, is_wintouched - curses refresh control routines

SYNOPSIS
       #include <curses.h>

       int touchline(WINDOW *win, int start, int count);

       int touchwin(WINDOW *win);
       int wtouchln(WINDOW *win, int y, int n, int changed);

       int untouchwin(WINDOW *win);

       bool is_linetouched(WINDOW *win, int line);
       bool is_wintouched(WINDOW *win);

DESCRIPTION
       The  touchwin  and  touchline  routines throw away all optimization information about which parts of the window have been touched, by pretending that the entire window has been drawn on.  This is
       sometimes necessary when using overlapping windows, since a change to one window affects the other window, but the records of which lines have been changed in the other window do not reflect  the
       change.  The routine touchline only pretends that count lines have been changed, beginning with line start.

       The untouchwin routine marks all lines in the window as unchanged since the last call to wrefresh.

       The wtouchln routine makes n lines in the window, starting at line y, look as if they have (changed=1) or have not (changed=0) been changed since the last call to wrefresh.

       The  is_linetouched and is_wintouched routines return TRUE if the specified line/window was modified since the last call to wrefresh; otherwise they return FALSE.  In addition, is_linetouched re‐
       turns ERR if line is not valid for the given window.

RETURN VALUE
       All routines return the integer ERR upon failure and an integer value other than ERR upon successful completion, unless otherwise noted in the preceding routine descriptions.

       X/Open does not define any error conditions.  In this implementation

          is_linetouched
               returns an error if the window pointer is null, or if the line number is outside the window.

               The constant ERR is distinct from TRUE and FALSE, which are the normal return values of this function.  Because the function returns a bool, returning  ERR  (which  is  neither  TRUE  nor
               FALSE) may not be supported by the compiler.

               To provide error-checking and also match the X/Open function prototype, the ERR is provided by a macro named is_linetouched.  The actual function returns FALSE when it detects an error.

          wtouchln
               returns an error if the window pointer is null, or if the line number is outside the window.

PORTABILITY
       These  functions  were  introduced by SVr4.  The Solaris curses header file, for instance, defines both an actual function and macro for each.  The macros give the same result as the actual func‐
       tions.  SVr4 curses does not check the window parameter win to ensure that it is not NULL; otherwise this implementation behaves the same as SVr4.

       The XSI Curses standard, Issue 4 describes these functions, but defines no error conditions.

NOTES
       All of these routines except wtouchln may be macros.
