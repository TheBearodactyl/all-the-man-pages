NAME
       winecfg - Wine Configuration Editor

SYNOPSIS
       winecfg [options]

DESCRIPTION
       winecfg  is  the  Wine  configuration editor. It allows you to change several settings, such as DLL load order (native versus builtin), enable a virtual desktop, setup disk drives, and change the
       Wine audio driver, among others. Many of these settings can be made on a per application basis, for example, preferring native riched20.dll for wordpad.exe, but not for notepad.exe.

       If no option is given launch the graphical version of winecfg.
