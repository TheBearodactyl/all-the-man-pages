NAME
       gnutls_x509_crq_get_dn_by_oid - API function

SYNOPSIS
       #include <gnutls/x509.h>

       int gnutls_x509_crq_get_dn_by_oid(gnutls_x509_crq_t crq, const char * oid, unsigned indx, unsigned int raw_flag, void * buf, size_t * buf_size);

ARGUMENTS
       gnutls_x509_crq_t crq
                   should contain a gnutls_x509_crq_t type

       const char * oid
                   holds an Object Identifier in a null terminated string

       unsigned indx
                   In case multiple same OIDs exist in the RDN, this specifies which to get. Use (0) to get the first one.

       unsigned int raw_flag
                   If non-zero returns the raw DER data of the DN part.

       void * buf  a pointer to a structure to hold the name (may be NULL)

       size_t * buf_size
                   initially holds the size of  buf

DESCRIPTION
       This function will extract the part of the name of the Certificate request subject, specified by the given OID. The output will be encoded as described in RFC2253. The output string will be ASCII
       or UTF-8 encoded, depending on the certificate data.

       Some helper macros with popular OIDs can be found in gnutls/x509.h If raw flag is (0), this function will only return known OIDs as text. Other OIDs will be DER encoded, as described  in  RFC2253
       -- in hex format with a 'using gnutls_x509_dn_oid_known().

RETURNS
       GNUTLS_E_SHORT_MEMORY_BUFFER if the provided buffer is not long enough, and in that case the * buf_size will be updated with the required size.  On success 0 is returned.
