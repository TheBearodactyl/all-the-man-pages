NAME
       File::Spec::VMS - methods for VMS file specs

SYNOPSIS
        require File::Spec::VMS; # Done internally by File::Spec if needed

DESCRIPTION
       See File::Spec::Unix for a documentation of the methods provided there. This package overrides the implementation of these methods, not the semantics.

       The default behavior is to allow either VMS or Unix syntax on input and to return VMS syntax on output unless Unix syntax has been explicitly requested via the "DECC$FILENAME_UNIX_REPORT" CRTL
       feature.

       canonpath (override)
           Removes redundant portions of file specifications and returns results in native syntax unless Unix filename reporting has been enabled.

       catdir (override)
           Concatenates a list of file specifications, and returns the result as a native directory specification unless the Unix filename reporting feature has been enabled.  No check is made for
           "impossible" cases (e.g. elements other than the first being absolute filespecs).

       catfile (override)
           Concatenates a list of directory specifications with a filename specification to build a path.

       curdir (override)
           Returns a string representation of the current directory: '[]' or '.'

       devnull (override)
           Returns a string representation of the null device: '_NLA0:' or '/dev/null'

       rootdir (override)
           Returns a string representation of the root directory: 'SYS$DISK:[000000]' or '/'

       tmpdir (override)
           Returns a string representation of the first writable directory from the following list or '' if none are writable:

               /tmp if C<DECC$FILENAME_UNIX_REPORT> is enabled.
               sys$scratch:
               $ENV{TMPDIR}

           If running under taint mode, and if $ENV{TMPDIR} is tainted, it is not used.

       updir (override)
           Returns a string representation of the parent directory: '[-]' or '..'

       case_tolerant (override)
           VMS file specification syntax is case-tolerant.

       path (override)
           Translate logical name DCL$PATH as a searchlist, rather than trying to "split" string value of $ENV{'PATH'}.

       file_name_is_absolute (override)
           Checks for VMS directory spec as well as Unix separators.

       splitpath (override)
              ($volume,$directories,$file) = File::Spec->splitpath( $path );
              ($volume,$directories,$file) = File::Spec->splitpath( $path,
                                                                    $no_file );

           Passing a true value for $no_file indicates that the path being split only contains directory components, even on systems where you can usually (when not supporting a foreign syntax) tell the
           difference between directories and files at a glance.

       splitdir (override)
           Split a directory specification into the components.

       catpath (override)
           Construct a complete filespec.

       abs2rel (override)
           Attempt to convert an absolute file specification to a relative specification.

       rel2abs (override)
           Return an absolute file specification from a relative one.
