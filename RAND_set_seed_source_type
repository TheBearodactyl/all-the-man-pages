RAND_SET_DRBG_TYPE(3ssl)            OpenSSL           RAND_SET_DRBG_TYPE(3ssl)

NAME
       RAND_set_DRBG_type, RAND_set_seed_source_type - specify the global
       random number generator types

SYNOPSIS
        #include <openssl/rand.h>

        int RAND_set_DRBG_type(OSSL_LIB_CTX *ctx, const char *drbg, const char *propq,
                               const char *cipher, const char *digest);
        int RAND_set_seed_source_type(OSSL_LIB_CTX *ctx, const char *seed,
                                      const char *propq);

DESCRIPTION
       RAND_set_DRBG_type() specifies the random bit generator that will be
       used within the library context ctx.  A generator of name drbg with
       properties propq will be fetched.  It will be instantiated with either
       cipher or digest as its underlying cryptographic algorithm.  This
       specifies the type that will be used for the primary, public and
       private random instances.

       RAND_set_seed_source_type() specifies the seed source that will be used
       within the library context ctx.  The seed source of name seed with
       properties propq will be fetched and used to seed the primary random
       big generator.

RETURN VALUES
       These function return 1 on success and 0 on failure.

NOTES
       These functions must be called before the random bit generators are
       first created in the library context.  They will return an error if the
       call is made too late.

       The default DRBG is "CTR-DRBG" using the "AES-256-CTR" cipher.

       The default seed source is "SEED-SRC".
