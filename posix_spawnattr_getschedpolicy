PROLOG
       This  manual  page is part of the POSIX Programmer's Manual.  The Linux
       implementation of this interface may differ (consult the  corresponding
       Linux  manual page for details of Linux behavior), or the interface may
       not be implemented on Linux.

NAME
       posix_spawnattr_getschedpolicy,  posix_spawnattr_setschedpolicy  —  get
       and  set  the  spawn-schedpolicy attribute of a spawn attributes object
       (ADVANCED REALTIME)

SYNOPSIS
       #include <spawn.h>
       #include <sched.h>

       int posix_spawnattr_getschedpolicy(const posix_spawnattr_t
           *restrict attr, int *restrict schedpolicy);
       int posix_spawnattr_setschedpolicy(posix_spawnattr_t *attr,
           int schedpolicy);

DESCRIPTION
       The posix_spawnattr_getschedpolicy() function shall obtain the value of
       the  spawn-schedpolicy  attribute from the attributes object referenced
       by attr.

       The posix_spawnattr_setschedpolicy()  function  shall  set  the  spawn-
       schedpolicy attribute in an initialized attributes object referenced by
       attr.

       The spawn-schedpolicy attribute represents the scheduling policy to  be
       assigned   to   the   new  process  image  in  a  spawn  operation  (if
       POSIX_SPAWN_SETSCHEDULER is set in the spawn-flags attribute). The  de‐
       fault value of this attribute is unspecified.

RETURN VALUE
       Upon  successful completion, posix_spawnattr_getschedpolicy() shall re‐
       turn zero and store the value of  the  spawn-schedpolicy  attribute  of
       attr  into  the  object referenced by the schedpolicy parameter; other‐
       wise, an error number shall be returned to indicate the error.

       Upon successful completion, posix_spawnattr_setschedpolicy() shall  re‐
       turn zero; otherwise, an error number shall be returned to indicate the
       error.

ERRORS
       These functions may fail if:

       EINVAL The value specified by attr is invalid.

       The posix_spawnattr_setschedpolicy() function may fail if:

       EINVAL The value of the attribute being set is not valid.

       The following sections are informative.

EXAMPLES
       None.

APPLICATION USAGE
       These functions are part of the Spawn and  Process  Scheduling  options
       and need not be provided on all implementations.

RATIONALE
       None.

FUTURE DIRECTIONS
       None.
