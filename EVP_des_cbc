SYNOPSIS
        #include <openssl/evp.h>

        const EVP_CIPHER *EVP_ciphername(void)

       EVP_ciphername is used a placeholder for any of the described cipher functions, such as EVP_des_cbc.

DESCRIPTION
       The DES encryption algorithm for EVP.

       EVP_des_cbc(), EVP_des_ecb(), EVP_des_cfb(), EVP_des_cfb1(), EVP_des_cfb8(), EVP_des_cfb64(), EVP_des_ofb()
           DES in CBC, ECB, CFB with 64-bit shift, CFB with 1-bit shift, CFB with 8-bit shift and OFB modes.

           None of these algorithms are provided by the OpenSSL default provider.  To use them it is necessary to load either the OpenSSL legacy provider or another implementation.

       EVP_des_ede(), EVP_des_ede_cbc(), EVP_des_ede_cfb(), EVP_des_ede_cfb64(), EVP_des_ede_ecb(), EVP_des_ede_ofb()
           Two key triple DES in ECB, CBC, CFB with 64-bit shift and OFB modes.

       EVP_des_ede3(), EVP_des_ede3_cbc(), EVP_des_ede3_cfb(), EVP_des_ede3_cfb1(), EVP_des_ede3_cfb8(), EVP_des_ede3_cfb64(), EVP_des_ede3_ecb(), EVP_des_ede3_ofb()
           Three-key triple DES in ECB, CBC, CFB with 64-bit shift, CFB with 1-bit shift, CFB with 8-bit shift and OFB modes.

       EVP_des_ede3_wrap()
           Triple-DES key wrap according to RFC 3217 Section 3.

RETURN VALUES
       These functions return an EVP_CIPHER structure that contains the implementation of the symmetric cipher. See EVP_CIPHER_meth_new(3) for details of the EVP_CIPHER structure.
