POSIX_TRACE_GET_ATTR(3P)   POSIX Programmer's Manual  POSIX_TRACE_GET_ATTR(3P)

PROLOG
       This  manual  page is part of the POSIX Programmer's Manual.  The Linux
       implementation of this interface may differ (consult the  corresponding
       Linux  manual page for details of Linux behavior), or the interface may
       not be implemented on Linux.

NAME
       posix_trace_get_attr, posix_trace_get_status — retrieve the  trace  at‐
       tributes or trace status (TRACING)

SYNOPSIS
       #include <trace.h>

       int posix_trace_get_attr(trace_id_t trid, trace_attr_t *attr);
       int posix_trace_get_status(trace_id_t trid,
           struct posix_trace_status_info *statusinfo);

DESCRIPTION
       The  posix_trace_get_attr()  function  shall copy the attributes of the
       active trace stream identified by trid into the object  pointed  to  by
       the attr argument.  If the Trace Log option is supported, trid may rep‐
       resent a pre-recorded trace log.

       The posix_trace_get_status() function shall return,  in  the  structure
       pointed to by the statusinfo argument, the current trace status for the
       trace stream identified by the trid argument. These status  values  re‐
       turned in the structure pointed to by statusinfo shall have been appro‐
       priately read to ensure that the returned values  are  consistent.   If
       the  Trace  Log  option  is supported and the trid argument refers to a
       pre-recorded trace stream, the status shall be the status of  the  com‐
       pleted trace stream.

       Each  time  the  posix_trace_get_status() function is used, the overrun
       status of the trace stream shall be reset to POSIX_TRACE_NO_OVERRUN im‐
       mediately  after  the  call completes.  If the Trace Log option is sup‐
       ported, the posix_trace_get_status() function shall behave the same  as
       when the option is not supported except for the following differences:

        *  If  the  trid argument refers to a trace stream with log, each time
           the posix_trace_get_status() function is used, the log overrun sta‐
           tus  of  the  trace stream shall be reset to POSIX_TRACE_NO_OVERRUN
           and the flush_error status shall be reset to zero immediately after
           the call completes.

        *  If  the  trid  argument  refers to a pre-recorded trace stream, the
           status returned shall be the status of the completed  trace  stream
           and the status values of the trace stream shall not be reset.

RETURN VALUE
       Upon  successful  completion,  these  functions shall return a value of
       zero. Otherwise, they shall return the corresponding error number.

       The posix_trace_get_attr() function stores the trace attributes in  the
       object pointed to by attr, if successful.

       The  posix_trace_get_status()  function  stores the trace status in the
       object pointed to by statusinfo, if successful.

ERRORS
       These functions shall fail if:

       EINVAL The trace stream argument trid does not correspond  to  a  valid
              active trace stream or a valid trace log.

FUTURE DIRECTIONS

       be removed in a future version.
