NAME
       gnutls_session_get_id - API function

SYNOPSIS
       #include <gnutls/gnutls.h>

       int gnutls_session_get_id(gnutls_session_t session, void * session_id, size_t * session_id_size);

ARGUMENTS
       gnutls_session_t session
                   is a gnutls_session_t type.

       void * session_id
                   is a pointer to space to hold the session id.

       size_t * session_id_size
                   initially should contain the maximum  session_id size and will be updated.

DESCRIPTION
       Returns the TLS session identifier. The session ID is selected by the server, and in older versions of TLS was a unique identifier shared between client and server which was persistent across re‐
       sumption.  In the latest version of TLS (1.3) or TLS with session tickets, the notion of session identifiers is undefined and cannot be relied for uniquely identifying sessions across client  and
       server.

       In client side this function returns the identifier returned by the server, and cannot be assumed to have any relation to session resumption.  In server side this function is guaranteed to return
       a persistent identifier of the session since GnuTLS 3.6.4, which may not necessarily map into the TLS session ID value. Prior to that version the value could only be considered a persistent iden‐
       tifier, under TLS1.2 or earlier and when no session tickets were in use.

       The session identifier value returned is always less than GNUTLS_MAX_SESSION_ID_SIZE.

RETURNS
       On success, GNUTLS_E_SUCCESS (0) is returned, otherwise an error code is returned.
