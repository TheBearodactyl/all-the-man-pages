   Event datastructure
       typedef struct xcb_unmap_notify_event_t {
           uint8_t      response_type;
           uint8_t      pad0;
           uint16_t     sequence;
           xcb_window_t event;

EVENT FIELDS
       response_type
                 The type of this event, in this case XCB_UNMAP_NOTIFY. This field is also present in the xcb_generic_event_t and can be used to tell events apart from each other.

       sequence  The sequence number of the last request processed by the X11 server.

       event     The reconfigured window or its parent, depending on whether StructureNotify or SubstructureNotify was selected.

       window    The window that was unmapped.

       from_configure
                 Set to 1 if the event was generated as a result of a resizing of the window's parent when window had a win_gravity of UnmapGravity.
