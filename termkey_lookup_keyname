NAME
       termkey_lookup_keyname - look up a symbolic key value for a string name

SYNOPSIS
       #include <termkey.h>

       char *termkey_lookup_keyname(TermKey *tk, const char *keyname,
                  TermKeySym *sym);

       Link with -ltermkey.

DESCRIPTION
       termkey_lookup_keyname() looks up the symbolic key value represented by the given string name. This is a case-sensitive comparison. The symbolic value is written to the variable addressed by sym.
       This function is a more general form of termkey_keyname2sym(3) because it can recognise a symbolic key name within a longer string, returning a pointer to the remainder of the input after the key
       name.

       Because  the  key names are stored in an array indexed by the symbol number, this function has to perform a linear search of the names. Use of this function should be restricted to converting key
       names into symbolic values during a program's initialisation, so that efficient comparisons can be done while it is running.

RETURN VALUE
       termkey_lookup_keyname() returns a pointer to the first character after a recognised name, or NULL if the string does not begin with the name of a recognised symbolic key.
