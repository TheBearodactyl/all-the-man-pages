NAME
       ares_mkquery - Compose a single-question DNS query buffer

SYNOPSIS
       #include <ares.h>

       int ares_mkquery(const char *name, int dnsclass, int type,
                        unsigned short id, int rd, unsigned char **buf,
                        int *buflen)

DESCRIPTION
       Deprecated function. See ares_create_query(3) instead!

       The  ares_mkquery  function  composes a DNS query with a single question.  The parameter name gives the query name as a NUL-terminated C string of period-separated labels optionally ending with a
       period; periods and backslashes within a label must be escaped with a backlash.  The  parameters  dnsclass  and  type  give  the  class  and  type  of  the  query  using  the  values  defined  in
       <arpa/nameser.h>.   The  parameter  id gives a 16-bit identifier for the query.  The parameter rd should be nonzero if recursion is desired, zero if not.  The query will be placed in an allocated
       buffer, a pointer to which will be stored in the variable pointed to by buf, and the length of which will be stored in the variable pointed to by buflen.  It is  the  caller's  responsibility  to
       free this buffer using ares_free_string(3) when it is no longer needed.

       Usage of ares_mkquery(3) is deprecated, whereas the function is equivalent to ares_create_query(3) with max_udp_size set to 0.

RETURN VALUES
       ares_mkquery can return any of the following values:

       ARES_SUCCESS   Construction of the DNS query succeeded.

       ARES_ENOTFOUND The query name name refers to a .onion domain name. See RFC 7686.

       ARES_EBADNAME  The query name name could not be encoded as a domain name, either because it contained a zero-length label or because it contained a label of more than 63 characters.

       ARES_ENOMEM    Memory was exhausted.
