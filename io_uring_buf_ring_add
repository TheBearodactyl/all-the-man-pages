NAME
       io_uring_buf_ring_add - add buffers to a shared buffer ring

SYNOPSIS
       #include <liburing.h>

       int io_uring_buf_ring_add(struct io_uring_buf_ring *br,
                                 void *addr,
                                 unsigned int len,
                                 unsigned short bid,
                                 int mask,
                                 int buf_offset);

DESCRIPTION
       The  io_uring_buf_ring_add(3) adds a new buffer to the shared buffer ring br.  The buffer address is indicated by addr and is of len bytes of length.  bid is the buffer ID, which will be returned
       in the CQE.  mask is the size mask of the ring, available from io_uring_buf_ring_mask(3).  buf_offset is the offset to insert at from the current tail. If just one buffer is provided  before  the
       ring  tail is committed with io_uring_buf_ring_advance(3) or io_uring_buf_ring_cq_advance(3), then buf_offset should be 0. If buffers are provided in a loop before being committed, the buf_offset
       must be incremented by one for each buffer added.

RETURN VALUE
       None
