NAME
       gnutls_digest_set_secure - API function

SYNOPSIS
       #include <gnutls/gnutls.h>

       int gnutls_digest_set_secure(gnutls_digest_algorithm_t dig, unsigned int secure);

ARGUMENTS
       gnutls_digest_algorithm_t dig
                   is a digest algorithm

       unsigned int secure
                   whether to mark the digest algorithm secure

DESCRIPTION
       Modify the previous system wide setting that marked  dig as secure or insecure. This only has effect when the algorithm is enabled through the allowlisting mode in the configuration file, or when
