NAME
       gnutls_x509_crt_list_verify - API function

SYNOPSIS
       #include <gnutls/x509.h>

       int gnutls_x509_crt_list_verify(const gnutls_x509_crt_t * cert_list, unsigned cert_list_length, const gnutls_x509_crt_t * CA_list, unsigned CA_list_length, const gnutls_x509_crl_t * CRL_list, un‐
       signed CRL_list_length, unsigned int flags, unsigned int * verify);

ARGUMENTS
       const gnutls_x509_crt_t * cert_list
                   is the certificate list to be verified

       unsigned cert_list_length
                   holds the number of certificate in cert_list

       const gnutls_x509_crt_t * CA_list
                   is the CA list which will be used in verification

       unsigned CA_list_length
                   holds the number of CA certificate in CA_list

       const gnutls_x509_crl_t * CRL_list
                   holds a list of CRLs.

       unsigned CRL_list_length
                   the length of CRL list.

       unsigned int flags
                   Flags that may be used to change the verification algorithm. Use OR of the gnutls_certificate_verify_flags enumerations.

       unsigned int * verify
                   will hold the certificate verification output.

DESCRIPTION
       This function will try to verify the given certificate list and return its status. The details of the verification are the same as in gnutls_x509_trust_list_verify_crt2().

       You must check the peer's name in order to check if the verified certificate belongs to the actual peer.

       The certificate verification output will be put in  verify and will be one or more of the gnutls_certificate_status_t enumerated elements bitwise or'd.  For a more  detailed  verification  status
       use gnutls_x509_crt_verify() per list element.

RETURNS
       On success, GNUTLS_E_SUCCESS (0) is returned, otherwise a negative error value.
