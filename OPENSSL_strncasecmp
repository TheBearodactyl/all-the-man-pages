OPENSSL_STRCASECMP(3ssl)            OpenSSL           OPENSSL_STRCASECMP(3ssl)

NAME
       OPENSSL_strcasecmp, OPENSSL_strncasecmp - compare two strings ignoring
       case

SYNOPSIS
        #include <openssl/crypto.h>

        int OPENSSL_strcasecmp(const char *s1, const char *s2);
        int OPENSSL_strncasecmp(const char *s1, const char *s2, size_t n);

DESCRIPTION
       The OPENSSL_strcasecmp function performs a byte-by-byte comparison of
       the strings s1 and s2, ignoring the case of the characters.

       The OPENSSL_strncasecmp function is similar, except that it compares no
       more than n bytes of s1 and s2.

       In POSIX-compatible system and on Windows these functions use "C"
       locale for case insensitive. Otherwise the comparison is done in
       current locale.

RETURN VALUES
       Both functions return an integer less than, equal to, or greater than
       zero if s1 is found, respectively, to be less than, to match, or be
       greater than s2.

NOTES
       OpenSSL extensively uses case insensitive comparison of ASCII strings.
       Though OpenSSL itself is locale-agnostic, the applications using
       OpenSSL libraries may unpredictably suffer when they use localization
       (e.g. Turkish locale is well-known with a specific I/i cases). These
       functions use C locale for string comparison.
