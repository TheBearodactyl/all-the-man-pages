NAME
       unw_flush_cache -- flush cached info

SYNOPSIS
       #include <libunwind.h>

       void unw_flush_cache(unw_addr_space_t as, unw_word_t lo, unw_word_t hi);

DESCRIPTION
       The  unw_flush_cache()  routine  flushes all cached info as it relates to address-range lo to hi (non-inclusive) in the target address-space as.  In addition, all info cached for address-space as
       that is not tied to a particular code-range is also flushed. For example, the address of the dynamic registration list is not tied to a code-range and its cached value (if any) is  flushed  by  a
       call  to  this  routine.  The  address  range  specified  by lo and hi should be understood as a hint: unw_flush_cache() may flush more information than requested, but never less. In other words,
       unw_flush_cache() may overflush, but not underflush.

       As a special case, if arguments lo and hi are both 0, all information cached on behalf of address space as is flushed.

RETURN VALUE
       The unw_flush_cache() routine cannot fail and does not return a value.

THREAD AND SIGNAL SAFETY
       The unw_flush_cache() routine is thread-safe as well as safe to use from a signal handler.
