Pod::Perldoc::ToText(3pPerl Programmers Reference GPod::Perldoc::ToText(3perl)

NAME
       Pod::Perldoc::ToText - let Perldoc render Pod as plaintext

SYNOPSIS
         perldoc -o text Some::Modulename

DESCRIPTION
       This is a "plug-in" class that allows Perldoc to use Pod::Text as a
       formatter class.

       It supports the following options, which are explained in Pod::Text:
       alt, indent, loose, quotes, sentence, width

       For example:

         perldoc -o text -w indent:5 Some::Modulename

CAVEAT
       This module may change to use a different text formatter class in the
       future, and this may change what options are supported.
