NAME
       autodie::Scope::GuardStack -  Hook stack for managing scopes via %^H

SYNOPSIS
           use autodie::Scope::GuardStack;
           my $stack = autodie::Scope::GuardStack->new
           $^H{'my-key'} = $stack;

           $stack->push_hook(sub {});

DESCRIPTION
       This class is a stack of hooks to be called in the right order as scopes go away.  The stack is only useful when inserted into "%^H" and will pop hooks as their "scope" is popped.  This is useful
       for uninstalling or reinstalling subs in a namespace as a pragma goes out of scope.

       Due to how "%^H" works, this class is only useful during the compilation phase of a perl module and relies on the internals of how perl handles references in "%^H".  This module is not a part of
       autodie's public API.

   Methods
       new

         my $stack = autodie::Scope::GuardStack->new;

       Creates a new "autodie::Scope::GuardStack".  The stack is initially empty and must be inserted into "%^H" by the creator.

       push_hook

         $stack->push_hook(sub {});

       Add a sub to the stack.  The sub will be called once the current compile-time "scope" is left.  Multiple hooks can be added per scope
