NAME
       gnutls_dtls_set_mtu - API function

SYNOPSIS
       #include <gnutls/dtls.h>

       void gnutls_dtls_set_mtu(gnutls_session_t session, unsigned int mtu);

ARGUMENTS
       gnutls_session_t session
                   is a gnutls_session_t type.

       unsigned int mtu
                   The maximum transfer unit of the transport

DESCRIPTION
       This function will set the maximum transfer unit of the transport that DTLS packets are sent over. Note that this should exclude the IP (or IPv6) and UDP headers. So for DTLS over IPv6 on an Eth‐
       ernet device with MTU 1500, the DTLS MTU set with this function would be 1500 - 40 (IPV6 header) - 8 (UDP header) = 1452.

SINCE
       3.0
