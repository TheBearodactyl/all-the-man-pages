NAME
       XkbGetKeyTypes - Obtain the list of available key types in the server's keyboard mapping

SYNOPSIS
       Status XkbGetKeyTypes (Display *dpy, unsigned int first, unsigned int num, XkbDescPtr xkb);

ARGUMENTS
       dpy    connection to X server

       first  index to first type to get, 0 => 1st type

       num    number of key types to be returned

       xkb    keyboard description containing client map to update

DESCRIPTION
       XkbGetKeyTypes queries the server for the desired types, waits for a reply, and returns the desired types in the xkb->map->types.  If successful, it returns Success.

       XkbGetKeyTypes returns BadAccess if the Xkb extension has not been properly initialized and BadValue if the combination of first and num results in numbers out of valid range.

       NOTE:  XkbGetKeyTypes  is  used  to  obtain  descriptions of the key types themselves, not the key types bound to individual keys. To obtain the key types bound to an individual key, refer to the
       key_sym_map field of the client map.

DIAGNOSTICS
       BadAccess      The Xkb extension has not been properly initialized

       BadValue       An argument is out of range
