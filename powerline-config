DESCRIPTION
       -p, --config-path PATH

   Arguments specific to tmux subcommand
       ACTION If  action  is  source  then version-specific tmux configuration
              files are sourced, if it is setenv then special  (prefixed  with
              _POWERLINE)  tmux  global  environment variables are filled with
              data from powerline configuration. Action setup  is  just  doing
              setenv then source.

       -s, --source
              When using setup: always use configuration file sourcing. By de‐
              fault this is determined automatically based  on  tmux  version:
              this is the default for tmux 1.8 and below.

       -n, --no-source
              When using setup: in place of sourcing directly execute configu‐
              ration files. That is, read each needed powerline-specific  con‐
              figuration  file, substitute $_POWERLINE_… variables with appro‐
              priate values and run tmux config line. This is the default  be‐
              haviour for tmux 1.9 and above.
