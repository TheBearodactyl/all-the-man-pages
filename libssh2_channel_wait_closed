NAME
       libssh2_channel_wait_closed - wait for the remote to close the channel

SYNOPSIS
       #include <libssh2.h>

       int libssh2_channel_wait_closed(LIBSSH2_CHANNEL *channel);

DESCRIPTION
       Enter a temporary blocking state until the remote host closes the named channel. Typically sent after libssh2_channel_close(3) in order to examine the exit status.

RETURN VALUE
       Return 0 on success or negative on failure. It returns LIBSSH2_ERROR_EAGAIN when it would otherwise block. While LIBSSH2_ERROR_EAGAIN is a negative number, it isn't really a failure per se.
