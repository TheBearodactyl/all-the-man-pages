NAME
       EVP_chacha20, EVP_chacha20_poly1305 - EVP ChaCha20 stream cipher

SYNOPSIS
        #include <openssl/evp.h>

        const EVP_CIPHER *EVP_chacha20(void);
        const EVP_CIPHER *EVP_chacha20_poly1305(void);

DESCRIPTION
       The ChaCha20 stream cipher for EVP.

       EVP_chacha20()
           The ChaCha20 stream cipher. The key length is 256 bits, the IV is 128 bits long.  The first 32 bits consists of a counter in little-endian order followed by a 96 bit nonce. For example a
           nonce of:

           000000000000000000000002

           With an initial counter of 42 (2a in hex) would be expressed as:

           2a000000000000000000000000000002

       EVP_chacha20_poly1305()
           Authenticated encryption with ChaCha20-Poly1305. Like EVP_chacha20(), the key is 256 bits and the IV is 96 bits. This supports additional authenticated data (AAD) and produces a 128-bit
           authentication tag. See the "AEAD Interface" in EVP_EncryptInit(3) section for more information.

RETURN VALUES
       These functions return an EVP_CIPHER structure that contains the implementation of the symmetric cipher. See EVP_CIPHER_meth_new(3) for details of the EVP_CIPHER structure.
