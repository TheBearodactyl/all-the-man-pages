NAME
       CMS_EncryptedData_decrypt - Decrypt CMS EncryptedData

SYNOPSIS
        #include <openssl/cms.h>

        int CMS_EncryptedData_decrypt(CMS_ContentInfo *cms,
                                      const unsigned char *key, size_t keylen,
                                      BIO *dcont, BIO *out, unsigned int flags);

DESCRIPTION
       CMS_EncryptedData_decrypt() decrypts a cms EncryptedData object using the symmetric key of size keylen bytes. out is a BIO to write the content to and flags is an optional set of flags.  dcont is
       used in the rare case where the encrypted content is detached. It will normally be set to NULL.

       The following flags can be passed in the flags parameter.
