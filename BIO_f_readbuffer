BIO_F_READBUFFER(3ssl)              OpenSSL             BIO_F_READBUFFER(3ssl)

NAME
       BIO_f_readbuffer - read only buffering BIO that supports BIO_tell() and
       BIO_seek()

SYNOPSIS
        #include <openssl/bio.h>

        const BIO_METHOD *BIO_f_readbuffer(void);

DESCRIPTION
       BIO_f_readbuffer() returns the read buffering BIO method.

       This BIO filter can be inserted on top of BIO's that do not support
       BIO_tell() or BIO_seek() (e.g. A file BIO that uses stdin).

       Data read from a read buffering BIO comes from an internal buffer which
       is filled from the next BIO in the chain.

       BIO_gets() is supported for read buffering BIOs.  Writing data to a
       read buffering BIO is not supported.

       Calling BIO_reset() on a read buffering BIO does not clear any buffered
       data.

NOTES
       Read buffering BIOs implement BIO_read_ex() by using BIO_read_ex()
       operations on the next BIO (e.g. a file BIO) in the chain and storing
       the result in an internal buffer, from which bytes are given back to
       the caller as appropriate for the call. BIO_read_ex() is guaranteed to
       give the caller the number of bytes it asks for, unless there's an
       error or end of communication is reached in the next BIO. The internal
       buffer can grow to cache the entire contents of the next BIO in the
       chain. BIO_seek() uses the internal buffer, so that it can only seek
       into data that is already read.

RETURN VALUES
       BIO_f_readbuffer() returns the read buffering BIO method.
