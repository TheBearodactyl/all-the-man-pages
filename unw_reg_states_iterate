UNW_REG_STATES_ITERATE(3)                                                                  Programming Library                                                                   UNW_REG_STATES_ITERATE(3)

NAME
       unw_reg_states_iterate -- get register state info on current procedure

SYNOPSIS
       #include <libunwind.h>

       int unw_reg_states_iterate(unw_cursor_t *cp, unw_reg_states_callbackcb, void *token);

DESCRIPTION
       The  unw_reg_states_iterate()  routine  provides  information  about  the  procedure  that  created  the stack frame identified by argument cp.  The cb argument is a pointer to a function of type
       unw_reg_states_callback which is used to return the information. The function unw_reg_states_callback has the following definition:

       int ( *unw_reg_states_callback)(void *token, void *reg_states_data, size_t reg_states_data_size, unw_word_t start_ip, unw_word_t end_ip);

       The callback function may be invoked several times for each call of unw_reg_states_iterate.  Each call is associcated with a instruction address range and a set of instructions on how  to  update
       register values when returning from the procedure in that address range. For each invocation, the arguments to the callback function are:

       void * token
               The token value passed to unw_reg_states_callback.

       void * reg_states_data
               A pointer to data about updating register values. This data, or a copy of it, can be passed to unw_apply_reg_state.

       int reg_states_data_size
               The size of the register update data.

       unw_word_t start_ip
               The address of the first instruction of the address range.

       unw_word_t end_ip
               The address of the first instruction beyond the end of the address range.

RETURN VALUE
       On successful completion, unw_reg_states_iterate() returns 0. If the callback function returns a nonzero value, that indicates failure and the function returns immediately. Otherwise the negative
       value of one of the error-codes below is returned.

THREAD AND SIGNAL SAFETY
       unw_reg_states_iterate() is thread-safe. If cursor cp is in the local address-space, this routine is also safe to use from a signal handler.

ERRORS
       UNW_EUNSPEC
               An unspecified error occurred.

       UNW_ENOINFO
               Libunwind was unable to locate unwind-info for the procedure.

       UNW_EBADVERSION
               The unwind-info for the procedure has version or format that is not understood by libunwind.

       In addition, unw_reg_states_iterate() may return any error returned by the access_mem() call-back (see unw_create_addr_space(3)).
