NAME
       CURLOPT_TIMECONDITION - select condition for a time request

SYNOPSIS
       #include <curl/curl.h>

       CURLcode curl_easy_setopt(CURL *handle, CURLOPT_TIMECONDITION, long cond);

DESCRIPTION
       Pass a long as parameter. This defines how the CURLOPT_TIMEVALUE(3) time value is treated. You can set this parameter to CURL_TIMECOND_IFMODSINCE or CURL_TIMECOND_IFUNMODSINCE.

       The last modification time of a file is not always known and in such instances this feature will have no effect even if the given time condition would not have been met. curl_easy_getinfo(3) with
       the CURLINFO_CONDITION_UNMET option can be used after a transfer to learn if a zero-byte successful "transfer" was due to this condition not matching.

DEFAULT
       CURL_TIMECOND_NONE (0)

PROTOCOLS
       HTTP, FTP, RTSP, and FILE

EXAMPLE
       CURL *curl = curl_easy_init();
       if(curl) {
         curl_easy_setopt(curl, CURLOPT_URL, "https://example.com");

         /* January 1, 2020 is 1577833200 */
         curl_easy_setopt(curl, CURLOPT_TIMEVALUE, 1577833200L);

         /* If-Modified-Since the above time stamp */
         curl_easy_setopt(curl, CURLOPT_TIMECONDITION,
                          (long)CURL_TIMECOND_IFMODSINCE);

         /* Perform the request */
         curl_easy_perform(curl);
       }
