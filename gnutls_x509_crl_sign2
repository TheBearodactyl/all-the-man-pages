NAME
       gnutls_x509_crl_sign2 - API function

SYNOPSIS
       #include <gnutls/x509.h>

       int gnutls_x509_crl_sign2(gnutls_x509_crl_t crl, gnutls_x509_crt_t issuer, gnutls_x509_privkey_t issuer_key, gnutls_digest_algorithm_t dig, unsigned int flags);

ARGUMENTS
       gnutls_x509_crl_t crl
                   should contain a gnutls_x509_crl_t type

       gnutls_x509_crt_t issuer
                   is the certificate of the certificate issuer

       gnutls_x509_privkey_t issuer_key
                   holds the issuer's private key

       gnutls_digest_algorithm_t dig
                   The message digest to use. GNUTLS_DIG_SHA256 is the safe choice unless you know what you're doing.

       unsigned int flags
                   must be 0

DESCRIPTION
       This function will sign the CRL with the issuer's private key, and will copy the issuer's information into the CRL.

       This must be the last step in a certificate CRL since all the previously set parameters are now signed.

       A known limitation of this function is, that a newly-signed CRL will not be fully functional (e.g., for signature verification), until it is exported an re-imported.

       After GnuTLS 3.6.1 the value of  dig may be GNUTLS_DIG_UNKNOWN, and in that case, a suitable but reasonable for the key algorithm will be selected.

RETURNS
       On success, GNUTLS_E_SUCCESS (0) is returned, otherwise a negative error value.
