NAME
       ares_parse_naptr_reply - Parse a reply to a DNS query of type NAPTR

SYNOPSIS
       #include <ares.h>

       int ares_parse_naptr_reply(const unsigned char* abuf, int alen,
                                  struct ares_naptr_reply** naptr_out);

DESCRIPTION
       The ares_parse_naptr_reply function parses the response to a query of type NAPTR into a linked list of struct ares_naptr_reply The parameters abuf and alen give the contents of the response.  The
       result is stored in allocated memory and a pointer to it stored into the variable pointed to by naptr_out.  It is the caller's responsibility to free the resulting naptr_out structure when it  is
       no longer needed using the function ares_free_data

       The structure ares_naptr_reply contains the following fields:

           struct ares_naptr_reply {
               struct ares_naptr_reply *next;
               unsigned char *flags;
               unsigned char *service;
               unsigned char *regexp;
               char *replacement;
               unsigned short order;
               unsigned short preference;
           };

RETURN VALUES
       ares_parse_naptr_reply can return any of the following values:

       ARES_SUCCESS   The response was successfully parsed.

       ARES_EBADRESP  The response was malformatted.

       ARES_ENODATA   The response did not contain an answer to the query.

       ARES_ENOMEM    Memory was exhausted.
