swab(3)                    Library Functions Manual                    swab(3)

NAME
       swab - swap adjacent bytes

LIBRARY
       Standard C library (libc, -lc)

SYNOPSIS
       #define _XOPEN_SOURCE       /* See feature_test_macros(7) */
       #include <unistd.h>

       void swab(const void from[restrict .n], void to[restrict .n],
                 ssize_t n);

DESCRIPTION
       The swab() function copies n bytes from the array pointed to by from to
       the array pointed to by to, exchanging adjacent  even  and  odd  bytes.
       This  function is used to exchange data between machines that have dif‐
       ferent low/high byte ordering.

       This function does nothing when n is negative.  When n is positive  and
       odd, it handles n-1 bytes as above, and does something unspecified with
       the last byte.  (In other words, n should be even.)

RETURN VALUE
       The swab() function returns no value.

PROLOG
       This  manual  page is part of the POSIX Programmer's Manual.  The Linux
       implementation of this interface may differ (consult the  corresponding
       Linux  manual page for details of Linux behavior), or the interface may
       not be implemented on Linux.

NAME
       swab — swap bytes

SYNOPSIS
       #include <unistd.h>

       void swab(const void *restrict src, void *restrict dest,
           ssize_t nbytes);

DESCRIPTION
       The swab() function shall copy nbytes bytes, which are  pointed  to  by
       src,  to  the object pointed to by dest, exchanging adjacent bytes. The
       nbytes argument should be even. If nbytes is odd, swab() copies and ex‐
       changes nbytes-1 bytes and the disposition of the last byte is unspeci‐
       fied. If copying takes place between objects that overlap, the behavior
       is undefined.  If nbytes is negative, swab() does nothing.

RETURN VALUE
       None.
