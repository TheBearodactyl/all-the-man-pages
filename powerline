POWERLINE(1)                       Powerline                      POWERLINE(1)

NAME
       powerline - Powerline prompt and statusline script.

SYNOPSIS
          powerline EXT [SIDE] [-rMODULE] [-wWIDTH] [--last-exit-code=INT]
                    [--last-pipe-status=LIST] [--jobnum=INT]
                    [-cKEY.KEY=VALUE]… [-tTHEME.KEY.KEY=VALUE]… [-RKEY=VAL]…
                    [-pPATH]… [--socket=ADDRESS]

DESCRIPTION
       EXT    Extension:  application  for which powerline command is launched
              (usually shell or tmux). Also supports wm.  extensions:  wm.awe‐
              some.

       SIDE   Side: left and right represent left and right side respectively,
              above emits lines that are supposed to be printed just above the
              prompt  and aboveleft is like concatenating above with left with
              the exception that only one Python  instance  is  used  in  this
              case. May be omitted for wm.* extensions.

       -r, --renderer-module MODULE
              Renderer  module.  Usually  something  like  .bash or .zsh (with
              leading dot)  which  is  powerline.renderers.{ext}{MODULE},  may
              also  be  full module name (must contain at least one dot or end
              with a dot in case it is top-level module) or  powerline.render‐
              ers submodule (in case there are no dots).

       -w, --width WIDTH
              Maximum prompt with. Triggers truncation of some segments.

       --last-exit-code INT
              Last exit code.

       --last-pipe-status LIST
              Like  above, but is supposed to contain space-separated array of
              statuses, representing exit statuses of commands in one pipe.

       --jobnum INT
              Number of jobs.

       -c, --config-override KEY.KEY=VALUE
              Configuration overrides for config.json. Is translated to a dic‐
              tionary and merged with the dictionary obtained from actual JSON
              configuration: KEY.KEY=VALUE is translated  to  {"KEY":  {"KEY":
              VALUE}}  and  then  merged  recursively.  VALUE  may be any JSON
              value, values that are not null, true, false, start with  digit,
              {,  [  are treated like strings. If VALUE is omitted then corre‐
              sponding key is removed.

       -t, --theme-override THEME.KEY.KEY=VALUE
              Like above, but theme-specific. THEME should point to an  exist‐
              ing and used theme to have any effect, but it is fine to use any
              theme here.

       -R, --renderer-arg KEY=VAL
              Like above, but provides argument for renderer. Is  supposed  to
              be  used  only  by  shell  bindings to provide various data like
              last-exit-code or last-pipe-status (they are  not  using  --ren‐
              derer-arg  for  historical  reasons:  --renderer-arg  was  added
              later).

       -p, --config-path PATH
              Path to configuration directory. If it is present then  configu‐
              ration  files  will  only be sought in the provided path. May be
              provided multiple times to search in a list of directories.

       --socket ADDRESS
              Socket address to use in daemon clients. Is always  UNIX  domain
              socket  on  linux  and  file  socket on Mac OS X. Not used here,
              present only for compatibility  with  other  powerline  clients.
              This  argument  must  always  be  the first one and be in a form
              --socket ADDRESS: no = or short form allowed (in other powerline
              clients, not here).

       -h, --help
              Display help and exit.
