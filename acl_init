NAME
     acl_init — initialize ACL working storage

LIBRARY
     Linux Access Control Lists library (libacl, -lacl).

SYNOPSIS
     #include <sys/types.h>
     #include <sys/acl.h>

     acl_t
     acl_init(int count);

DESCRIPTION
     The acl_init() function allocates and initializes the working storage for an ACL of at least count ACL entries.  The ACL created initially contains no ACL entries.  A pointer to the working storage
     is returned.

     This function may cause memory to be allocated.  The caller should free any releasable memory, when the new ACL is no longer required, by calling acl_free(3) with the (void*)acl_t returned by
     acl_init() as an argument.

RETURN VALUE
     On success, this function returns a pointer to the working storage.  On error, a value of (acl_t)NULL is returned, and errno is set appropriately.

ERRORS
     If any of the following conditions occur, the acl_init() function returns a value of (acl_t)NULL and sets errno to the corresponding value:

     [EINVAL]           The value of count is less than zero.

     [ENOMEM]           The acl_t to be returned requires more memory than is allowed by the hardware or system-imposed memory management constraints.

STANDARDS
     IEEE Std 1003.1e draft 17 (“POSIX.1e”, abandoned)
