NAME
       TAP::Parser::Iterator::Stream - Iterator for filehandle-based TAP sources

VERSION
       Version 3.44

SYNOPSIS
         use TAP::Parser::Iterator::Stream;
         open( TEST, 'test.tap' );
         my $it   = TAP::Parser::Iterator::Stream->new(\*TEST);
         my $line = $it->next;

DESCRIPTION
       This is a simple iterator wrapper for reading from filehandles, used by TAP::Parser.  Unless you're writing a plugin or subclassing, you probably won't need to use this module directly.

METHODS
   Class Methods
       "new"

       Create an iterator.  Expects one argument containing a filehandle.

   Instance Methods
       "next"

       Iterate through it, of course.

       "next_raw"

       Iterate raw input without applying any fixes for quirky input syntax.

       "wait"

       Get the wait status for this iterator. Always returns zero.

       "exit"

       Get the exit status for this iterator. Always returns zero.
