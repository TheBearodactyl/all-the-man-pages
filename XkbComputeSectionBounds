NAME
       XkbComputeSectionBounds - Update the bounding box of a section

SYNOPSIS
       Bool XkbComputeSectionBounds (XkbGeometryPtr geom, XkbSectionPtr section);

ARGUMENTS
       geom   geometry that contains the section

       section
              section to be examined and updated

DESCRIPTION
        If you add or delete a row to or from a section, or if you change the geometry of any of the rows in that section, you may need to update the bounding box for that section.

       XkbComputeSectionBounds  examines all the rows of the section and updates the bounding box of that section so that it contains all rows.  XkbComputeSectionBounds returns False if any of the argu‚Äê
       ments is NULL; otherwise, it returns True.
