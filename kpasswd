NAME
       kpasswd - change a user's Kerberos password

SYNOPSIS
       kpasswd [principal]

DESCRIPTION
       The kpasswd command is used to change a Kerberos principal's password.  kpasswd first prompts for the current Kerberos password, then prompts the user twice for the new password, and the password
       is changed.

       If the principal is governed by a policy that specifies the length and/or number of character classes required in the new password, the new password must conform to the policy.  (The five charac‚Äê
       ter classes are lower case, upper case, numbers, punctuation, and all other characters.)

OPTIONS
       principal
              Change  the  password  for  the Kerberos principal principal.  Otherwise, kpasswd uses the principal name from an existing ccache if there is one; if not, the principal is derived from the
              identity of the user invoking the kpasswd command.

ENVIRONMENT
       See kerberos(7) for a description of Kerberos environment variables.
