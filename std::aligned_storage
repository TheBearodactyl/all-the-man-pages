NAME
       std::aligned_storage< _Len, _Align > - Alignment type.

SYNOPSIS
       Inherited by __gnu_cxx::__aligned_buffer< _Res >.

Detailed Description
   template<std::size_t _Len, std::size_t _Align = __alignof__(typename
       __aligned_storage_msa<_Len>::__type)>
       struct std::aligned_storage< _Len, _Align >"Alignment type.

       The value of _Align is a default-alignment which shall be the most
       stringent alignment requirement for any C++ object type whose size is
       no greater than _Len (3.9). The member typedef type shall be a POD type
       suitable for use as uninitialized storage for any object whose size is
       at most _Len and whose alignment is a divisor of _Align.
