NAME
       TIFFReadRawTile - return an undecoded tile of data from an open TIFF file

SYNOPSIS
          #include <tiffio.h>

       tsize_t TIFFReadRawTile(TIFF *tif, ttile_t tile, tdata_t buf, tsize_t size)

DESCRIPTION
       Read  the  contents  of the specified tile into the (user supplied) data buffer.  Note that the value of tile is a “raw tile number”. That is, the caller must take into account whether or not the
       data is organized in separate planes (PlanarConfiguration = 2).  TIFFComputeTile() automatically does this when converting an (x,y,z,sample) coordinate quadruple to a tile number. To read a  full
       tile of data the data buffer should typically be at least as large as the value returned by TIFFTileSize().

RETURN VALUES
       The actual number of bytes of data that were placed in buf is returned; TIFFReadRawTile() returns -1 if an error was encountered.

DIAGNOSTICS
       All error messages are directed to the TIFFErrorExtR() routine.
