NAME
       gnutls_pkcs12_bag_enc_info - API function

SYNOPSIS
       #include <gnutls/pkcs12.h>

       int gnutls_pkcs12_bag_enc_info(gnutls_pkcs12_bag_t bag, unsigned int * schema, unsigned int * cipher, void * salt, unsigned int * salt_size, unsigned int * iter_count, char ** oid);

ARGUMENTS
       gnutls_pkcs12_bag_t bag
                   The bag

       unsigned int * schema
                   indicate the schema as one of gnutls_pkcs_encrypt_flags_t

       unsigned int * cipher
                   the cipher used as gnutls_cipher_algorithm_t

       void * salt PBKDF2 salt (if non-NULL then  salt_size initially holds its size)

       unsigned int * salt_size
                   PBKDF2 salt size

       unsigned int * iter_count
                   PBKDF2 iteration count

       char ** oid if non-NULL it will contain an allocated null-terminated variable with the OID

DESCRIPTION
       This  function  will provide information on the encryption algorithms used in an encrypted bag. If the structure algorithms are unknown the code GNUTLS_E_UNKNOWN_CIPHER_TYPE will be returned, and
       only  oid , will be set. That is,  oid will be set on encrypted bags whether supported or not. It must be deinitialized using gnutls_free().  The other variables are only set on supported  struc‐
       tures.

RETURNS
       GNUTLS_E_INVALID_REQUEST if the provided bag isn't encrypted, GNUTLS_E_UNKNOWN_CIPHER_TYPE if the structure's encryption isn't supported, or another negative error code in case of a failure. Zero
       on success.
