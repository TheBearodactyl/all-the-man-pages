PROLOG
       This  manual  page is part of the POSIX Programmer's Manual.  The Linux implementation of this interface may differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for details of Linux behavior), or
       the interface may not be implemented on Linux.

NAME
       unalias — remove alias definitions

SYNOPSIS
       unalias alias-name...

       unalias -a

DESCRIPTION
       The unalias utility shall remove the definition for each alias name specified. See Section 2.3.1, Alias Substitution.  The aliases shall be removed from the current shell  execution  environment;
       see Section 2.12, Shell Execution Environment.

OPTIONS
       The unalias utility shall conform to the Base Definitions volume of POSIX.1‐2017, Section 12.2, Utility Syntax Guidelines.

       The following option shall be supported:

       -a        Remove all alias definitions from the current shell execution environment.

OPERANDS
       The following operand shall be supported:

       alias-name
                 The name of an alias to be removed.

STDIN
       Not used.

INPUT FILES
       None.

ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
       The following environment variables shall affect the execution of unalias:

       LANG      Provide  a default value for the internationalization variables that are unset or null. (See the Base Definitions volume of POSIX.1‐2017, Section 8.2, Internationalization Variables for
                 the precedence of internationalization variables used to determine the values of locale categories.)

       LC_ALL    If set to a non-empty string value, override the values of all the other internationalization variables.

       LC_CTYPE  Determine the locale for the interpretation of sequences of bytes of text data as characters (for example, single-byte as opposed to multi-byte characters in arguments).

       LC_MESSAGES
                 Determine the locale that should be used to affect the format and contents of diagnostic messages written to standard error.

       NLSPATH   Determine the location of message catalogs for the processing of LC_MESSAGES.

ASYNCHRONOUS EVENTS
       Default.

STDOUT
       Not used.

STDERR
       The standard error shall be used only for diagnostic messages.

OUTPUT FILES
       None.

EXTENDED DESCRIPTION
       None.

EXIT STATUS
       The following exit values shall be returned:

        0    Successful completion.

       >0    One of the alias-name operands specified did not represent a valid alias definition, or an error occurred.

CONSEQUENCES OF ERRORS
       Default.

       The following sections are informative.

APPLICATION USAGE
       Since unalias affects the current shell execution environment, it is generally provided as a shell regular built-in.

EXAMPLES
       None.

RATIONALE
       The unalias description is based on that from historical KornShell implementations.  Known differences exist between that and the C shell. The KornShell version was adopted to be consistent  with
       all the other KornShell features in this volume of POSIX.1‐2017, such as command line editing.

       The -a option is the equivalent of the unalias * form of the C shell and is provided to address security concerns about unknown aliases entering the environment of a user (or application) through
       the allowable implementation-defined predefined alias route or as a result of an ENV file. (Although unalias could be used to simplify the ``secure'' shell script shown in the command  rationale,
       it does not obviate the need to quote all command names. An initial call to unalias -a would have to be quoted in case there was an alias for unalias.)

FUTURE DIRECTIONS
       None.
