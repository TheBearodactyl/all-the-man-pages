NAME
       gnutls_record_send_file - API function

SYNOPSIS
       #include <gnutls/gnutls.h>

       ssize_t gnutls_record_send_file(gnutls_session_t session, int fd, off_t * offset, size_t count);

ARGUMENTS
       gnutls_session_t session
                   is a gnutls_session_t type.

       int fd      file descriptor from which to read data.

       off_t * offset
                   Is relative to file offset, denotes the starting location for reading.  after function returns, it point to position following last read byte.

       size_t count
                   is the length of the data in bytes to be read from file and send.

DESCRIPTION
       This  function  sends  data from  fd . If KTLS (kernel TLS) is enabled, it will use the sendfile() system call to avoid overhead of copying data between user space and the kernel. Otherwise, this
       functionality is merely emulated by calling read() and gnutls_record_send(). If this implementation is suboptimal, check whether KTLS is enabled using gnutls_transport_is_ktls_enabled().

       If  offset is NULL then file offset is incremented by number of bytes send, otherwise file offset remains unchanged.

RETURNS
       The number of bytes sent, or a negative error code.
