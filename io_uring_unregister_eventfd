NAME
       io_uring_register_eventfd - register an eventfd with a ring

SYNOPSIS
       #include <liburing.h>

       int io_uring_register_eventfd(struct io_uring *ring,
                                     int fd);

       int io_uring_register_eventfd_async(struct io_uring *ring,
                                           int fd);

       int io_uring_unregister_eventfd(struct io_uring *ring);

DESCRIPTION
       io_uring_register_eventfd(3) registers the eventfd file descriptor fd with the ring identified by ring.

       Whenever  completions  are posted to the CQ ring, an eventfd notification is generated with the registered eventfd descriptor. If io_uring_register_eventfd_async(3) is used, only events that com‚Äê
       pleted out-of-line will trigger a notification.

       It notifications are no longer desired, io_uring_unregister_eventfd(3) may be called to remove the eventfd registration. No eventfd argument is needed, as a ring can only have  a  single  eventfd
       registered.

NOTES
       While  io_uring  generally  takes  care  to avoid spurious events, they can occur.  Similarly, batched completions of CQEs may only trigger a single eventfd notification even if multiple CQEs are
       posted. The application should make no assumptions on number of events being available having a direct correlation to eventfd notifications posted. An  eventfd  notification  must  thus  only  be
       treated as a hint to check the CQ ring for completions.

RETURN VALUE
       Returns 0 on success, or or -errno on error.
