PCRE2_CODE_FREE(3)         Library Functions Manual         PCRE2_CODE_FREE(3)

NAME
       PCRE2 - Perl-compatible regular expressions (revised API)

SYNOPSIS

       #include <pcre2.h>

       void pcre2_code_free(pcre2_code *code);

DESCRIPTION

       If code is NULL, this function does nothing. Otherwise, code must point
       to a compiled pattern. This function frees its  memory,  including  any
       memory used by the JIT compiler. If the compiled pattern was created by
       a call to pcre2_code_copy_with_tables(), the memory for  the  character
       tables is also freed.

       There is a complete description of the PCRE2 native API in the pcre2api
       page and a description of the POSIX API in the pcre2posix page.
