NAME
       curl_easy_init - Start a libcurl easy session

SYNOPSIS
       #include <curl/curl.h>

       CURL *curl_easy_init();

DESCRIPTION
       This  function  must be the first function to call, and it returns a CURL easy handle that you must use as input to other functions in the easy interface. This call MUST have a corresponding call
       to curl_easy_cleanup(3) when the operation is complete.

       If you did not already call curl_global_init(3), curl_easy_init(3) does it automatically. This may be lethal in multi-threaded cases, since curl_global_init(3) is not thread-safe, and it may  re‚Äê
       sult in resource problems because there is no corresponding cleanup.

       You  are  strongly advised to not allow this automatic behavior, by calling curl_global_init(3) yourself properly. See the description in libcurl(3) of global environment requirements for details
       of how to use this function.

EXAMPLE
       CURL *curl = curl_easy_init();
       if(curl) {
         CURLcode res;
         curl_easy_setopt(curl, CURLOPT_URL, "https://example.com");
         res = curl_easy_perform(curl);
         curl_easy_cleanup(curl);
       }

AVAILABILITY
       Always

RETURN VALUE
       If this function returns NULL, something went wrong and you cannot use the other curl functions.
