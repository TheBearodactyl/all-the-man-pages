NAME
       ares_send - Initiate a DNS query

SYNOPSIS
       #include <ares.h>

       typedef void (*ares_callback)(void *arg, int status,
                                     int timeouts, unsigned char *abuf,
                                     int alen)

       void ares_send(ares_channel channel, const unsigned char *qbuf,
                      int qlen, ares_callback callback, void *arg)

DESCRIPTION
       The  ares_send function initiates a DNS query on the name service channel identified by channel.  The parameters qbuf and qlen give the DNS query, which should already have been formatted accord‐
       ing to the DNS protocol.  When the query is complete or has failed, the ares library will invoke callback.  Completion or failure of the query may happen immediately, or may happen during a later
       call to ares_process(3) or ares_destroy(3).

       The  callback  argument arg is copied from the ares_send argument arg.  The callback argument status indicates whether the query succeeded and, if not, how it failed.  It may have any of the fol‐
       lowing values:

       ARES_SUCCESS       The query completed.

       ARES_EBADQUERY     The query buffer was poorly formed (was not long enough for a DNS header or was too long for TCP transmission).

       ARES_ETIMEOUT      No name servers responded within the timeout period.

       ARES_ECONNREFUSED  No name servers could be contacted.

       ARES_ENOMEM        Memory was exhausted.

       ARES_ECANCELLED    The query was cancelled.

       ARES_EDESTRUCTION  The name service channel channel is being destroyed; the query will not be completed.

       The callback argument timeouts reports how many times a query timed out during the execution of the given request.

       If the query completed, the callback argument abuf points to a result buffer of length alen.  If the query did not complete, abuf will be NULL and alen will be 0.

       Unless the flag ARES_FLAG_NOCHECKRESP was set at channel initialization time, ares_send will normally ignore responses whose questions do not match the questions in qbuf,  as  well  as  responses
       with  reply  codes  of  SERVFAIL, NOTIMP, and REFUSED.  Unlike other query functions in the ares library, however, ares_send does not inspect the header of the reply packet to determine the error
       status, so a callback status of ARES_SUCCESS does not reflect as much about the response as for other query functions.
