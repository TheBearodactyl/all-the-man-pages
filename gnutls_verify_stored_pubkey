NAME
       gnutls_verify_stored_pubkey - API function

SYNOPSIS
       #include <gnutls/gnutls.h>

       int  gnutls_verify_stored_pubkey(const  char  *  db_name, gnutls_tdb_t tdb, const char * host, const char * service, gnutls_certificate_type_t cert_type, const gnutls_datum_t * cert, unsigned int
       flags);

ARGUMENTS
       const char * db_name
                   A file specifying the stored keys (use NULL for the default)

       gnutls_tdb_t tdb
                   A storage structure or NULL to use the default

       const char * host
                   The peer's name

       const char * service
                   non-NULL if this key is specific to a service (e.g. http)

       gnutls_certificate_type_t cert_type
                   The type of the certificate

       const gnutls_datum_t * cert
                   The raw (der) data of the certificate

       unsigned int flags
                   should be 0.

DESCRIPTION
       This function will try to verify a raw public-key or a public-key provided via a raw (DER-encoded) certificate using a list of stored public keys.  The  service field if non-NULL should be a port
       number.

       The   db_name  variable  if non-null specifies a custom backend for the retrieval of entries. If it is NULL then the default file backend will be used. In POSIX-like systems the file backend uses
       the $HOME/.gnutls/known_hosts file.

       Note that if the custom storage backend is provided  the  retrieval  function  should  return  GNUTLS_E_CERTIFICATE_KEY_MISMATCH  if  the  host/service  pair  is  found  but  key  doesn't  match,
       GNUTLS_E_NO_CERTIFICATE_FOUND if no such host/service with the given key is found, and 0 if it was found. The storage function should return 0 on success.

       As of GnuTLS 3.6.6 this function also verifies raw public keys.

RETURNS
       If  no  associated  public  key  is  found  then  GNUTLS_E_NO_CERTIFICATE_FOUND  will  be returned. If a key is found but does not match GNUTLS_E_CERTIFICATE_KEY_MISMATCH is returned. On success,
       GNUTLS_E_SUCCESS (0) is returned, or a negative error value on other errors.

SINCE
       3.0.13
