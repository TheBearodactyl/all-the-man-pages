NAME
       fd - find entries in the filesystem

SYNOPSIS
       fd [-HIEsiaLp0hV] [-d depth] [-t filetype] [-e ext] [-E exclude] [-c when] [-j num] [-x cmd] [pattern] [path...]

DESCRIPTION
       fd is a simple, fast and user-friendly alternative to find(1).

       By default fd uses regular expressions for the pattern. However, this can be changed to use simple glob patterns with the '--glob' option.

OPTIONS
       -H, --hidden
              Include hidden files and directories in the search results (default: hidden files and directories are skipped). The flag can be overridden with '--no-hidden'.

       -I, --no-ignore
              Show search results from files and directories that would otherwise be ignored by

              • .gitignore

              • .git/info/exclude

              • The global gitignore configuration (by default $HOME/.config/git/ignore)

              • .ignore

              • .fdignore

              • The global fd ignore file (usually $HOME/.config/fd/ignore )

              The flag can be overridden with '--ignore'.

       -u, --unrestricted
              Perform an unrestricted search, including ignored and hidden files. This is an alias for '--hidden --no-ignore'.

       --no-ignore-vcs
              Show  search results from files and directories that would otherwise be ignored by gitignore files including .gitignore, .git/info/exclude, and the global gitignore configuration (core.ex‐
              cludesFile git setting, which defaults to $HOME/.config/git/ignore).  The flag can be overridden with '--ignore-vcs'.

       --no-ignore-parent
              Show search results from files and directories that would otherwise be ignored by gitignore files in parent directories.

       -s, --case-sensitive
              Perform a case-sensitive search. By default, fd uses case-insensitive searches, unless the pattern contains an uppercase character (smart case).

       -i, --ignore-case
              Perform a case-insensitive search. By default, fd uses case-insensitive searches, unless the pattern contains an uppercase character (smart case).

       -g, --glob
              Perform a glob-based search instead of a regular expression search.  If combined with the '--full-path' option, '**' can be used to match multiple path components.

       --regex
              Perform a regular-expression based search (default). This can be used to override --glob.

       -F, --fixed-strings
              Treat the pattern as a literal string instead of a regular expression. Note that this also performs substring comparison. If you  want  to  match  on  an  exact  filename,  consider  using
              '--glob'.

       -a, --absolute-path
              Shows the full path starting from the root as opposed to relative paths.  The flag can be overridden with '--relative-path'.

       -l, --list-details
              Use  a  detailed  listing format like 'ls -l'. This is basically an alias for '--exec-batch ls -l' with some additional 'ls' options. This can be used to see more metadata, to show symlink
              targets and to achieve a deterministic sort order.

       -L, --follow
              By default, fd does not descend into symlinked directories. Using this flag, symbolic links are also traversed. The flag can be overridden with '--no-follow'.

       -p, --full-path
              By default, the search pattern is only matched against the filename (or directory name). Using this flag, the pattern is matched against the full path.

       -0, --print0
              Separate search results by the null character (instead of newlines). Useful for piping results to xargs.

       --max-results count
              Limit the number of search results to 'count' and quit immediately.

       -1     Limit the search to a single result and quit immediately. This is an alias for '--max-results=1'.

       -q, --quiet
              When the flag is present, the program does not print anything and will instead exit with a code of 0 if there is at least one search result.  Otherwise, the exit code will be 1.   This  is
              mainly for usage in scripts and can be faster than checking for output because the search can be stopped early after the first match.  --has-results can be used as an alias.

       --show-errors
              Enable the display of filesystem errors for situations such as insufficient permissions or dead symlinks.

       --strip-cwd-prefix
              By default, relative paths are prefixed with './' when the output goes to a non interactive terminal (TTY). Use this flag to disable this behaviour.

       --one-file-system, --mount, --xdev
              By  default, fd will traverse the file system tree as far as other options dictate. With this flag, fd ensures that it does not descend into a different file system than the one it started
              in. Comparable to the -mount or -xdev filters of find(1).

       -h, --help
              Print help information.

       -V, --version
              Print version information.

       -d, --max-depth d
              Limit directory traversal to at most d levels of depth. By default, there is no limit on the search depth.

       --min-depth d
              Only show search results starting at the given depth. See also: '--max-depth' and '--exact-depth'.

       --exact-depth d
              Only show search results at the exact given depth. This is an alias for '--min-depth <depth> --max-depth <depth>'.

       --prune
              Do not traverse into matching directories.

       -t, --type filetype
              Filter search by type:

              f, file
                     regular files

              d, directory
                     directories

              l, symlink
                     symbolic links

              s, socket
                     sockets

              p, pipe
                     named pipes (FIFOs)

              x, executable
                     executable (files)

              e, empty
                     empty files or directories

              This option can be specified more than once to include multiple file types.  Searching for '--type file --type symlink' will show both regular files as well as symlinks. Note that the 'ex‐
              ecutable'  and  'empty'  filters  work differently: '--type executable' implies '--type file' by default. And '--type empty' searches for empty files and directories, unless either '--type
              file' or '--type directory' is specified in addition.

              Examples:
                - Only search for files:
                    fd --type file …
                    fd -tf …
                - Find both files and symlinks
                    fd --type file --type symlink …
                    fd -tf -tl …
                - Find executable files:
                    fd --type executable
                    fd -tx
                - Find empty files:
                    fd --type empty --type file
                    fd -te -tf
                - Find empty directories:
                    fd --type empty --type directory
                    fd -te -td

       -e, --extension ext
              Filter search results by file extension ext.  This option can be used repeatedly to allow for multiple possible file extensions.

              If you want to search for files without extension, you can use the regex '^[^.]+$' as a normal search pattern.

       -E, --exclude pattern
              Exclude files/directories that match the given glob pattern.  This overrides any other ignore logic.  Multiple exclude patterns can be specified.  Examples:
                --exclude '*.pyc'
                --exclude node_modules

       --ignore-file path
              Add a custom ignore-file in '.gitignore' format.  These files have a low precedence.

       -c, --color when
              Declare when to colorize search results:

              auto   Colorize output when standard output is connected to terminal (default).

              never  Do not colorize output.

              always Always colorize output.

       -j, --threads num
              Set number of threads to use for searching & executing (default: number of available CPU cores).

       -S, --size size
              Limit results based on the size of files using the format <+-><NUM><UNIT>

              '+'    file size must be greater than or equal to this

              '-'    file size must be less than or equal to this

              If neither '+' nor '-' is specified, file size must be exactly equal to this.

              'NUM'  The numeric size (e.g. 500)

              'UNIT' The units for NUM. They are not case-sensitive.  Allowed unit values:

                     'b'    bytes

                     'k'    kilobytes (base ten, 10^3 = 1000 bytes)

                     'm'    megabytes

                     'g'    gigabytes

                     't'    terabytes

                     'ki'   kibibytes (base two, 2^10 = 1024 bytes)

                     'mi'   mebibytes

                     'gi'   gibibytes

                     'ti'   tebibytes

       --changed-within date|duration
              Filter results based on the file modification time.  Files with modification times greater than the argument will be returned.  The argument can be provided as a duration (10h, 1d,  35min)
              or  as  a  specific  point  in time in either full RFC3339 format with time zone, or as a date or datetime in the local time zone (YYYY-MM-DD or YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS).  --change-newer-than,
              --newer or --changed-after can be used as aliases.

              Examples:
                --changed-within 2weeks
                --change-newer-than "2018-10-27 10:00:00"
                --newer 2018-10-27

       --changed-before date|duration
              Filter results based on the file modification time.  Files with modification times less than the argument will be returned.  The argument can be provided as a duration (10h, 1d, 35min)  or
              as  a  specific  point  in  time  in either full RFC3339 format with time zone, or as a date or datetime in the local time zone (YYYY-MM-DD or YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS).  --change-older-than or
              --older can be used as aliases.

              Examples:
                --changed-before "2018-10-27 10:00:00"
                --change-older-than 2weeks

       -o, --owner [user][:group]
              Filter files by their user and/or group. Format: [(user|uid)][:(group|gid)]. Either side is optional. Precede either side with a '!' to exclude files instead.

              Examples:
                --owner john
                --owner :students
                --owner "!john:students"

       --base-directory path
              Change the current working directory of fd to the provided path. This means that search results will be shown with respect to the given base path. Note that relative paths which are passed
              to fd via the positional path argument or the --search-path option will also be resolved relative to this directory.

       --path-separator separator
              Set the path separator to use when printing file paths. The default is the OS-specific separator ('/' on Unix, '\' on Windows).

       --search-path search-path
              Provide paths to search as an alternative to the positional path argument. Changes the usage to ´fd [FLAGS/OPTIONS] --search-path PATH --search-path PATH2 [PATTERN]´

       -x, --exec command
              Execute command for each search result in parallel (use --threads=1 for sequential command execution).

              Note that all subsequent positional arguments are considered to be arguments to the command - not to fd.  It is therefore recommended to place the -x/--exec option last. Alternatively, you
              can supply a ';' argument to end the argument list and continue with more fd options.  Most shells require ';' to be escaped: '\;'.  This option can be specified multiple times,  in  which
              case all commands are run for each file found, in the order they are provided. In that case, you must supply a ';' argument for all but the last commands.

              The following placeholders are substituted before the command is executed:

                     {}     path (of the current search result)

                     {/}    basename

                     {//}   parent directory

                     {.}    path without file extension

                     {/.}   basename without file extension

              If no placeholder is present, an implicit "{}" at the end is assumed.

              Examples:

                - find all *.zip files and unzip them:

                      fd -e zip -x unzip

                - find *.h and *.cpp files and run "clang-format -i .." for each of them:

                      fd -e h -e cpp -x clang-format -i

                - Convert all *.jpg files to *.png files:

                      fd -e jpg -x convert {} {.}.png

       -X, --exec-batch command
              Execute command once, with all search results as arguments.  One of the following placeholders is substituted before the command is executed:

                     {}     path (of all search results)

                     {/}    basename

                     {//}   parent directory

                     {.}    path without file extension

                     {/.}   basename without file extension

              If no placeholder is present, an implicit "{}" at the end is assumed.

              Like --exec, this can be used multiple times, in which case each command will be run in the order given.

              Examples:

                - Find all test_*.py files and open them in your favorite editor:

                      fd -g 'test_*.py' -X vim

                  Note that this executes a single "vim" process with all search results as arguments.

                - Find all *.rs files and count the lines with "wc -l ...":

                      fd -e rs -X wc -l

       --batch-size size
              Maximum  number of arguments to pass to the command given with -X. If the number of results is greater than the given size, the command given with -X is run again with remaining arguments.
              A batch size of zero means there is no limit (default), but note that batching might still happen due to OS restrictions on the maximum length of command lines.

PATTERN SYNTAX
       The regular expression syntax used by fd is documented here:

           https://docs.rs/regex/1.0.0/regex/#syntax

       The glob syntax is documented here:

           https://docs.rs/globset/#syntax

ENVIRONMENT
       LS_COLORS
              Determines how to colorize search results, see dircolors(1).

       NO_COLOR
              Disables colorized output.

       XDG_CONFIG_HOME, HOME
              Used to locate the global ignore file. If XDG_CONFIG_HOME is set, use $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/fd/ignore.  Otherwise, use $HOME/.config/fd/ignore.

EXAMPLES
       Find files and directories that match the pattern 'needle':
              $ fd needle

       Start a search in a given directory (/var/log):
              $ fd nginx /var/log

       Find all Python files (all files with the extension .py) in the current directory:
              $ fd -e py

       Open all search results with vim:
              $ fd pattern -X vim

NAME
       fd - floppy disk device

CONFIGURATION
       Floppy  drives  are block devices with major number 2.  Typically they are owned by root:floppy (i.e., user root, group floppy) and have either mode 0660 (access checking via group membership) or
       mode 0666 (everybody has access).  The minor numbers encode the device type, drive number, and controller number.  For each device type (that is, combination of density and track count) there  is
       a  base  minor  number.  To this base number, add the drive's number on its controller and 128 if the drive is on the secondary controller.  In the following device tables, n represents the drive
       number.

       Warning: if you use formats with more tracks than supported by your drive, you may cause it mechanical damage.  Trying once if more tracks than the usual 40/80 are supported should not damage it,
       but no warranty is given for that.  If you are not sure, don't create device entries for those formats, so as to prevent their usage.

DESCRIPTION
       fd special files access the floppy disk drives in raw mode.  The following ioctl(2) calls are supported by fd devices:

       FDCLRPRM
              clears the media information of a drive (geometry of disk in drive).

       FDSETPRM
              sets the media information of a drive.  The media information will be lost when the media is changed.

       FDDEFPRM
              sets  the  media information of a drive (geometry of disk in drive).  The media information will not be lost when the media is changed.  This will disable autodetection.  In order to reen‐
              able autodetection, you have to issue an FDCLRPRM.

       FDGETDRVTYP
              returns the type of a drive (name parameter).  For formats which work in several drive types, FDGETDRVTYP returns a name which is appropriate for the oldest drive type which supports  this
              format.

       FDFLUSH
              invalidates the buffer cache for the given drive.

       FDSETMAXERRS
              sets the error thresholds for reporting errors, aborting the operation, recalibrating, resetting, and reading sector by sector.

       FDSETMAXERRS
              gets the current error thresholds.

       FDGETDRVTYP
              gets the internal name of the drive.

       FDWERRORCLR
              clears the write error statistics.

       FDWERRORGET
              reads the write error statistics.  These include the total number of write errors, the location and disk of the first write error, and the location and disk of the last write error.  Disks
              are identified by a generation number which is incremented at (almost) each disk change.

       FDTWADDLE
              Switch the drive motor off for a few microseconds.  This might be needed in order to access a disk whose sectors are too close together.

       FDSETDRVPRM
              sets various drive parameters.

       FDGETDRVPRM
              reads these parameters back.

       FDGETDRVSTAT
              gets the cached drive state (disk changed, write protected et al.)

       FDPOLLDRVSTAT
              polls the drive and return its state.

       FDGETFDCSTAT
              gets the floppy controller state.

       FDRESET
              resets the floppy controller under certain conditions.

       FDRAWCMD
              sends a raw command to the floppy controller.

       For more precise information, consult also the <linux/fd.h> and <linux/fdreg.h> include files, as well as the floppycontrol(1) manual page.

NOTES
       The various formats permit reading and writing many types of disks.  However, if a floppy is formatted with an inter-sector gap that is too small, performance may drop, to the point of needing  a
       few seconds to access an entire track.  To prevent this, use interleaved formats.

       It is not possible to read floppies which are formatted using GCR (group code recording), which is used by Apple II and Macintosh computers (800k disks).

       Reading floppies which are hard sectored (one hole per sector, with the index hole being a little skewed) is not supported.  This used to be common with older 8-inch floppies.
