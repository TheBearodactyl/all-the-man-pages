NAME
       idevicesyslog - Relay syslog of a connected device.

SYNOPSIS
       idevicesyslog [OPTIONS]

DESCRIPTION
       Relay syslog of a connected device.

OPTIONS
       -u, --udid UDID
              target specific device by UDID

       -n, --network
              connect to network device

       -x, --exit
              exit when device disconnects

       -d, --debug
              enable communication debugging

       -h, --help
              prints usage information

       -v, --version
              prints version information.

       --no-colors
              disable colored output

FILTER OPTIONS
       -m, --match STRING
              only print messages that contain STRING

              This option will set a filter to only printed log messages that contain the given string.

       -t, --trigger STRING
              start logging when matching STRING

              When specified, logging will start as soon as a log messages is encountered that contains the given string. See also -T, --untrigger. Other filters are still applied but obviously filtered
              messages are only printed after logging has started.

       -T, --untrigger STRING
              stop logging when matching STRING

              When specified logging will halt as soon as a log message is encountered that contains the given string. See also -t, --trigger. Other filters are still applied but obviously filtered mes‐
              sages are only printed before logging stops.

              NOTE: If no --trigger is given, idevicesyslog will exit after a matching log message was encountered.

       -p, --process PROCESS
              only print messages from matching process(es)

              PROCESS is a string that can either be a numeric pid or a process name. It also supports multiple process names or pids in one string, separated by | (make sure to use quotes!).

       -e, --exclude PROCESS
              print all messages except matching process(es)

              PROCESS is a string that can either be a numeric pid or a process name. It also supports multiple process names or pids in one string, separated by | (make sure to use quotes!).

       -q, --quiet
              set a filter to exclude common noisy processes

              Since  the  syslog can be quite noisy, this quick command line switch allows to silence out a predefined set of commonly known processes. The list of processes that are silenced can be re‐
              trieved with --quiet-list.

       --quiet-list
              prints the list of processes for --quiet and exits

       -k, --kernel
              only print kernel messages

              This is actually equivalent to passing --process kernel with the exception that it can be used with --quiet to silence out the noisy process but still get all the kernel log messages.

       -K, --no-kernel
              suppress kernel messages

              This is equivalent to passing --exclude kernel.

EXAMPLES
       idevicesyslog -u 00008030-0000111ABC000DEF
              Relay syslog of device with UDID 00008030-0000111ABC000DEF.

       idevicesyslog -x
              Relay syslog of device and exit when the device is unplugged.

       idevicesyslog -m '####' -e 'identityservicesd' -K
              Only print log messages that contain the string #### and do NOT originate from identityservicesd or the kernel.

       idevicesyslog -p MyApp -p ReportCrash
              Only print log messages from the process named 'MyApp' and 'ReportCrash'.

       idevicesyslog -p 'MyApp|ReportCrash'
              Same as previous example with different syntax.

       idevicesyslog -e 'backboardd|CommCenter|mDNSResponder'
              Suppress log messages from backboardd, CommCenter, and mDNSResponder.

       idevicesyslog -q -k
              Suppress log messages from common noisy processes, but DO print kernel log messages.

       idevicesyslog -K
              Suppress log messages from kernel, but print everything else

       idevicesyslog -t 'backlight on' -T 'backlight off' -q
              Start logging when the device turns on backlight and stop logging when it turns backlight off, and suppress noisy processes
