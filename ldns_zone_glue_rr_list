NAME
       ldns_zone_sort, ldns_zone_glue_rr_list - sort a zone and get the glue records

SYNOPSIS
       #include <stdint.h>
       #include <stdbool.h>

       #include <ldns/ldns.h>

       void ldns_zone_sort(ldns_zone *zone);

       ldns_rr_list* ldns_zone_glue_rr_list(const ldns_zone *z);

DESCRIPTION
       ldns_zone_sort() Sort the rrs in a zone, with the current impl. this is slow
              zone: the zone to sort

       ldns_zone_glue_rr_list() Retrieve all resource records from the zone that are glue records. The resulting list does are pointer references to the zone's data.

              Due to the current zone implementation (as a list of rr's), this function is extremely slow. Another (probably better) way to do this is to use an ldns_dnssec_zone structure and the
              ldns_dnssec_mark_and_get_glue() function.

              z: the zone to look for glue
              Returns the rr_list with the glue
