NAME
       asn1_decode_simple_ber - API function

SYNOPSIS
       #include <libtasn1.h>

       int asn1_decode_simple_ber(unsigned int etype, const unsigned char * der, unsigned int _der_len, unsigned char ** str, unsigned int * str_len, unsigned int * ber_len);

ARGUMENTS
       unsigned int etype
                   The type of the string to be encoded (ASN1_ETYPE_)

       const unsigned char * der
                   the encoded string

       unsigned int _der_len
                   the bytes of the encoded string

       unsigned char ** str
                   a pointer to the data

       unsigned int * str_len
                   the length of the data

       unsigned int * ber_len
                   the total length occupied by BER (may be NULL)

DESCRIPTION
       Decodes a BER encoded type. The output is an allocated value of the data. This decodes BER STRINGS only. Other types are decoded as DER.

RETURNS
       ASN1_SUCCESS if successful or an error value.
