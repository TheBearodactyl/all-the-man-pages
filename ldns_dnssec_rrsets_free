NAME

SYNOPSIS
       #include <stdint.h>
       #include <stdbool.h>

       #include <ldns/ldns.h>

       ldns_dnssec_rrsets* ldns_dnssec_rrsets_new(void);

       void ldns_dnssec_rrsets_free(ldns_dnssec_rrsets *rrsets);

       ldns_rr_type ldns_dnssec_rrsets_type(const ldns_dnssec_rrsets *rrsets);

       ldns_status ldns_dnssec_rrsets_set_type(ldns_dnssec_rrsets *rrsets, ldns_rr_type type);

       ldns_status ldns_dnssec_rrsets_add_rr(ldns_dnssec_rrsets *rrsets, ldns_rr *rr);

       void ldns_dnssec_rrsets_print(FILE *out, const ldns_dnssec_rrsets *rrsets, bool follow);

DESCRIPTION
       ldns_dnssec_rrsets_new() Creates a new list (entry) of RRsets
              Returns the newly allocated structure

       ldns_dnssec_rrsets_free() Frees the list of rrsets and their rrs, but *not* the ldns_rr records in the sets

              rrsets: the data structure to free

       ldns_dnssec_rrsets_type() Returns the rr type of the rrset (that is head of the given list)

              rrsets: the rrset to get the type of
              Returns the rr type

       ldns_dnssec_rrsets_set_type() Sets the RR type of the rrset (that is head of the given list)

              rrsets: the rrset to set the type of
              type: the type to set
              Returns LDNS_STATUS_OK on success

       ldns_dnssec_rrsets_add_rr() Add an ldns_rr to the corresponding RRset in the given list of RRsets.  If it is not present, add it as a new RRset with 1 record.

              rrsets: the list of rrsets to add the RR to
              rr: the rr to add to the list of rrsets
              Returns LDNS_STATUS_OK on success

       ldns_dnssec_rrsets_print() Print the given list of rrsets to the given file descriptor

              out: the file descriptor to print to
              rrsets: the list of RRsets to print
              follow: if set to false, only print the first RRset
