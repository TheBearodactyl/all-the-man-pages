NAME
       tcti-swtpm - TPM simulator TCTI library

SYNOPSIS
       A TPM Command Transmission Interface (TCTI) module for interaction with the TPM2 software simulator.

DESCRIPTION
       tcti-swtpm  is  a library that abstracts the details of direct communication with the interface and protocol exposed by the daemon hosting the TPM2 reference implementation. The interface exposed
       by this library is defined in the “TSS System Level API and TPM Command Transmission Interface Specification” specification.

NOTES
       It is best not to use the CUSE interface when setting up swtpm, but rather to use the vtpm module proxy:
       modprobe tpm_vtpm_proxy
       swtpm chardev --vtpm-proxy --tpmstate dir=... --tpm2 ...
