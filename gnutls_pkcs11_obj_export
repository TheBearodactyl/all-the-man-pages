NAME
       gnutls_pkcs11_obj_export - API function

SYNOPSIS
       #include <gnutls/pkcs11.h>

       int gnutls_pkcs11_obj_export(gnutls_pkcs11_obj_t obj, void * output_data, size_t * output_data_size);

ARGUMENTS
       gnutls_pkcs11_obj_t obj
                   Holds the object

       void * output_data
                   will contain the object data

       size_t * output_data_size
                   holds the size of output_data (and will be replaced by the actual size of parameters)

DESCRIPTION
       This function will export the PKCS11 object data.  It is normal for data to be inaccessible and in that case GNUTLS_E_INVALID_REQUEST will be returned.

       If the buffer provided is not long enough to hold the output, then *output_data_size is updated and GNUTLS_E_SHORT_MEMORY_BUFFER will be returned.

RETURNS
       In case of failure a negative error code will be returned, and GNUTLS_E_SUCCESS (0) on success.

SINCE
       2.12.0
