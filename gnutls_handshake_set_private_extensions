NAME
       gnutls_handshake_set_private_extensions - API function

SYNOPSIS
       #include <gnutls/gnutls.h>

       void gnutls_handshake_set_private_extensions(gnutls_session_t session, int allow);

ARGUMENTS
       gnutls_session_t session
                   is a gnutls_session_t type.

       int allow   is an integer (0 or 1)

DESCRIPTION
       This function will enable or disable the use of private cipher suites (the ones that start with 0xFF).  By default or if  allow is 0 then these cipher suites will not be advertised nor used.

       Currently GnuTLS does not include such cipher-suites or compression algorithms.

       Enabling the private ciphersuites when talking to other than gnutls servers and clients may cause interoperability problems.
