NAME
       wcsncmp - compare two fixed-size wide-character strings

LIBRARY
       Standard C library (libc, -lc)

SYNOPSIS
       #include <wchar.h>

       int wcsncmp(const wchar_t s1[.n], const wchar_t s2[.n], size_t n);

DESCRIPTION
       The  wcsncmp() function is the wide-character equivalent of the strncmp(3) function.  It compares the wide-character string pointed to by s1 and the wide-character string pointed to by s2, but at
       most n wide characters from each string.  In each string, the comparison extends only up to the first occurrence of a null wide character (L'\0'), if any.

RETURN VALUE
       The wcsncmp() function returns zero if the wide-character strings at s1 and s2, truncated to at most length n, are equal.  It returns an integer greater than zero if at the first differing  posi‐
       tion  i (i < n), the corresponding wide-character s1[i] is greater than s2[i].  It returns an integer less than zero if at the first differing position i (i < n), the corresponding wide-character
       s1[i] is less than s2[i].

PROLOG

       the interface may not be implemented on Linux.

NAME
       wcsncmp — compare part of two wide-character strings

SYNOPSIS
       #include <wchar.h>

       int wcsncmp(const wchar_t *ws1, const wchar_t *ws2, size_t n);

DESCRIPTION
       The functionality described on this reference page is aligned with the ISO C standard. Any conflict between the requirements described here and the ISO C standard is unintentional. This volume of
       POSIX.1‐2017 defers to the ISO C standard.

       The  wcsncmp()  function  shall compare not more than n wide-character codes (wide-character codes that follow a null wide-character code are not compared) from the array pointed to by ws1 to the
       array pointed to by ws2.

       The sign of a non-zero return value shall be determined by the sign of the difference between the values of the first pair of wide-character codes that differ in the objects being compared.

RETURN VALUE
       Upon successful completion, wcsncmp() shall return an integer greater than, equal to, or less than 0, if the possibly null-terminated array pointed to by ws1 is greater than, equal  to,  or  less
       than the possibly null-terminated array pointed to by ws2, respectively.

ERRORS
       No errors are defined.
