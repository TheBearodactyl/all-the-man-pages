NAME
       gnutls_db_remove_session - API function

SYNOPSIS
       #include <gnutls/gnutls.h>

       void gnutls_db_remove_session(gnutls_session_t session);

ARGUMENTS
       gnutls_session_t session
                   is a gnutls_session_t type.

DESCRIPTION
       This  function  will  remove  the current session data from the session database.  This will prevent future handshakes reusing these session data.  This function should be called if a session was
       terminated abnormally, and before gnutls_deinit() is called.

       Normally gnutls_deinit() will remove abnormally terminated sessions.
