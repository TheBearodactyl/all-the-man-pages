NAME
       key.dns_resolver - upcall for request-key to handle dns_resolver keys

SYNOPSIS
       /sbin/key.dns_resolver <key>
       /sbin/key.dns_resolver --dump-config [-c <configfile>]
       /sbin/key.dns_resolver -D [-v] [-v] [-c <configfile>] <desc>
       <calloutinfo>

DESCRIPTION
       This  program is invoked by request-key on behalf of the kernel when kernel services (such as NFS, CIFS and AFS) want to perform a hostname lookup and the kernel does not have the key cached.  It
       is not ordinarily intended to be called directly.

       There program has internal parameters that can be changed with a configuration file (see key.dns_resolver.conf(5) for more information).  The default configuration file is in /etc, but  this  can
       be overridden with the -c flag.

       The  program can be called in debugging mode to test its functionality by passing a -D or --debug flag on the command line.  For this to work, the key description and the callout information must
       be supplied.  Verbosity can be increased by supplying one or more -v flags.

       The program may also be called with --dump-config to show the values that configurable parameters will have after parsing the config file.

ERRORS
       All errors will be logged to the syslog.
