NAME
       io_uring_prep_poll_remove - prepare a poll deletion request

SYNOPSIS
       #include <liburing.h>

       void io_uring_prep_poll_remove(struct io_uring_sqe *sqe,
                                      __u64 user_data);

DESCRIPTION
       The io_uring_prep_poll_remove(3) function prepares a poll removal request. The submission queue entry sqe is setup to remove a poll request identified by user_data

       Works like io_uring_prep_cancel(3) except only looks for poll requests. Apart from that, behavior is identical.  See that man page for specific details.

RETURN VALUE
       None

ERRORS
       These are the errors that are reported in the CQE res field. On success, 0 is returned.

       -ENOENT
              The request identified by user_data could not be located. This could be because it completed before the cancelation request was issued, or if an invalid identifier is used.

       -EINVAL
              One of the fields set in the SQE was invalid.

       -EALREADY
              The execution state of the request has progressed far enough that cancelation is no longer possible. This should normally mean that it will complete shortly, either successfully, or inter‚Äê
              rupted due to the cancelation.
