SSL_IN_INIT(3ssl)                   OpenSSL                  SSL_IN_INIT(3ssl)

NAME
       SSL_in_before, SSL_in_init, SSL_is_init_finished, SSL_in_connect_init,
       SSL_in_accept_init, SSL_get_state - retrieve information about the
       handshake state machine

SYNOPSIS
        #include <openssl/ssl.h>

        int SSL_in_init(const SSL *s);
        int SSL_in_before(const SSL *s);
        int SSL_is_init_finished(const SSL *s);

        int SSL_in_connect_init(SSL *s);
        int SSL_in_accept_init(SSL *s);

        OSSL_HANDSHAKE_STATE SSL_get_state(const SSL *ssl);

DESCRIPTION
       SSL_in_init() returns 1 if the SSL/TLS state machine is currently
       processing or awaiting handshake messages, or 0 otherwise.

       SSL_in_before() returns 1 if no SSL/TLS handshake has yet been
       initiated, or 0 otherwise.

       SSL_is_init_finished() returns 1 if the SSL/TLS connection is in a
       state where fully protected application data can be transferred or 0
       otherwise.

       Note that in some circumstances (such as when early data is being
       transferred) SSL_in_init(), SSL_in_before() and SSL_is_init_finished()
       can all return 0.

       SSL_in_connect_init() returns 1 if s is acting as a client and
       SSL_in_init() would return 1, or 0 otherwise.

       SSL_in_accept_init() returns 1 if s is acting as a server and
       SSL_in_init() would return 1, or 0 otherwise.

       SSL_in_connect_init() and SSL_in_accept_init() are implemented as
       macros.

       SSL_get_state() returns a value indicating the current state of the
       handshake state machine. OSSL_HANDSHAKE_STATE is an enumerated type
       where each value indicates a discrete state machine state. Note that
       future versions of OpenSSL may define more states so applications
       should expect to receive unrecognised state values. The naming format
       is made up of a number of elements as follows:

       protocol_ST_role_message

       protocol is one of TLS or DTLS. DTLS is used where a state is specific
       to the DTLS protocol. Otherwise TLS is used.

       role is one of CR, CW, SR or SW to indicate "client reading", "client
       writing", "server reading" or "server writing" respectively.

       message is the name of a handshake message that is being or has been
       sent, or is being or has been processed.

       Additionally there are some special states that do not conform to the
       above format. These are:

       TLS_ST_BEFORE
           No handshake messages have yet been been sent or received.

       TLS_ST_OK
           Handshake message sending/processing has completed.

       TLS_ST_EARLY_DATA
           Early data is being processed

       TLS_ST_PENDING_EARLY_DATA_END
           Awaiting the end of early data processing

RETURN VALUES
       SSL_in_init(), SSL_in_before(), SSL_is_init_finished(),
       SSL_in_connect_init() and SSL_in_accept_init() return values as
       indicated above.

       SSL_get_state() returns the current handshake state.
