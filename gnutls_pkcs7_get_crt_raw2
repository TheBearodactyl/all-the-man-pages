       #include <gnutls/pkcs7.h>

       int gnutls_pkcs7_get_crt_raw2(gnutls_pkcs7_t pkcs7, unsigned indx, gnutls_datum_t * cert);

ARGUMENTS
       gnutls_pkcs7_t pkcs7
                   should contain a gnutls_pkcs7_t type

       unsigned indx
                   contains the index of the certificate to extract

       gnutls_datum_t * cert
                   will hold the contents of the certificate; must be deallocated with gnutls_free()
