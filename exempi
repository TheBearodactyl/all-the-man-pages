       exempi - command line tool to manipulate XMP metadata

SYNTAX
       exempi { -h | [ -R ] [ -X ] [ -x [ -p ] ] [ { -w | -o <file> } ] [ { -g <prop_name> | -s <prop_name> -v <value> }  ] } <files>

OPTIONS
       -h: show this help

       -R: don't reconcile

       -x: dump XML

       -p: wrap XML packet wrapper. Only for -x.

       -w: write in place. Only for -s. Not compatible with -o.

       -o <file>: file to write the output to.

       <files> the files to read from.

SECURITY
       The source code hasn't been audited for security. The command line tool doesn't have a strong input sanity checking easier.

       Be careful not to run the tool as super-user. Be careful if you decide to use it in an online (web) application.

       Patches and suggestions welcome.
