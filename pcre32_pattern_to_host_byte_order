NAME
       PCRE - Perl-compatible regular expressions

SYNOPSIS

       #include <pcre.h>

       int pcre_pattern_to_host_byte_order(pcre *code,
            pcre_extra *extra, const unsigned char *tables);

       int pcre16_pattern_to_host_byte_order(pcre16 *code,
            pcre16_extra *extra, const unsigned char *tables);

       int pcre32_pattern_to_host_byte_order(pcre32 *code,
            pcre32_extra *extra, const unsigned char *tables);

DESCRIPTION

       This  function  ensures that the bytes in 2-byte and 4-byte values in a
       compiled pattern are in the correct order for the current host.  It  is
       useful when a pattern that has been compiled on one host is transferred
       to another that might have different endianness. The arguments are:

         code         A compiled regular expression
         extra        Points to an associated pcre[16|32]_extra structure,
                        or is NULL
         tables       Pointer to character tables, or NULL to
                        set the built-in default

       The result is 0 for success, a negative PCRE_ERROR_xxx value otherwise.

       There is a complete description of the PCRE native API in  the  pcreapi
       page and a description of the POSIX API in the pcreposix page.
