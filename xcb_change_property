NAME
       xcb_change_property - Changes a window property

SYNOPSIS
       #include <xcb/xproto.h>

   Request function
       xcb_void_cookie_t xcb_change_property(xcb_connection_t *conn, uint8_t mode, xcb_window_t window, xcb_atom_t property, xcb_atom_t type, uint8_t format, uint32_t data_len, const void *data);

REQUEST ARGUMENTS
       conn      The XCB connection to X11.

       mode      One of the following values:

                 XCB_PROP_MODE_REPLACE
                           Discard the previous property value and store the new data.

                 XCB_PROP_MODE_PREPEND
                           Insert the new data before the beginning of existing data. The format must match existing property value. If the property is undefined, it is treated as defined with the cor‐
                           rect type and format with zero-length data.

                 XCB_PROP_MODE_APPEND
                           Insert the new data after the beginning of existing data. The format must match existing property value. If the property is undefined, it is treated as defined with the cor‐
                           rect type and format with zero-length data.

       window    The window whose property you want to change.

       property  The property you want to change (an atom).

       type      The type of the property you want to change (an atom).

       format    Specifies whether the data should be viewed as a list of 8-bit, 16-bit or 32-bit quantities. Possible values are 8, 16 and 32. This information allows the X server to correctly perform
                 byte-swap operations as necessary.

       data_len  Specifies the number of elements (see format).

       data      The property data.

DESCRIPTION
       Sets or updates a property on the specified window. Properties are for example the window title (WM_NAME) or its minimum size (WM_NORMAL_HINTS).  Protocols such as EWMH also use properties - for
       example EWMH defines the window title, encoded as UTF-8 string, in the _NET_WM_NAME property.

RETURN VALUE
       Returns an xcb_void_cookie_t. Errors (if any) have to be handled in the event loop.

       If you want to handle errors directly with xcb_request_check instead, use xcb_change_property_checked. See xcb-requests(3) for details.

ERRORS
       xcb_alloc_error_t
                 The X server could not store the property (no memory?).

       xcb_atom_error_t
                 property or type do not refer to a valid atom.

       xcb_match_error_t
                 TODO: reasons?

       xcb_value_error_t
                 TODO: reasons?

       xcb_window_error_t
                 The specified window does not exist.

EXAMPLE
       /*
        * Sets the WM_NAME property of the window to "XCB Example".
        *
        */
       void my_example(xcb_connection_t *conn, xcb_window_t window) {
           xcb_change_property(conn,
               XCB_PROP_MODE_REPLACE,
               window,
               XCB_ATOM_WM_NAME,
               XCB_ATOM_STRING,
               8,
               strlen("XCB Example"),
               "XCB Example");
           xcb_flush(conn);
       }
