OMPI_CRCP(7)                       Open MPI                       OMPI_CRCP(7)

NAME
       OMPI_CRCP  -  Open  MPI  MCA  Checkpoint/Restart  Coordination Protocol
       (CRCP) Framework: Overview of Open MPI's CRCP framework,  and  selected
       modules.  Open MPI 4.1.5

DESCRIPTION
       The CRCP Framework is used by Open MPI for the encapsulation of various
       Checkpoint/Restart Coordination Protocols (e.g., Coordinated, Uncoordi‐
       nated, Message/Communication Induced, ...).

GENERAL PROCESS REQUIREMENTS
       In  order for a process to use the Open MPI CRCP components it must ad‐
       hear to a few programmatic requirements.

       First, the program must call MPI_INIT early in its execution.

       The program must call MPI_FINALIZE before termination.

       A user may initiate a checkpoint of a parallel application by using the
       ompi-checkpoint(1) and ompi-restart(1) commands.

AVAILABLE COMPONENTS
       Open MPI currently ships with one CRCP component: coord.

       The following MCA parameters apply to all components:

       crcp_base_verbose
           Set the verbosity level for all components. Default is 0, or silent
           except on error.

   coord CRCP Component
       The coord component implements a Coordinated Checkpoint/Restart Coordi‐
       nation Protocol similar to the one implemented in LAM/MPI.

       The coord component has the following MCA parameters:

       crcp_coord_priority
           The component's priority to use when selecting the most appropriate
           component for a run.

       crcp_coord_verbose
           Set the verbosity level for this component. Default is 0, or silent
           except on error.

   none CRCP Component
       The  none  component  simply selects no CRCP component. All of the CRCP
       function calls return immediately with OMPI_SUCCESS.

       This component is the last component to be selected  by  default.  This
       means  that  if  another component is available, and the none component
       was not explicity requested then Open MPI will attempt to activate  all
       of the available components before falling back to this component.
