NAME
       crontab - maintains crontab files for individual users

SYNOPSIS
       crontab [-u user] <file | ->
       crontab [-T] <file | ->
       crontab [-u user] <-l | -r | -e> [-i] [-s]
       crontab -n [ hostname ]
       crontab -c
       crontab -V

DESCRIPTION
       Crontab is the program used to install a crontab table file, remove or list the existing tables used to serve the cron(8) daemon.  Each user can have their own crontab, and though these are files
       in /var/spool/, they are not intended to be edited directly.  For SELinux in MLS mode, you can define more crontabs for each range.  For more information, see selinux(8).

       In this version of Cron it is possible to use a network-mounted shared /var/spool/cron across a cluster of hosts and specify that only one of the hosts should run the crontab jobs in the particu‐
       lar directory at any one time.  You may also use crontab from any of these hosts to edit the same shared set of crontab files, and to set and query which host should run the crontab jobs.

       Scheduling  cron  jobs  with  crontab  can  be allowed or disallowed for different users.  For this purpose, use the cron.allow and cron.deny files.  If the cron.allow file exists, a user must be
       listed in it to be allowed to use crontab.  If the cron.allow file does not exist but the cron.deny file does exist, then a user must not be listed in the cron.deny file in order to use  crontab.
       If neither of these files exist, then only the super user is allowed to use crontab.

       Another  way  to  restrict  the scheduling of cron jobs beyond crontab is to use PAM authentication in /etc/security/access.conf to set up users, which are allowed or disallowed to use crontab or
       modify system cron jobs in the /etc/cron.d/ directory.

       The temporary directory can be set in an environment variable.  If it is not set by the user, the /tmp directory is used.

       When listing a crontab on a terminal the output will be colorized unless an environment variable NO_COLOR is set.

OPTIONS
       -u     Specifies the name of the user whose crontab is to be modified.  If this option is not used, crontab examines "your" crontab, i.e., the crontab of the person executing the command.  If  no
              crontab exists for a particular user, it is created for them the first time the crontab -u command is used under their username.

       -T     Test the crontab file syntax without installing it.  Once an issue is found, the validation is interrupted, so this will not return all the existing issues at the same execution.

       -l     Displays the current crontab on standard output.

       -r     Removes the current crontab.

       -e     Edits the current crontab using the editor specified by the VISUAL or EDITOR environment variables.  After you exit from the editor, the modified crontab will be installed automatically.

       -i     This option modifies the -r option to prompt the user for a 'y/Y' response before actually removing the crontab.

       -s     Appends the current SELinux security context string as an MLS_LEVEL setting to the crontab file before editing / replacement occurs - see the documentation of MLS_LEVEL in crontab(5).

       -n     This  option is relevant only if cron(8) was started with the -c option, to enable clustering support.  It is used to set the host in the cluster which should run the jobs specified in the
              crontab files in the /var/spool/cron directory.  If a hostname is supplied, the host whose hostname returned by gethostname(2) matches the supplied hostname, will be selected  to  run  the
              selected  cron jobs subsequently.  If there is no host in the cluster matching the supplied hostname, or you explicitly specify an empty hostname, then the selected jobs will not be run at
              all.  If the hostname is omitted, the name of the local host returned by gethostname(2) is used.  Using this option has no effect on the /etc/crontab file and the files in the  /etc/cron.d
              directory, which are always run, and considered host-specific.  For more information on clustering support, see cron(8).

       -c     This option is only relevant if cron(8) was started with the -c option, to enable clustering support.  It is used to query which host in the cluster is currently set to run the jobs speci‐
              fied in the crontab files in the directory /var/spool/cron , as set using the -n option.

       -V     Print version and exit.

CAVEATS
       The files cron.allow and cron.deny cannot be used to restrict the execution of cron jobs; they only restrict the use of crontab.  In particular, restricting access to crontab has no effect on  an
       existing crontab of a user. Its jobs will continue to be executed until the crontab is removed.

       The files cron.allow and cron.deny must be readable by the user invoking crontab.  If this is not the case, then they are treated as non-existent.

STANDARDS
       The  crontab  command conforms to IEEE Std1003.2-1992 (``POSIX'') with one exception: For replacing the current crontab with data from standard input the - has to be specified on the command line
       if the standard input is a TTY.  This new command syntax differs from previous versions of Vixie Cron, as well as from the classic SVR3 syntax.

DIAGNOSTICS
       An informative usage message appears if you run a crontab with a faulty command defined in it.

NAME
       crontab — schedule periodic background work

SYNOPSIS
       crontab [file]

       crontab [-e|-l|-r]

DESCRIPTION
       The crontab utility shall create, replace, or edit a user's crontab entry; a crontab entry is a list of commands and the times at which they shall be executed. The new crontab entry can be  input
       by specifying file or input from standard input if no file operand is specified, or by using an editor, if -e is specified.

       Upon execution of a command from a crontab entry, the implementation shall supply a default environment, defining at least the following environment variables:

       HOME      A pathname of the user's home directory.

       LOGNAME   The user's login name.

       PATH      A string representing a search path guaranteed to find all of the standard utilities.

       SHELL     A pathname of the command interpreter. When crontab is invoked as specified by this volume of POSIX.1‐2017, the value shall be a pathname for sh.

       The values of these variables when crontab is invoked as specified by this volume of POSIX.1‐2017 shall not affect the default values provided when the scheduled command is run.

       If  standard output and standard error are not redirected by commands executed from the crontab entry, any generated output or errors shall be mailed, via an implementation-defined method, to the
       user.

       Users shall be permitted to use crontab if their names appear in the file cron.allow which is located in an implementation-defined directory.  If that file does not  exist,  the  file  cron.deny,
       which is located in an implementation-defined directory, shall be checked to determine whether the user shall be denied access to crontab.  If neither file exists, only a process with appropriate
       privileges shall be allowed to submit a job. If only cron.deny exists and is empty, global usage shall be permitted. The cron.allow and cron.deny files shall consist of one user name per line.

OPTIONS
       The crontab utility shall conform to the Base Definitions volume of POSIX.1‐2017, Section 12.2, Utility Syntax Guidelines.

       The following options shall be supported:

       -e        Edit a copy of the invoking user's crontab entry, or create an empty entry to edit if the crontab entry does not exist. When editing is complete, the entry shall  be  installed  as  the
                 user's crontab entry.

       -l        (The letter ell.) List the invoking user's crontab entry.

       -r        Remove the invoking user's crontab entry.

OPERANDS
       The following operand shall be supported:

       file      The pathname of a file that contains specifications, in the format defined in the INPUT FILES section, for crontab entries.

STDIN
       See the INPUT FILES section.

INPUT FILES
       In  the  POSIX  locale,  the user or application shall ensure that a crontab entry is a text file consisting of lines of six fields each.  The fields shall be separated by <blank> characters. The
       first five fields shall be integer patterns that specify the following:

        1. Minute [0,59]

        2. Hour [0,23]

        3. Day of the month [1,31]

        4. Month of the year [1,12]

        5. Day of the week ([0,6] with 0=Sunday)

       Each of these patterns can be either an <asterisk> (meaning all valid values), an element, or a list of elements separated by <comma> characters. An element shall be either a number or  two  num‐
       bers  separated  by  a  <hyphen-minus> (meaning an inclusive range). The specification of days can be made by two fields (day of the month and day of the week). If month, day of month, and day of
       week are all <asterisk> characters, every day shall be matched. If either the month or day of month is specified as an element or list, but the day of week is an <asterisk>, the month and day  of
       month  fields  shall  specify  the  days that match. If both month and day of month are specified as an <asterisk>, but day of week is an element or list, then only the specified days of the week
       match. Finally, if either the month or day of month is specified as an element or list, and the day of week is also specified as an element or list, then any day matching either the month and day
       of month, or the day of week, shall be matched.

       The  sixth  field  of  a line in a crontab entry is a string that shall be executed by sh at the specified times. A <percent-sign> character in this field shall be translated to a <newline>.  Any
       character preceded by a <backslash> (including the '%') shall cause that character to be treated literally. Only the first line (up to a '%' or end-of-line) of the command field shall be executed
       by the command interpreter. The other lines shall be made available to the command as standard input.

       Blank lines and those whose first non-<blank> is '#' shall be ignored.

       The  text files cron.allow and cron.deny, which are located in an implementation-defined directory, shall contain zero or more user names, one per line, of users who are, respectively, authorized
       or denied access to the service underlying the crontab utility.

ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
       The following environment variables shall affect the execution of crontab:

       EDITOR    Determine the editor to be invoked when the -e option is specified. The default editor shall be vi.

       LANG      Provide a default value for the internationalization variables that are unset or null. (See the Base Definitions volume of POSIX.1‐2017, Section 8.2, Internationalization Variables  for
                 the precedence of internationalization variables used to determine the values of locale categories.)

       LC_ALL    If set to a non-empty string value, override the values of all the other internationalization variables.

       LC_CTYPE  Determine the locale for the interpretation of sequences of bytes of text data as characters (for example, single-byte as opposed to multi-byte characters in arguments and input files).

       LC_MESSAGES
                 Determine the locale that should be used to affect the format and contents of diagnostic messages written to standard error.

       NLSPATH   Determine the location of message catalogs for the processing of LC_MESSAGES.

ASYNCHRONOUS EVENTS
       Default.

STDOUT
       If the -l option is specified, the crontab entry shall be written to the standard output.

STDERR
       The standard error shall be used only for diagnostic messages.

OUTPUT FILES
       None.

EXTENDED DESCRIPTION
       None.

EXIT STATUS
       The following exit values shall be returned:

        0    Successful completion.

       >0    An error occurred.

CONSEQUENCES OF ERRORS
       The user's crontab entry is not submitted, removed, edited, or listed.

       The following sections are informative.

APPLICATION USAGE
       The  format  of the crontab entry shown here is guaranteed only for the POSIX locale. Other cultures may be supported with substantially different interfaces, although implementations are encour‐
       aged to provide comparable levels of functionality.

       The default settings of the HOME, LOGNAME, PATH, and SHELL variables that are given to the scheduled job are not affected by the settings of those variables when crontab is run; as  stated,  they
       are defaults. The text about ``invoked as specified by this volume of POSIX.1‐2017'' means that the implementation may provide extensions that allow these variables to be affected at runtime, but
       that the user has to take explicit action in order to access the extension, such as give a new option flag or modify the format of the crontab entry.

       A typical user error is to type only crontab; this causes the system to wait for the new crontab entry on standard input. If end-of-file is typed (generally <control>‐D), the crontab entry is re‐
       placed by an empty file. In this case, the user should type the interrupt character, which prevents the crontab entry from being replaced.

EXAMPLES
        1. Clean up core files every weekday morning at 3:15 am:

               15 3 * * 1-5 find "$HOME" -name core -exec rm -f {} + 2>/dev/null

        2. Mail a birthday greeting:

               0 12 14 2 * mailx john%Happy Birthday!%Time for lunch.

        3. As an example of specifying the two types of days:

               0 0 1,15 * 1

           would run a command on the first and fifteenth of each month, as well as on every Monday. To specify days by only one field, the other field should be set to '*'; for example:

               0 0 * * 1

           would run a command only on Mondays.

RATIONALE
       All references to a cron daemon and to cron files have been omitted. Although historical implementations have used this arrangement, there is no reason to limit future implementations.

       This  description of crontab is designed to support only users with normal privileges. The format of the input is based on the System V crontab; however, there is no requirement here that the ac‐
       tual system database used by the cron daemon (or a similar mechanism) use this format internally. For example, systems derived from BSD are likely to have an additional field appended that  indi‐
       cates the user identity to be used when the job is submitted.

       The -e option was adopted from the SVID as a user convenience, although it does not exist in all historical implementations.

FUTURE DIRECTIONS
       None.

NAME
       crontab - files used to schedule the execution of programs

DESCRIPTION
       A  crontab  file  contains instructions for the cron(8) daemon in the following simplified manner: "run this command at this time on this date".  Each user can define their own crontab.  Commands
       defined in any given crontab are executed under the user who owns that particular crontab.  Uucp and News usually have their own crontabs, eliminating the need for  explicitly  running  su(1)  as
       part of a cron command.

       Blank lines, leading spaces, and tabs are ignored.  Lines whose first non-white space character is a pound-sign (#) are comments, and are not processed.  Note that comments are not allowed on the
       same line as cron commands, since they are considered a part of the command.  Similarly, comments are not allowed on the same line as environment variable settings.

       An active line in a crontab is either an environment setting or a cron command.  An environment setting is of the form:

          name = value

       where the white spaces around the equal-sign (=) are optional, and any subsequent non-leading white spaces in value is a part of the value assigned to name.  The value string  may  be  placed  in
       quotes (single or double, but matching) to preserve leading or trailing white spaces.

       Several  environment  variables  are set up automatically by the cron(8) daemon.  SHELL is set to /bin/sh, and LOGNAME and HOME are set from the /etc/passwd line of the crontab´s owner.  HOME and
       SHELL can be overridden by settings in the crontab; LOGNAME can not.

       (Note: the LOGNAME variable is sometimes called USER on BSD systems and is also automatically set).

       In addition to LOGNAME, HOME, and SHELL, cron(8) looks at the MAILTO variable if a mail needs to be send as a result of running any commands in that particular crontab.  If MAILTO is defined (and
       non-empty),  mail  is  sent to the specified address.  If MAILTO is defined but empty (MAILTO=""), no mail is sent.  Otherwise, mail is sent to the owner of the crontab.  This option is useful if
       you decide to use /bin/mail instead of /usr/lib/sendmail as your mailer.  Note that /bin/mail does not provide aliasing and UUCP usually does not read its mail.  If MAILFROM is defined (and  non-
       empty), it is used as the envelope sender address, otherwise, ``root'' is used.

       (Note: Both MAILFROM and MAILTO variables are expanded, so setting them as in the following example works as expected: MAILFROM=cron-$USER@cron.com ($USER is replaced by the system user) )

       By  default, cron sends a mail using the 'Content-Type:' header of 'text/plain' with the 'charset=' parameter set to the 'charmap/codeset' of the locale in which crond(8) is started up, i.e., ei‐
       ther the default system locale, if no LC_* environment variables are set, or the locale specified by the LC_* environment variables (see locale(7)).  Different character encodings can be used for
       mailing cron job outputs by setting the CONTENT_TYPE and CONTENT_TRANSFER_ENCODING variables in a crontab to the correct values of the mail headers of those names.

       The  CRON_TZ variable specifies the time zone specific for the cron table.  The user should enter a time according to the specified time zone into the table.  The time used for writing into a log
       file is taken from the local time zone, where the daemon is running.

       The MLS_LEVEL environment variable provides support for multiple per-job SELinux security contexts in the same crontab.  By default, cron jobs execute with the default SELinux security context of
       the  user  that created the crontab file.  When using multiple security levels and roles, this may not be sufficient, because the same user may be running in different roles or in different secu‐
       rity levels.  For more information about roles and SELinux MLS/MCS, see selinux(8) and the crontab example mentioned later on in this text.  You can set the MLS_LEVEL variable to the SELinux  se‐
       curity context string specifying the particular SELinux security context in which you want jobs to be run.  crond will then set the execution context of those jobs that meet the specifications of
       the particular security context.  For more information, see crontab(1) -s option.

       The RANDOM_DELAY variable allows delaying job startups by random amount of minutes with upper limit specified by the variable. The random scaling factor  is  determined  during  the  cron  daemon
       startup so it remains constant for the whole run time of the daemon.

       The  format  of a cron command is similar to the V7 standard, with a number of upward-compatible extensions.  Each line has five time-and-date fields followed by a username (if this is the system
       crontab file), and followed by a command.  Commands are executed by cron(8) when the 'minute', 'hour', and 'month of the year' fields match the current time, and at least one  of  the  two  'day'
       fields ('day of month', or 'day of week') match the current time (see "Note" below).

       Note  that  this means that non-existent times, such as the "missing hours" during the daylight savings time conversion, will never match, causing jobs scheduled during the "missing times" not to
       be run.  Similarly, times that occur more than once (again, during the daylight savings time conversion) will cause matching jobs to be run twice.

       cron(8) examines cron entries every minute.

       The time and date fields are:

              field          allowed values
              -----          --------------
              minute         0-59
              hour           0-23
              day of month   1-31
              month          1-12 (or names, see below)
              day of week    0-7 (0 or 7 is Sunday, or use names)

       A field may contain an asterisk (*), which always stands for "first-last".

       Ranges of numbers are allowed.  Ranges are two numbers separated with a hyphen.  The specified range is inclusive.  For example, 8-11 for an 'hours' entry specifies execution at hours 8,  9,  10,
       and 11. The first number must be less than or equal to the second one.

       Randomization  of the execution time within a range can be used.  A random number within a range specified as two numbers separated with a tilde is picked.  The specified range is inclusive.  For
       example, 6~15 for a 'minutes' entry picks a random minute within 6 to 15 range.  The random number is picked when crontab file is parsed.  The first number must be less than or equal to the  sec‐
       ond one. You might omit one or both of the numbers specifying the range.  For example, ~ for a 'minutes' entry picks a random minute within 0 to 59 range.

       Lists are allowed.  A list is a set of numbers (or ranges) separated by commas.  Examples: "1,2,5,9", "0-4,8-12".

       Step  values can be used in conjunction with ranges.  Following a range with "/<number>" specifies skips of the number's value through the range.  For example, "0-23/2" can be used in the 'hours'
       field to specify command execution for every other hour (the alternative in the V7 standard is "0,2,4,6,8,10,12,14,16,18,20,22").  Step values are also permitted after an asterisk, so if specify‐
       ing a job to be run every two hours, you can use "*/2".

       Names  can also be used for the 'month' and 'day of week' fields.  Use the first three letters of the particular day or month (case does not matter).  Ranges and lists of names are allowed. Exam‐
       ples: "mon,wed,fri", "jan-mar".

       If the UID of the owner is 0 (root), the first character of a crontab entry can be "-" character. This will prevent cron from writing a syslog message about the command being executed.

       The "sixth" field (the rest of the line) specifies the command to be run.  The entire command portion of the line, up to a newline or a "%" character, will be executed by /bin/sh or by the  shell
       specified in the SHELL variable of the cronfile.  A "%" character in the command, unless escaped with a backslash (\), will be changed into newline characters, and all data after the first % will
       be sent to the command as standard input.

       Note: The day of a command's execution can be specified in the following two fields — 'day of month', and 'day of week'.  If both fields are restricted (i.e., do not contain the  "*"  character),
       the command will be run when either field matches the current time.  For example,
       "30 4 1,15 * 5" would cause a command to be run at 4:30 am on the 1st and 15th of each month, plus every Friday.

       A crontab file syntax can be tested before an install using the -T option. See crontab(1) for details.

EXAMPLE CRON FILE
       # use /bin/sh to run commands, no matter what /etc/passwd says
       SHELL=/bin/sh
       # mail any output to `paul', no matter whose crontab this is
       MAILTO=paul
       #
       CRON_TZ=Japan
       # run five minutes after midnight, every day
       5 0 * * *       $HOME/bin/daily.job >> $HOME/tmp/out 2>&1
       # run at 2:15pm on the first of every month -- output mailed to paul
       15 14 1 * *     $HOME/bin/monthly
       # run at 10 pm on weekdays, annoy Joe
       0 22 * * 1-5    mail -s "It's 10pm" joe%Joe,%%Where are your kids?%
       23 0-23/2 * * * echo "run 23 minutes after midn, 2am, 4am ..., everyday"
       5 4 * * sun     echo "run at 5 after 4 every sunday"

Jobs in /etc/cron.d/
       The jobs in cron.d and /etc/crontab are system jobs, which are used usually for more than one user, thus, additionally the username is needed.  MAILTO on the first line is optional.

EXAMPLE OF A JOB IN /etc/cron.d/job
       #login as root
       #create job with preferred editor (e.g. vim)
       MAILTO=root
       * * * * * root touch /tmp/file

SELinux with multi level security (MLS)
       In  a  crontab,  it  is  important  to  specify  a  security  level  by crontab -s or specifying the required level on the first line of the crontab.  Each level is specified in /etc/selinux/tar‐
       geted/seusers.  When using crontab in the MLS mode, it is especially important to:
       - check/change the actual role,
       - set correct role for directory, which is used for input/output.

EXAMPLE FOR SELINUX MLS
       # login as root
       newrole -r sysadm_r
       mkdir /tmp/SystemHigh
       chcon -l SystemHigh /tmp/SystemHigh
       crontab -e
       # write in crontab file
       MLS_LEVEL=SystemHigh
       0-59 * * * * id -Z > /tmp/SystemHigh/crontest

FILES
       /etc/crontab main system crontab file.  /var/spool/cron/ a directory for storing crontabs defined by users.  /etc/cron.d/ a directory for storing system crontabs.

EXTENSIONS
       These special time specification "nicknames" which replace the 5 initial time and date fields, and are prefixed with the '@' character, are supported:

       @reboot    :    Run once after reboot.
       @yearly    :    Run once a year, ie.  "0 0 1 1 *".
       @annually  :    Run once a year, ie.  "0 0 1 1 *".
       @monthly   :    Run once a month, ie. "0 0 1 * *".
       @weekly    :    Run once a week, ie.  "0 0 * * 0".
       @daily     :    Run once a day, ie.   "0 0 * * *".
       @hourly    :    Run once an hour, ie. "0 * * * *".

CAVEATS
       crontab files have to be regular files or symlinks to regular files, they must not be executable or writable for anyone else but the owner.  This requirement can be overridden by using the -p op‐
       tion on the crond command line.  If inotify support is in use, changes in the symlinked crontabs are not automatically noticed by the cron daemon.  The cron daemon must receive a SIGHUP signal to
       reload the crontabs.  This is a limitation of the inotify API.

       cron requires that each entry in a crontab end in a newline character.  If the last entry in a crontab is missing a newline (i.e. terminated by EOF), cron will consider the crontab (at least par‐
       tially) broken.  A warning will be written to syslog.
