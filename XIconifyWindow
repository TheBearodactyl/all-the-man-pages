NAME
       XIconifyWindow, XWithdrawWindow, XReconfigureWMWindow - manipulate top-level windows

SYNTAX
       Status XIconifyWindow(Display *display, Window w, int screen_number);

       Status XWithdrawWindow(Display *display, Window w, int screen_number);

       Status XReconfigureWMWindow(Display *display, Window w, int screen_number, unsigned int value_mask, XWindowChanges *values);

ARGUMENTS
       display   Specifies the connection to the X server.

       screen_number
                 Specifies the appropriate screen number on the host server.

       value_mask
                 Specifies which values are to be set using information in the values structure.  This mask is the bitwise inclusive OR of the valid configure window values bits.

       values    Specifies the XWindowChanges structure.

       w         Specifies the window.

DESCRIPTION
       The  XIconifyWindow  function sends a WM_CHANGE_STATE ClientMessage event with a format of 32 and a first data element of IconicState (as described in section 4.1.4 of the Inter-Client Communica‐
       tion Conventions Manual) and a window of w to the root window of the specified screen with an event mask set to SubstructureNotifyMask| SubstructureRedirectMask.  Window managers may elect to re‐
       ceive this message and if the window is in its normal state, may treat it as a request to change the window's state from normal to iconic.  If the WM_CHANGE_STATE property cannot be interned, XI‐
       conifyWindow does not send a message and returns a zero status.  It returns a nonzero status if the client message is sent successfully; otherwise, it returns a zero status.

       The XWithdrawWindow function unmaps the specified window and sends a synthetic UnmapNotify event to the root window of the specified screen.  Window managers may elect to receive this message and
       may  treat it as a request to change the window's state to withdrawn.  When a window is in the withdrawn state, neither its normal nor its iconic representations is visible.  It returns a nonzero
       status if the UnmapNotify event is successfully sent; otherwise, it returns a zero status.

       XWithdrawWindow can generate a BadWindow error.

       The XReconfigureWMWindow function issues a ConfigureWindow request on the specified top-level window.  If the stacking mode is changed and the request fails with a BadMatch error,  the  error  is
       trapped  by  Xlib  and a synthetic ConfigureRequestEvent containing the same configuration parameters is sent to the root of the specified window.  Window managers may elect to receive this event
       and treat it as a request to reconfigure the indicated window.  It returns a nonzero status if the request or event is successfully sent; otherwise, it returns a zero status.

       XReconfigureWMWindow can generate BadValue and BadWindow errors.

DIAGNOSTICS
       BadValue  Some numeric value falls outside the range of values accepted by the request.  Unless a specific range is specified for an argument, the full range defined by the argument's type is ac‐
                 cepted.  Any argument defined as a set of alternatives can generate this error.

       BadWindow A value for a Window argument does not name a defined Window.
