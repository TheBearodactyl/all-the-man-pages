Detailed Description
Function Documentation
   hwloc_const_cpuset_t hwloc_topology_get_allowed_cpuset (hwloc_topology_t topology)
       Get allowed CPU set.

       Returns
           the CPU set of allowed processors of the system.

       Note
           If the topology flag HWLOC_TOPOLOGY_FLAG_INCLUDE_DISALLOWED was not set, this is identical to hwloc_topology_get_topology_cpuset(), which means all PUs are allowed.

           If HWLOC_TOPOLOGY_FLAG_INCLUDE_DISALLOWED was set, applying hwloc_bitmap_intersects() on the result of this function and on an object cpuset checks whether there are allowed PUs inside that
           object. Applying hwloc_bitmap_and() returns the list of these allowed PUs.

           The returned cpuset is not newly allocated and should thus not be changed or freed, hwloc_bitmap_dup() must be used to obtain a local copy.

   hwloc_const_nodeset_t hwloc_topology_get_allowed_nodeset (hwloc_topology_t topology)
       Get allowed node set.

       Returns
           the node set of allowed memory of the system.

       Note
           If the topology flag HWLOC_TOPOLOGY_FLAG_INCLUDE_DISALLOWED was not set, this is identical to hwloc_topology_get_topology_nodeset(), which means all NUMA nodes are allowed.

           If HWLOC_TOPOLOGY_FLAG_INCLUDE_DISALLOWED was set, applying hwloc_bitmap_intersects() on the result of this function and on an object nodeset checks whether there are allowed NUMA nodes
           inside that object. Applying hwloc_bitmap_and() returns the list of these allowed NUMA nodes.

           The returned nodeset is not newly allocated and should thus not be changed or freed, hwloc_bitmap_dup() must be used to obtain a local copy.

   hwloc_const_cpuset_t hwloc_topology_get_complete_cpuset (hwloc_topology_t topology)
       Get complete CPU set.

       Returns
           the complete CPU set of processors of the system.

       Note
           The returned cpuset is not newly allocated and should thus not be changed or freed; hwloc_bitmap_dup() must be used to obtain a local copy.

           This is equivalent to retrieving the root object complete CPU-set.

   hwloc_const_nodeset_t hwloc_topology_get_complete_nodeset (hwloc_topology_t topology)
       Get complete node set.

       Returns
           the complete node set of memory of the system.

       Note
           The returned nodeset is not newly allocated and should thus not be changed or freed; hwloc_bitmap_dup() must be used to obtain a local copy.

           This is equivalent to retrieving the root object complete nodeset.

   hwloc_const_cpuset_t hwloc_topology_get_topology_cpuset (hwloc_topology_t topology)
       Get topology CPU set.

       Returns
           the CPU set of processors of the system for which hwloc provides topology information. This is equivalent to the cpuset of the system object.

       Note
           The returned cpuset is not newly allocated and should thus not be changed or freed; hwloc_bitmap_dup() must be used to obtain a local copy.

           This is equivalent to retrieving the root object CPU-set.

   hwloc_const_nodeset_t hwloc_topology_get_topology_nodeset (hwloc_topology_t topology)
       Get topology node set.

       Returns
           the node set of memory of the system for which hwloc provides topology information. This is equivalent to the nodeset of the system object.

       Note
           The returned nodeset is not newly allocated and should thus not be changed or freed; hwloc_bitmap_dup() must be used to obtain a local copy.

           This is equivalent to retrieving the root object nodeset.
