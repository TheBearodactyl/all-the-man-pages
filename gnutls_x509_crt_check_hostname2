NAME
       gnutls_x509_crt_check_hostname2 - API function

SYNOPSIS
       #include <gnutls/x509.h>

       unsigned gnutls_x509_crt_check_hostname2(gnutls_x509_crt_t cert, const char * hostname, unsigned int flags);

ARGUMENTS
       gnutls_x509_crt_t cert
                   should contain an gnutls_x509_crt_t type

       const char * hostname
                   A null terminated string that contains a DNS name

       unsigned int flags
                   gnutls_certificate_verify_flags

DESCRIPTION
       This function will check if the given certificate's subject matches the given hostname.  This is a basic implementation of the matching described in RFC6125, and takes into account wildcards, and
       the DNSName/IPAddress subject alternative name PKIX extension.

       IPv4 addresses are accepted by this function in the dotted-decimal format (e.g, ddd.ddd.ddd.ddd), and IPv6 addresses in the hexadecimal x:x:x:x:x:x:x:x format. For them the IPAddress subject  al‐
       ternative  name  extension  is  consulted. Previous versions to 3.6.0 of GnuTLS in case of a non-match would consult (in a non-standard extension) the DNSname and CN fields. This is no longer the
       case.

       When the flag GNUTLS_VERIFY_DO_NOT_ALLOW_WILDCARDS is specified no wildcards are considered. Otherwise they are only considered if the domain name consists of three components or  more,  and  the
       wildcard  starts at the leftmost position.  When the flag GNUTLS_VERIFY_DO_NOT_ALLOW_IP_MATCHES is specified, the input will be treated as a DNS name, and matching of textual IP addresses against
       the IPAddress part of the alternative name will not be allowed.

       The function gnutls_x509_crt_check_ip() is available for matching IP addresses.

RETURNS
       non-zero for a successful match, and zero on failure.

SINCE
       3.3.0
