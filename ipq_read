NAME
       ipq_read — read queue messages from ip_queue and read into supplied buffer

SYNOPSIS
       #include <linux/netfilter.h>
       #include <libipq.h>

       ssize_t ipq_read(const struct ipq_handle *h, unsigned char *buf, size_t len, int timeout);

DESCRIPTION
       The ipq_read function reads a queue message from the kernel and copies it to the memory pointed to by buf to a maximum length of len.

       The h parameter is a context handle which must previously have been returned successfully from a call to ipq_create_handle.

       The caller is responsible for ensuring that the memory pointed to by buf is large enough to contain len bytes.

       The  timeout  parameter may be used to set a timeout for the operation, specified in microseconds.  This is implemented internally by the library via the select system call.  A value of zero pro‐
       vides normal, backwards-compatible blocking behaviour with no timeout.  A negative value causes the function to return immediately.

       Data returned via buf should not be accessed directly.  Use the ipq_message_type, ipq_get_packet, and ipq_get_msgerr functions to access the queue message in the buffer.

RETURN VALUE
       On failure, -1 is returned.
       On success, a non-zero positive value is returned when no timeout value is specified.
       On success with a timeout value specified, zero is returned if no data was available to read, or if a non-blocked signal was caught.  In the latter case, the global errno value  will  be  set  to
       EINTR.

ERRORS
       On error, a descriptive error message will be available via the ipq_errstr function.

DIAGNOSTICS
       While the ipq_read function may return successfully, the queue message copied to the buffer may itself be an error message from a higher level kernel component.  Use ipq_message_type to determine
       if it is an error message, and ipq_get_msgerr to access the value of the message.

BUGS
       None known.
