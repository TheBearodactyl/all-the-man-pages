NAME
       i3lock-color - improved screen locker

SYNOPSIS
       i3lock [-v] [-n] [-b] [-i image.png] [-c color] [-t] [-p pointer] [-u] [-e] [-f] [-m]

DESCRIPTION
       i3lock-color is a simple screen locker like slock. After starting it, you will see a white screen (you can configure the color/an image). You can return to your screen by entering your password.

FEATURES
       • i3lock forks, so you can combine it with an alias to suspend to RAM (run "i3lock && echo mem > /sys/power/state" to get a locked screen after waking up your computer from suspend to RAM)

       • You can specify either a background color or a PNG image which will be displayed while your screen is locked.

       • You can specify whether i3lock should bell upon a wrong password.

       • i3lock uses PAM and therefore is compatible with LDAP, etc.

OPTIONS
       -v, --version
              Display the version of your i3lock

       -n, --nofork
              Don't fork after starting.

       -b, --beep
              Enable beeping. Be sure to not do this when you are about to annoy other people, like when opening your laptop in a boring lecture.

       -u, --no-unlock-indicator
              Disable  the  unlock  indicator.  i3lock will by default show an unlock indicator after pressing keys. This will give feedback for every keypress and it will show you the current PAM state
              (whether your password is currently being verified or whether it is wrong).

       -i path, --image=path
              Display the given PNG image instead of a blank screen.

       --raw=format
              Read the image given by --image as a raw image instead of PNG. The argument is the image's format as <width>x<height>:<pixfmt>.  The supported pixel formats are: ´native',  'rgb',  'xrgb',
              'rgbx', 'bgr', 'xbgr', and 'bgrx'.  The "native" pixel format expects a pixel as a 32-bit (4-byte) integer in the machine's native endianness, with the upper 8 bits unused.  Red, green and
              blue are stored in the remaining bits, in that order.

              Example:
                   --raw=1920x1080:rgb
              You can use ImageMagick’s convert(1) program to feed raw images into i3lock:

                   convert wallpaper.jpg RGB:- | i3lock --raw 3840x2160:rgb --image /dev/stdin
              This allows you to load a variety of image formats without i3lock having to support each one explicitly.  You can also use it to resize images to the screen ratio:

                   convert wallpaper.jpg -resize $(xdpyinfo | grep dimensions | sed -r 's/^[^0-9]*([0-9]+x[0-9]+).*$/1/') RGB:- | i3lock --raw $(xdpyinfo | grep dimensions | sed -r 's/^[^0-9]*([0-9]+x[0-9]+).*$/1/'):rgb --image /dev/stdin
              Note that $(xdpyinfo | grep dimensions | sed -r 's/^[^0-9]*([0-9]+x[0-9]+).*$/1/') gets you the current screen dimensions in the wxh (e.g. 1920x1080) format.

       -c rrggbbaa, --color=rrggbbaa
              Turn the screen into the given color instead of white. Color must be given in 4-byte format: rrggbbaa (i.e. ff0000ff is opaque red).  Use the last byte for alpha.  Setting  this  below  FF
              (i.e. ff000088) will allow your screen to be shown translucently if you use a compositor (e.g. compton, xcompmgr).

       -t, --tiling
              If an image is specified (via -i) it will display the image tiled all over the screen.

              Note: For all image options, with a multi-monitor setup, the image is visible on all screens.

       -C, --centered
              If an image is specified (via -i) it will display the image centered on the screen.

       -F, --fill
              If an image is specified (via -i) it will scale the image until it fills the screen. A portion of the image will be cropped.

       -M, --max
              If an image is specified (via -i) it will scale the image until either the width or the height fits the screen without being cropped. The border color can be set via -c.

       -L, --scale
              If an image is specified (via -i) it will stretch the image until both the width and the height fits the screen.

       -p win|default, --pointer=win|default
              If you specify "default", i3lock does not hide your mouse pointer. If you specify "win", i3lock displays a hardcoded Windows-Pointer (thus enabling you to mess with your friends by using a
              screenshot of a Windows desktop as a locking-screen).

       -e, --ignore-empty-password
              When an empty password is provided by the user, do not validate it. Without this option, the empty password will be provided to PAM and, if invalid, the user will have to wait a  few  sec‐
              onds before another try. This can be useful if the XF86ScreenSaver key is used to put a laptop to sleep and bounce on resume or if you happen to wake up your computer with the enter key.

       -f, --show-failed-attempts
              Show the number of failed attempts, if any.

       --debug
              Enables debug logging.  Note, that this will log the password used for authentication to stdout.

i3lock-color OPTIONS
       -S number, --screen=number
              Specifies which display to draw the unlock indicator and clock on. By default, they'll be placed on every screen.  Note that this number is zero indexed. The ordering is dependent on libx‐
              inerama.

       -B sigma, --blur=sigma
              Captures the screen and blurs it using the given sigma (radius).  Images may still be overlaid over the blurred screenshot.  As an alternative to this option, you could specify a  translu‐
              cent background color (-c option) with a fully transparent or translucent color, and use a compositor to perform blurring (e.g. compton, picom).

       -k, --clock, --force-clock
              Displays the clock. --force-clock also displays the clock when there's indicator text (useful for when the clock is not positioned with the indicator).

       --indicator
              Forces the indicator to always be visible, instead of only showing on activity.

       --radius
              The radius of the circle. Defaults to 90.

       --ring-width
              The width of the ring unlock indicator. Defaults to 7.0.

       --{inside, ring}-color=rrggbbaa
              Sets  the idle color for the interior circle and ring.  Note: use individual options per element unless the shell supports brace expansion (in which case remove the spaces inside the curly
              braces).

       --{inside, ring}ver-color=rrggbbaa
              Sets the interior circle and ring color while the password is being verified.

       --{inside, ring}wrong-color=rrggbbaa
              Sets the interior circle and ring color for during incorrect password flashes.

       --line-color=rrggbbaa
              Sets the color for the line separating the inside circle and the outer ring.

       --line-uses-{inside, ring}
              Overrides --line-color. The line will match the {inside, ring} color.  Note: these two options conflict with each other.

       --{key, bs}hl-color=rrggbbaa
              Sets the color of highlight arcs on the ring upon keypress and backspace.

       --separator-color=rrggbbaa
              Sets the color of the seperators at both ends of the highlight arcs on the ring.

       --{verif, wrong, modif}-color=rrggbbaa
              Sets the color of the status text while verifying and when password is wrong.

       --{layout, time, date, greeter}-color=rrggbbaa
              Sets text colors.

       --time-str="%H:%M:%S"
              Sets the format used for generating the time string.  See strftime(3) for a full list of format specifiers.

       --date-str="%A, %m %Y"
              Sets the format used for generating the date string.

       --verif-text="verifying…"
              Sets the string to be shown while verifying the password/input/key/etc.

       --wrong-text="wrong!"
              Sets the string to be shown upon entering an incorrect password.

       --keylayout mode
              Displays the keylayout. Positionable similar to date, time, and indicator.  Modes are as follows:

              • 0 - Displays the full string returned by the query, i.e. "English (US)"

              • 1 - Displays up until the first parenthesis, i.e. "English"

              • 2 - Displays just the contents of the parenthesis, i.e. "US"

       --noinput-text="no input"
              Sets the string to be shown upon pressing backspace without anything to delete.

       --lock-text="locking…"
              Sets the string to be shown while acquiring pointer and keyboard focus.

       --lockfailed-text="lock failed!"
              Sets the string to be shown after failing to acquire pointer and keyboard focus.

       --greeter-text=""

       --{time, date, layout, verif, wrong, modif, greeter}-align
              Sets the text alignment of the time, date, keylayout, verification, wrong, modifier and greeter texts.

              • 0 - centered (default)

              • 1 - left aligned

              • 2 - right aligned

       --{time, date, layout, verif, wrong, greeter, modif}outline-color=rrggbbaa

              Sets the position for the unlock indicator. Valid variables include:

              • x - x position of the current display.
                    Corresponds to the leftmost column of pixels on that display.

              • y - y position of the current display.
                    Corresponds to the topmost row of pixels on that display.

              • w - width of the current display.

              • h - height of the current display.

              • r - unlock indicator radius.

       --time-pos="x-position:y-position"
              Sets the position for the time string. All the variables from --ind-pos may be used, in addition to:

              • ix - x position of the indicator on the current display.

              • iy - y position of the indicator on the current display.

                If the --bar-indicator option is used, the following variables may be used:

              • bw - width of the bar indicator.

              • bx - x position of the bar indicator on the current display.

              • by - y position of the bar indicator on the current display.

       --date-pos="x-position:y-position"
              Sets the position for the date string. All the variables from --ind-pos and --time-pos may be used, in addition to:

              • tx - x position of the timestring on the current display.

              • ty - y position of the timestring on the current display.

       --greeter-pos="x-position:y-position"
              Sets the position for the greeter string. All the variables from --ind-pos and --time-pos may be used.

       --pass-{media, screen, power, volume}-keys
              Allow the following keys to be used normally while the screen is locked by passing them through:

              • media - XF86AudioPlay, XF86AudioPause, XF86AudioStop, XF86AudioPrev,
                        XF86AudioNext, XF86AudioMute, XF86AudioLowerVolume, XF86AudioRaiseVolume

              • screen - XF86MonBrightnessUp, XF86MonBrightnessDown

              • power - XF86PowerDown, XF86PowerOff, XF86Sleep

              • volume - XF86AudioMute, XF86AudioLowerVolume, XF86AudioRaiseVolume

       --bar-indicator
              Replaces the usual ring indicator with a bar indicator. Comes with perks.

       --bar-direction={0, 1, 2}
              Sets the direction the bars grow in. 0 is the default (downwards, or rightwards, depending on the bar orientation). 1 is the reverse, and 2 is both.

       --bar-orientation={vertical,horizontal}
              Sets whether the bar is vertically or horizontally oriented.  Defaults to horizontal.

       --bar-step
              Sets the step that each bar decreases by when a key is pressed. A random bar is set to its max height, then each neighbor is set to (height - step*distance).

       --bar-max-height
              The maximum height a bar can get to. When a key is pressed, a random bar is set to this value, then its neighbors are set to its height, minus the step value.

       --bar-base-width
              The thickness of the "base" bar that all the bars originate from.  This bar also takes on the ring verification and wrong colors to give authentication feedback.

       --bar-color
              Sets the default color of the bar base.

       --bar-periodic-step
              The value by which the bars decrease each time the screen is redrawn.

       --bar-pos
              Works similarly to the time/date/indicator expressions. If only one number is provided, this sets the vertical offset from the top or left edge. If two numbers are provided in the form  of
              x:y, sets the starting position of the bar.

       --bar-count
              Sets the number of minibars to draw on each screen.

       --bar-total-width
              The total width of the bar. Can be an expression.

       --redraw-thread
              Starts a separate thread for redrawing the screen. Potentially worse from a security standpoint, but makes the bar indicator still do its usual periodic redraws when PAM is authenticating.

       --refresh-rate=seconds-as-double
              The refresh rate of the indicator, given in seconds. This should automatically align itself, but is somewhat buggy currently.  Values less than one will work, but may result in poor system
              performance.

       --composite
              Some compositors have problems with i3lock trying to render over them, so this argument is disabled by default. However, some will work properly with it, so it's been left enabled.

       --no-verify
              Do not verify the password entered by the user and unlock immediately.  Use only for quickly testing new configurations and remember to remove to actually lock your screen!

       --slideshow-interval
              The interval to wait until switching to the next image.

       --slideshow-random-selection
              Randomize the order of the images.
