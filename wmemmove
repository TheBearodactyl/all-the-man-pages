NAME
       wmemmove - copy an array of wide-characters

LIBRARY
       Standard C library (libc, -lc)

SYNOPSIS
       #include <wchar.h>

       wchar_t *wmemmove(wchar_t dest[.n], const wchar_t src[.n], size_t n);

DESCRIPTION
       The  wmemmove()  function  is  the wide-character equivalent of the memmove(3) function.  It copies n wide characters from the array starting at src to the array starting at dest.  The arrays may
       overlap.

       The programmer must ensure that there is room for at least n wide characters at dest.

RETURN VALUE
       wmemmove() returns dest.

PROLOG

       the interface may not be implemented on Linux.

NAME
       wmemmove — copy wide characters in memory with overlapping areas

SYNOPSIS
       #include <wchar.h>

       wchar_t *wmemmove(wchar_t *ws1, const wchar_t *ws2, size_t n);

DESCRIPTION
       The functionality described on this reference page is aligned with the ISO C standard. Any conflict between the requirements described here and the ISO C standard is unintentional. This volume of
       POSIX.1‐2017 defers to the ISO C standard.

       The  wmemmove()  function  shall  copy  n  wide characters from the object pointed to by ws2 to the object pointed to by ws1.  Copying shall take place as if the n wide characters from the object
       pointed to by ws2 are first copied into a temporary array of n wide characters that does not overlap the objects pointed to by ws1 or ws2, and then the n wide characters from the temporary  array
       are copied into the object pointed to by ws1.

       This  function  shall  not be affected by locale and all wchar_t values shall be treated identically. The null wide character and wchar_t values not corresponding to valid characters shall not be
       treated specially.

       If n is zero, the application shall ensure that ws1 and ws2 are valid pointers, and the function shall copy zero wide characters.

RETURN VALUE
       The wmemmove() function shall return the value of ws1.
