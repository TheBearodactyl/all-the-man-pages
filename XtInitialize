NAME
       XtInitialize - initialize

SYNTAX
       #include <X11/Intrinsic.h>

       Widget XtInitialize(const char *shell_name, const char *application_class, XrmOptionDescRec* options, Cardinal num_options, int* argc, char** argv);

ARGUMENTS
       shell_name
                 Specifies the name of the created shell widget.

       application_class
                 Specifies the class name of this application, which usually is the generic name for all instances of this application.

       options   Specifies how to parse the command line for any application-specific resources.  The options argument is passed as a parameter to XrmParseCommand.  For further information, see Xlib - C
                 Language X Interface.

       num_options
                 Specifies the number of entries in the options list.

       argc      Specifies a pointer to the number of command line parameters.

       argv      Specifies the command line parameters.

DESCRIPTION
       XtInitialize calls XtToolkitInitialize followed by XtOpenDisplay with display_string NULL and application_name NULL, and finally calls XtAppCreateShell with application_name NULL, widget_class
       applicationShellWidgetClass, and the specified args and num_args and returns the created shell.  The semantics of calling XtInitialize more than once are undefined.  This routine has been re‚Äê
       placed by XtAppInitialize.
