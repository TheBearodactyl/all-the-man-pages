NAME
       gnutls_fips140_push_context - API function

SYNOPSIS
       #include <gnutls/gnutls.h>

       int gnutls_fips140_push_context(gnutls_fips140_context_t context);

ARGUMENTS
       gnutls_fips140_context_t context
                   a gnutls_fips140_context_t

DESCRIPTION
       Associate the FIPS  context to the current thread, diverting the currently active context. If a cryptographic operation is ongoing in the current thread, e.g., gnutls_aead_cipher_init() is called
       but gnutls_aead_cipher_deinit() is not yet called, it returns an error GNUTLS_E_INVALID_REQUEST.

       The operation state of  context will be reset to GNUTLS_FIPS140_OP_INITIAL.

       This function is no-op if FIPS140 is not compiled in nor enabled at run-time.

RETURNS
       0 upon success, a negative error code otherwise
