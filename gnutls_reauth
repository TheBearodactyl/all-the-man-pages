NAME
       gnutls_reauth - API function

SYNOPSIS
       #include <gnutls/gnutls.h>

       int gnutls_reauth(gnutls_session_t session, unsigned int flags);

ARGUMENTS
       gnutls_session_t session
                   is a gnutls_session_t type.

       unsigned int flags
                   must be zero

DESCRIPTION
       This  function  performs  the  post-handshake  authentication  for  TLS  1.3.  The  post-handshake  authentication  is  initiated  by  the  server  by  calling this function. Clients respond when
       GNUTLS_E_REAUTH_REQUEST has been seen while receiving data.

       The non-fatal errors expected by this function are: GNUTLS_E_INTERRUPTED, GNUTLS_E_AGAIN, as well as GNUTLS_E_GOT_APPLICATION_DATA when called on server side.

       The former two interrupt the authentication procedure due to the transport layer being interrupted, and the latter because there were pending data prior to peer initiating the  re-authentication.
       The server should read/process that data as unauthenticated and retry calling gnutls_reauth().

       When  this  function is called under TLS1.2 or earlier or the peer didn't advertise post-handshake auth, it always fails with GNUTLS_E_INVALID_REQUEST. The verification of the received peers cer‐
       tificate is delegated to the session or credentials verification callbacks. A server can check whether post handshake authentication is supported by the client by checking the session flags  with
       gnutls_session_get_flags().

       Prior  to calling this function in server side, the function gnutls_certificate_server_set_request() must be called setting expectations for the received certificate (request or require). If none
       are set this function will return with GNUTLS_E_INVALID_REQUEST.

       Note that post handshake authentication is available irrespective of the initial negotiation type (PSK or certificate). In all cases however, certificate credentials must be set  to  the  session
       prior to calling this function.

RETURNS
       GNUTLS_E_SUCCESS on a successful authentication, otherwise a negative error code.
