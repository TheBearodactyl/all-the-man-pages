NAME
       gnutls_ext_raw_parse - API function

SYNOPSIS
       #include <gnutls/gnutls.h>

       int gnutls_ext_raw_parse(void * ctx, gnutls_ext_raw_process_func cb, const gnutls_datum_t * data, unsigned int flags);

ARGUMENTS
       void * ctx  a pointer to pass to callback function

       gnutls_ext_raw_process_func cb
                   callback function to process each extension found

       const gnutls_datum_t * data
                   TLS extension data

       unsigned int flags
                   should be zero or GNUTLS_EXT_RAW_FLAG_TLS_CLIENT_HELLO or GNUTLS_EXT_RAW_FLAG_DTLS_CLIENT_HELLO

DESCRIPTION
       This function iterates through the TLS extensions as passed in
        data , passing the individual extension data to callback. The
        data must conform to Extension extensions<0..2^16-1> format.

       If flags is GNUTLS_EXT_RAW_TLS_FLAG_CLIENT_HELLO then this function will parse the extension data from the position, as if the packet in
        data is a client hello (without record or handshake headers) - as provided by gnutls_handshake_set_hook_function().

       The return value of the callback will be propagated.

RETURNS
       GNUTLS_E_SUCCESS on success, or an error code. On unknown flags it returns GNUTLS_E_INVALID_REQUEST.

SINCE
       3.6.3
