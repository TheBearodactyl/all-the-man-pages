DESCRIPTION
       To free possible data stored into an XpmImage structure use XpmFreeXpmImage().  The XpmFreeXpmImage() function frees the structure members which are not NULL, but not the structure itself.

       To free possible data stored into an XpmInfo structure use XpmFreeXpmInfo().

       To free data possibly stored into an array of XpmExtension use XpmFreeExtensions().

       To  free any data allocated by an XPM function use the XpmFree() function.  The current distribution of the XPM library uses the standard memory allocation functions and thus XpmFree() is nothing
       else than a define to the standard free(3).  However since these functions may be redefined in specific environments it is wise to use XpmFree()

       To free possible data stored into an XpmAttributes structure use XpmFreeAttributes().  The XpmFreeAttributes() function frees the structure members which have been malloc’ed such  as  the  pixels
       list.

       To  dynamically  allocate an XpmAttributes structure use the XpmAttributesSize() function.  The XpmAttributesSize() function provides applications using dynamic libraries with a safe way to allo‐
       cate and then refer to an XpmAttributes structure, disregarding whether the XpmAttributes structure size has changed or not since compiled.

       To get data when building an error message, one can use XpmGetErrorString().  XpmGetErrorString() returns a string related to the given XPM error code.

       The XpmLibraryVersion() function can be used when one needs to figure out which version of the library is in use.  The value returned by XpmLibraryVersion() can be compared to the value of XpmIn‐
       cludeVersion which is defined in the header file "xpm.h".  These numbers are computed with the following formula:

        (XpmFormat * 100 + XpmVersion) * 100 + XpmRevision

       where XpmFormat is the version number of the format, XpmVersion is the library version number (which changes only if the API changes), and XpmRevision is the library minor version number.

       The  XpmFreeExtensions() function frees all data stored in every extension and the array itself.  Note that XpmFreeAttributes() calls this function and thus most of the time it should not need to
       be explicitly called.
