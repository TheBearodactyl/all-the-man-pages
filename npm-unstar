   Configuration
   registry
       • Default: "https://registry.npmjs.org/"

       • Type: URL

       The base URL of the npm registry.

   unicode
       • Default: false on windows, true on mac/unix systems with a unicode locale, as defined by the LC_ALL, LC_CTYPE, or LANG environment variables.

       • Type: Boolean

       When set to true, npm uses unicode characters in the tree output. When false, it uses ascii characters instead of unicode glyphs.

   otp
       • Default: null

       • Type: null or String

       This is a one-time password from a two-factor authenticator. It's needed when publishing or changing package permissions with npm access.

       If not set, and a registry response fails with a challenge for a one-time password, npm will prompt on the command line for one.
