NAME
       gnutls_x509_privkey_import_openssl - API function

SYNOPSIS
       #include <gnutls/x509.h>

       int gnutls_x509_privkey_import_openssl(gnutls_x509_privkey_t key, const gnutls_datum_t * data, const char * password);

ARGUMENTS
       gnutls_x509_privkey_t key
                   The data to store the parsed key

       const gnutls_datum_t * data
                   The DER or PEM encoded key.

       const char * password
                   the password to decrypt the key (if it is encrypted).

DESCRIPTION
       This function will convert the given PEM encrypted to the native gnutls_x509_privkey_t format. The output will be stored in  key .

       The  password should be in ASCII. If the password is not provided or wrong then GNUTLS_E_DECRYPTION_FAILED will be returned.

       If the Certificate is PEM encoded it should have a header of "PRIVATE KEY" and the "DEK-Info" header.
