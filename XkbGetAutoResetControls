NAME
       XkbGetAutoResetControls - Gets the current values of the auto-reset controls

SYNOPSIS
       Bool XkbGetAutoResetControls (Display *dpy, unsigned int  *auto_ctrls, unsigned int  *auto_values);

ARGUMENTS
       dpy    connection to X server

       auto_ctrls
              specifies which bits in auto_values are relevant

       auto_values
              1 bit => corresponding control has auto-reset on

DESCRIPTION
       You  can configure the boolean controls to automatically be enabled or disabled when a program exits. This capability is controlled via two masks maintained in the X server on a per-client basis.
       There is no client-side Xkb data structure corresponding to these masks. Whenever the client exits for any reason, any boolean controls specified in the auto-reset mask are set to the correspond‐
       ing value from the auto-reset values mask. This makes it possible for clients to "clean up after themselves" automatically, even if abnormally terminated. The bits used in the masks correspond to
       the EnabledControls control bits.

       For example, a client that replaces the keyboard bell with some other audible cue might want to turn off the AudibleBell control to prevent the server from also generating a sound and  avoid  ca‐
       cophony.  If  the client were to exit without resetting the AudibleBell control, the user would be left without any feedback at all. Setting AudibleBell in both the auto-reset mask and auto-reset
       values guarantees that the audible bell will be turned back on when the client exits.

       XkbGetAutoResetControls backfills auto_ctrls and auto_values with the AutoReset control attributes for this particular client. It returns True if successful, and False otherwise.

RETURN VALUES
       True           The XkbGetAutoResetControls function returns True when it successfully backfills auto_ctrls and auto_values with the AutoReset control attributes for this particular client.

       False          The XkbGetAutoResetControls function returns False when it does not successfully backfill auto_ctrls and auto_values with the  AutoReset  control  attributes  for  this  particular
                      client.
