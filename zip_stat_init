NAME
     zip_stat_init â€” initialize zip_stat structure

LIBRARY
     libzip (-lzip)

SYNOPSIS
     #include <zip.h>

     void
     zip_stat_init(zip_stat_t *sb);

DESCRIPTION
     The zip_stat_init() function initializes the members of a struct zip_stat.  The current members are described in zip_stat(3), but this function should be used to initialize it to make sure none are
     missed.  The structure pointed to by sb must be allocated before calling zip_stat_init().

     This function should be used by functions provided to zip_source_function(3) when returning ZIP_SOURCE_STAT information to make sure all fields are initialized.

RETURN VALUES
     If sb is valid, the function is always successful.

SEE ALSO
     libzip(3), zip_stat(3)

HISTORY
     zip_stat_init() was added in libzip 0.8.
