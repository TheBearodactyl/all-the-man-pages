NAME
       Test2::Event::Generic - Generic event type.

DESCRIPTION
       This is a generic event that lets you customize all fields in the event API.  This is useful if you have need for a custom event that does not make sense as a published reusable event subclass.

SYNOPSIS
           use Test2::API qw/context/;

           sub send_custom_fail {
               my $ctx = shift;

               $ctx->send_event('Generic', causes_fail => 1, summary => 'The sky is falling');

               $ctx->release;
           }

           send_custom_fail();

METHODS
       $e->facet_data($data)
       $data = $e->facet_data
           Get or set the facet data (see Test2::Event). If no facet_data is set then "Test2::Event->facet_data" will be called to produce facets from the other data.

       $e->callback($hub)
           Call the custom callback if one is set, otherwise this does nothing.

       $e->set_callback(sub { ... })
           Set the custom callback. The custom callback must be a coderef. The first argument to your callback will be the event itself, the second will be the Test2::Event::Hub that is using the
           callback.

       $bool = $e->causes_fail
       $e->set_causes_fail($bool)
           Get/Set the "causes_fail" attribute. This defaults to 0.

       $bool = $e->diagnostics
       $e->set_diagnostics($bool)
           Get/Set the "diagnostics" attribute. This defaults to 0.

       $bool_or_undef = $e->global
       @bool_or_empty = $e->global
       $e->set_global($bool_or_undef)
           Get/Set the "diagnostics" attribute. This defaults to an empty list which is undef in scalar context.

       $bool = $e->increments_count
       $e->set_increments_count($bool)
           Get/Set the "increments_count" attribute. This defaults to 0.

       $bool = $e->no_display
       $e->set_no_display($bool)
           Get/Set the "no_display" attribute. This defaults to 0.

       @plan = $e->sets_plan
           Get the plan if this event sets one. The plan is a list of up to 3 items: "($count, $directive, $reason)". $count must be defined, the others may be undef, or may not exist at all.

       $e->set_sets_plan(\@plan)
           Set the plan. You must pass in an arrayref with up to 3 elements.

       $summary = $e->summary
       $e->set_summary($summary_or_undef)
           Get/Set the summary. This will default to the event package 'Test2::Event::Generic'. You can set it to any value. Setting this to "undef" will reset it to the default.

       $int_or_undef = $e->terminate
       @int_or_empty = $e->terminate
       $e->set_terminate($int_or_undef)
           This will get/set the "terminate" attribute. This defaults to undef in scalar context, or an empty list in list context. Setting this to undef will clear it completely. This must be set to a
           positive integer (0 or larger).
