NAME
       gnutls_x509_crt_get_subject - API function

SYNOPSIS
       #include <gnutls/x509.h>

       int gnutls_x509_crt_get_subject(gnutls_x509_crt_t cert, gnutls_x509_dn_t * dn);

ARGUMENTS
       gnutls_x509_crt_t cert
                   should contain a gnutls_x509_crt_t type

       gnutls_x509_dn_t * dn
                   output variable with pointer to uint8_t DN.

DESCRIPTION
       Return the Certificate's Subject DN as a gnutls_x509_dn_t data type, that can be decoded using gnutls_x509_dn_get_rdn_ava().

       Note that  dn should be treated as constant. Because it points into the  cert object, you should not use  dn after  cert is deallocated.

RETURNS
