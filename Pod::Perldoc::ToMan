Pod::Perldoc::ToMan(3pePerl Programmers Reference GuPod::Perldoc::ToMan(3perl)

NAME
       Pod::Perldoc::ToMan - let Perldoc render Pod as man pages

SYNOPSIS
         perldoc -o man Some::Modulename

DESCRIPTION
       This is a "plug-in" class that allows Perldoc to use Pod::Man and
       "groff" for reading Pod pages.

       The following options are supported:  center, date, fixed, fixedbold,
       fixeditalic, fixedbolditalic, quotes, release, section

       (Those options are explained in Pod::Man.)

       For example:

         perldoc -o man -w center:Pod Some::Modulename

CAVEAT
       This module may change to use a different pod-to-nroff formatter class
       in the future, and this may change what options are supported.
