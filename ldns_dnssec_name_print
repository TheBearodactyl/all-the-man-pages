DESCRIPTION
       ldns_dnssec_name_new() Create a new data structure for a dnssec name
              Returns the allocated structure

       ldns_dnssec_name_new_frm_rr() Create a new data structure for a dnssec name for the given RR

              rr: the RR to derive properties from, and to add to the name

       ldns_dnssec_name_free() Frees the name structure and its rrs and rrsets.  Individual ldns_rr records therein are not freed

              name: the structure to free

       ldns_dnssec_name_name() Returns the domain name of the given dnssec_name structure

              name: the dnssec name to get the domain name from
              Returns the domain name

       ldns_dnssec_name_set_name() Sets the domain name of the given dnssec_name structure

              name: the dnssec name to set the domain name of
              dname: the domain name to set it to. This data is *not* copied.

       ldns_dnssec_name_set_nsec() Sets the NSEC(3) RR of the given dnssec_name structure

              name: the dnssec name to set the domain name of
              nsec: the nsec rr to set it to. This data is *not* copied.

       ldns_dnssec_name_cmp() Compares the domain names of the two arguments in their canonical ordering.

              a: The first dnssec_name to compare
              b: The second dnssec_name to compare
              Returns -1 if the domain name of a comes before that of b in canonical ordering, 1 if it is the other way around, and 0 if they are equal

       ldns_dnssec_name_add_rr() Inserts the given rr at the right place in the current dnssec_name No checking is done whether the name matches

              name: The ldns_dnssec_name to add the RR to
              rr: The RR to add
              Returns LDNS_STATUS_OK on success, error code otherwise

       ldns_dnssec_name_find_rrset() Find the RRset with the given type in within this name structure

              name: the name to find the RRset in
              type: the type of the RRset to find
              Returns the RRset, or NULL if not present

       ldns_dnssec_name_print() Prints the RRs in the  dnssec name structure to the given file descriptor

              out: the file descriptor to print to
              name: the name structure to print the contents of
