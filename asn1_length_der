NAME
       asn1_length_der - API function

SYNOPSIS
       #include <libtasn1.h>

       void asn1_length_der(unsigned long int len, unsigned char * der, int * der_len);

ARGUMENTS
       unsigned long int len
                   value to convert.

       unsigned char * der
                   buffer to hold the returned encoding (may be NULL).

       int * der_len
                   number of meaningful bytes of ANS (der[0]..der[der_len-1]).

DESCRIPTION
       Creates the DER encoding of the provided length value.  The  der buffer must have enough room for the output. The maximum length this function will encode is ASN1_MAX_LENGTH_SIZE.

       To know the size of the DER encoding use a NULL value for  der .
