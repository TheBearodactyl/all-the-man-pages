NAME
       gnutls_privkey_import_ext3 - API function

SYNOPSIS
       #include <gnutls/abstract.h>

       int   gnutls_privkey_import_ext3(gnutls_privkey_t   pkey,  void  *  userdata,  gnutls_privkey_sign_func  sign_fn,  gnutls_privkey_decrypt_func  decrypt_fn,  gnutls_privkey_deinit_func  deinit_fn,
       gnutls_privkey_info_func info_fn, unsigned int flags);

ARGUMENTS
       gnutls_privkey_t pkey
                   The private key

       void * userdata
                   private data to be provided to the callbacks

       gnutls_privkey_sign_func sign_fn
                   callback for signature operations

       gnutls_privkey_decrypt_func decrypt_fn
                   callback for decryption operations

       gnutls_privkey_deinit_func deinit_fn
                   a deinitialization function

       gnutls_privkey_info_func info_fn
                   returns info about the public key algorithm (should not be NULL)

       unsigned int flags
                   Flags for the import

DESCRIPTION
       This function will associate the given callbacks with the gnutls_privkey_t type. At least one of the two callbacks must be non-null. If a deinitialization function is provided then flags  is  as‐
       sumed to contain GNUTLS_PRIVKEY_IMPORT_AUTO_RELEASE.

       Note  that the signing function is supposed to "raw" sign data, i.e., without any hashing or preprocessing. In case of RSA the DigestInfo will be provided, and the signing function is expected to
       do the PKCS 1 1.5 padding and the exponentiation.

       The  info_fn must provide information on the algorithms supported by this private key, and should support the flags GNUTLS_PRIVKEY_INFO_PK_ALGO and GNUTLS_PRIVKEY_INFO_SIGN_ALGO. It  must  return
       -1 on unknown flags.

RETURNS
       On success, GNUTLS_E_SUCCESS (0) is returned, otherwise a negative error value.

SINCE
       3.4.0
