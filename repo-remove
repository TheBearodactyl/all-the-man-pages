REPO-ADD(8)                      Pacman Manual                     REPO-ADD(8)

NAME
       repo-add - package database maintenance utility

SYNOPSIS
       repo-add [options] <path-to-db> <package> [<package> ...]

       repo-remove [options] <path-to-db> <packagename> [<packagename> ...]

DESCRIPTION
       repo-add and repo-remove are two scripts to help build a package
       database for packages built with makepkg(8) and installed with
       pacman(8).

       repo-add will update a package database by reading a built package
       file. Multiple packages to add can be specified on the command line.

       If a matching “.sig” file is found alongside a package file, the
       signature will automatically be embedded into the database.

       repo-remove will update a package database by removing the package name
       specified on the command line. Multiple packages to remove can be
       specified on the command line.

       A package database is a tar file, optionally compressed. Valid
       extensions are “.db” followed by an archive extension of “.tar”,
       “.tar.gz”, “.tar.bz2”, “.tar.xz”, or “.tar.Z”. The file does not need
       to exist, but all parent directories must exist.

COMMON OPTIONS
       -q, --quiet
           Force this program to keep quiet and run silently except for
           warning and error messages.

       -s, --sign
           Generate a PGP signature file using GnuPG. This will execute gpg
           --detach-sign --use-agent on the generated database to generate a
           detached signature file, using the GPG agent if it is available.
           The signature file will be the entire filename of the database with
           a “.sig” extension.

       -k, --key <key>
           Specify a key to use when signing packages. Can also be specified
           using the GPGKEY environmental variable. If not specified in either
           location, the default key from the keyring will be used.

       -v, --verify
           Verify the PGP signature of the database before updating the
           database. If the signature is invalid, an error is produced and the
           update does not proceed.

       --nocolor
           Remove color from repo-add and repo-remove output.

REPO-ADD OPTIONS
       -n, --new
           Only add packages that are not already in the database. Warnings
           will be printed upon detection of existing packages, but they will
           not be re-added.

       -R, --remove
           Remove old package files from the disk when updating their entry in
           the database.

EXAMPLE
       repo-add foo.db.tar.xz <pkg1> [<pkg2> ...]

       This creates two separate databases; a smaller database “foo.db.tar.xz”
       used by pacman and a large database containing package file lists
       “foo.files.tar.xz” for use by other utilities. While pacman can use the
       large database (if renamed with a db.tar* extension), there is
       currently no additional benefit for the larger download.

BUGS
       Bugs? You must be kidding; there are no bugs in this software. But if
       we happen to be wrong, submit a bug report with as much detail as
       possible at the Arch Linux Bug Tracker in the Pacman section.
