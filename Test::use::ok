NAME
       Test::use::ok - Alternative to Test::More::use_ok

SYNOPSIS
           use ok 'Some::Module';

DESCRIPTION
       According to the Test::More documentation, it is recommended to run "use_ok()" inside a "BEGIN" block, so functions are exported at compile-time and prototypes are properly honored.

       That is, instead of writing this:

           use_ok( 'Some::Module' );
           use_ok( 'Other::Module' );

       One should write this:

           BEGIN { use_ok( 'Some::Module' ); }
           BEGIN { use_ok( 'Other::Module' ); }

       However, people often either forget to add "BEGIN", or mistakenly group "use_ok" with other tests in a single "BEGIN" block, which can create subtle differences in execution order.

       With this module, simply change all "use_ok" in test scripts to "use ok", and they will be executed at "BEGIN" time.  The explicit space after "use" makes it clear that this is a single compile-
       time action.
