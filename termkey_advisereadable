TERMKEY_ADVISEREADABLE(3)                                                                Library Functions Manual                                                                TERMKEY_ADVISEREADABLE(3)

NAME
       termkey_advisereadable - read more bytes from the underlying terminal

SYNOPSIS
       #include <termkey.h>

       TermKeyResult termkey_advisereadable(TermKey *tk);

       Link with -ltermkey.

DESCRIPTION
       termkey_advisereadable()  informs  the  termkey(7) instance that new input may be available on the underlying file descriptor and so it should call read(2) to obtain it. If at least one more byte
       was read it will return TERMKEY_RES_AGAIN to indicate it may be useful to call termkey_getkey(3) again. If no more input was read then TERMKEY_RES_NONE is returned. If there was no  buffer  space
       remaining, then TERMKEY_RES_ERROR is returned with errno set to ENOMEM. If no filehandle is associated with this instance, TERMKEY_RES_ERROR is returned with errno set to EBADF.

       This  function,  along  with  termkey_getkey(3)  make  it  possible  to  use  the  termkey  instance  in  an  asynchronous  program.  To  provide  bytes  without using a readable file handle, use
       termkey_push_bytes(3).

       For synchronous usage, termkey_waitkey(3) performs the input blocking task.

RETURN VALUE
       termkey_advisereadable() returns one of the following constants:

       TERMKEY_RES_AGAIN
              At least one byte was read.

       TERMKEY_RES_NONE
              No nore bytes were read.

       TERMKEY_RES_ERROR
              An IO error occurred. errno will be preserved. If the error is EINTR then this will only be returned if TERMKEY_FLAG_EINTR flag is not set; if it is then the IO operation will  be  retried
              instead.
