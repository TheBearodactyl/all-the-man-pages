       #include <libaudit.h>

       int audit_get_reply(int fd, struct audit_reply *rep, reply_t block, int peek);

DESCRIPTION
       This  function  gets  the  next data packet sent on the audit netlink socket. This function is usually called after sending a command to the audit system. fd should be an open file descriptor re‚Äê
       turned by audit_open. rep should be a data structure to put the reply in. block is of type reply_t which is either: GET_REPLY_BLOCKING and GET_REPLY_NONBLOCKING. peek, if non-zero, gets the  data
       without dequeueing it from the netlink socket.
