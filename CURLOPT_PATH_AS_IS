NAME
       CURLOPT_PATH_AS_IS - do not handle dot dot sequences

SYNOPSIS
       #include <curl/curl.h>

       CURLcode curl_easy_setopt(CURL *handle, CURLOPT_PATH_AS_IS, long leaveit);

DESCRIPTION
       Set the long leaveit to 1, to explicitly tell libcurl to not alter the given path before passing it on to the server.

       This instructs libcurl to NOT squash sequences of "/../" or "/./" that may exist in the URL's path part and that is supposed to be removed according to RFC 3986 section 5.2.4.

       Some server implementations are known to (erroneously) require the dot dot sequences to remain in the path and some clients want to pass these on in order to try out server implementations.

       By default libcurl will merge such sequences before using the path.

DEFAULT
       0

PROTOCOLS
       All

EXAMPLE
       CURL *curl = curl_easy_init();
       if(curl) {
         curl_easy_setopt(curl, CURLOPT_URL, "https://example.com/../../etc/password");

         curl_easy_setopt(curl, CURLOPT_PATH_AS_IS, 1L);

         curl_easy_perform(curl);
       }

AVAILABILITY
       Added in 7.42.0

RETURN VALUE
       Returns CURLE_OK if the option is supported, and CURLE_UNKNOWN_OPTION if not.
