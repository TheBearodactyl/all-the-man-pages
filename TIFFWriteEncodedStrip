NAME
       TIFFWriteEncodedStrip - compress and write a strip of data to an open TIFF file

SYNOPSIS
          #include <tiffio.h>

       tsize_t TIFFWriteEncodedStrip(TIFF *tif, tstrip_t strip, tdata_t buf, tsize_t size)

DESCRIPTION
       Compress  size  bytes  of raw data from buf and write the result to the specified strip; replacing any previously written data. Note that the value of strip is a “raw strip number”.  That is, the
       caller must take into account whether or not the data are organized in separate planes (PlanarConfiguration = 2).

NOTES
       The library writes encoded data using the native machine byte order.  Correctly implemented TIFF readers are expected to do any necessary  byte-swapping  to  correctly  process  image  data  with
       BitsPerSample greater than 8.

       The  strip number must be valid according to the current settings of the ImageLength and RowsPerStrip tags.  An image may be dynamically grown by increasing the value of ImageLength prior to each
       call to TIFFWriteEncodedStrip.

RETURN VALUES
       -1 is returned if an error was encountered. Otherwise, the value of size is returned.

DIAGNOSTICS
       All error messages are directed to the TIFFErrorExtR() routine.

       %s: File not open for writing:
          The file was opened for reading, not writing.

       Can not write scanlines to a tiled image:
          The image is assumed to be organized in tiles because the TileWidth and TileLength tags have been set with TIFFSetField().

       %s: Must set "ImageWidth" before writing data\fP:
          The image’s width has not be set before the first write. See TIFFSetField() for information on how to do this.

       %s: Must set "PlanarConfiguration" before writing data:
          The organization of data has not be defined before the first write. See TIFFSetField() for information on how to do this.

       %s: No space for strip arrays":
          There was not enough space for the arrays that hold strip offsets and byte counts.
