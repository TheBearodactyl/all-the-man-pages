SSL_GET_FD(3ssl)                    OpenSSL                   SSL_GET_FD(3ssl)

NAME
       SSL_get_fd, SSL_get_rfd, SSL_get_wfd - get file descriptor linked to an
       SSL object

SYNOPSIS
        #include <openssl/ssl.h>

        int SSL_get_fd(const SSL *ssl);
        int SSL_get_rfd(const SSL *ssl);
        int SSL_get_wfd(const SSL *ssl);

DESCRIPTION
       SSL_get_fd() returns the file descriptor which is linked to ssl.
       SSL_get_rfd() and SSL_get_wfd() return the file descriptors for the
       read or the write channel, which can be different. If the read and the
       write channel are different, SSL_get_fd() will return the file
       descriptor of the read channel.

RETURN VALUES
       The following return values can occur:

       -1  The operation failed, because the underlying BIO is not of the
           correct type (suitable for file descriptors).

       >=0 The file descriptor linked to ssl.
