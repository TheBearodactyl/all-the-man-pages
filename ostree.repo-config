NAME
       ostree.repo-config - OSTree repository configuration

DESCRIPTION
       The config file in an OSTree repository is a "keyfile" in the XDG
       Desktop Entry Specification[1] format. It has several global flags, as
       well as zero or more remote entries which describe how to access remote
       repositories.

       See ostree.repo(5) for more information about OSTree repositories.

[CORE] SECTION OPTIONS
       Repository-global options. The following entries are defined:

       mode
           One of bare, bare-user, bare-user-only, or archive-z2 (note that
           archive is used everywhere else.)

       repo_version
           Currently, this must be set to 1.

       auto-update-summary
           Boolean value controlling whether or not to automatically update
           the summary file after any ref is added, removed, or updated. Other
           modifications which may render a summary file stale (like static
           deltas, or collection IDs) do not currently trigger an auto-update.

       commit-update-summary
           This option is deprecated. Use auto-update-summary instead, for
           which this option is now an alias.

       fsync
           Boolean value controlling whether or not to ensure files are on
           stable storage when performing operations such as commits, pulls,
           and checkouts. Defaults to true.

           If you disable fsync, OSTree will no longer be robust against
           kernel crashes or power loss.

           You might choose to disable this for local development
           repositories, under the assumption they can be recreated from
           source. Similarly, you could disable for a mirror where you could
           re-pull.

           For the system repository, you might choose to disable fsync if you
           have uninterruptable power supplies and a well tested kernel.

       per-object-fsync
           By default, OSTree will batch fsync() after writing everything;
           however, this can cause latency spikes for other processes which
           are also invoking fsync(). Turn on this boolean to reduce potential
           latency spikes, at the cost of slowing down OSTree updates. You
           most likely want this on by default for "background" OS updates.

       min-free-space-percent
           Integer percentage value (0-99) that specifies a minimum percentage
           of total space (in blocks) in the underlying filesystem to keep
           free. The default value is 3, which is enforced when neither this
           option nor min-free-space-size are set.

           If min-free-space-size is set to a non-zero value,
           min-free-space-percent is ignored. Note that,
           min-free-space-percent is not enforced on metadata objects. It is
           assumed that metadata objects are relatively small in size compared
           to content objects and thus kept outside the scope of this option.

       min-free-space-size
           Value (in power-of-2 MB, GB or TB) that specifies a minimum space
           in the underlying filesystem to keep free. Examples of acceptable
           values: 500MB (524 288 000 bytes), 1GB (1 073 741 824 bytes), 1TB
           (1 099 511 627 776 bytes).

           If this option is set to a non-zero value, and
           min-free-space-percent is also set, this option takes priority.
           Note that, min-free-space-size is not enforced on metadata objects.
           It is assumed that metadata objects are relatively small in size
           compared to content objects and thus kept outside the scope of this
           option.

       add-remotes-config-dir
           Boolean value controlling whether new remotes will be added in the
           remotes configuration directory. Defaults to true for system ostree
           repositories. When this is false, remotes will be added in the
           repository's config file.

           This only applies to repositories that use a remotes configuration
           directory such as system ostree repositories, which use
           /etc/ostree/remotes.d. Non-system repositories do not use a remotes
           configuration directory unless one is specified when the repository
           is opened.

       payload-link-threshold
           An integer value that specifies a minimum file size for creating a
           payload link. By default it is disabled.

       collection-id
           A reverse DNS domain name under your control, which enables peer to
           peer distribution of refs in this repository. See the
           --collection-id section in ostree-init(1)

       locking
           Boolean value controlling whether or not OSTree does repository
           locking internally. This uses file locks and is hence for multiple
           process exclusion (e.g. Flatpak and OSTree writing to the same
           repository separately). This is enabled by default since 2018.5.

       lock-timeout-secs
           Integer value controlling the number of seconds to block while
           attempting to acquire a lock (see above). A value of -1 means block
           indefinitely. The default value is 30.

       default-repo-finders
           Semicolon separated default list of finders (sources for refs) to
           use when pulling. This can be used to disable pulling from mounted
           filesystems, peers on the local network, or the Internet. However
           note that it only applies when a set of finders isn't explicitly
           specified, either by a consumer of libostree API or on the command
           line. Possible values: config, lan, and mount (or any combination
           thereof). If unset, this defaults to config;mount; (since the LAN
           finder is costly).

       no-deltas-in-summary
           Boolean value controlling whether OSTree should skip putting an
           index of available deltas in the summary file. Defaults to false.

           Since 2020.7 OSTree can use delta indexes outside the summary file,
           making the summary file smaller (especially for larger
           repositories). However by default we still create the index in the
           summary file to make older clients work. If you know all clients
           will be 2020.7 later you can enable this to save network bandwidth.

[REMOTE  NAME"] SECTION OPTIONS"
       Describes a remote repository location.

       url
           Must be present; declares URL for accessing metadata and content
           for remote. See also contenturl. The supported schemes are
           documented below.

       contenturl
           Declares URL for accessing content (filez, static delta parts).
           When specified, url is used just for metadata: summary, static
           delta "superblocks".

       branches
           A list of strings. Represents the default configured branches to
           fetch from the remote when no specific branches are requested
           during a pull operation.

       proxy
           A string value, if given should be a URL for a HTTP proxy to use
           for access to this repository.

       gpg-verify
           A boolean value, defaults to true. Controls whether or not OSTree
           will require commits to be signed by a known GPG key. For more
           information, see the ostree(1) manual under GPG.

       gpg-verify-summary
           A boolean value, defaults to false. Controls whether or not OSTree
           will check if the summary is signed by a known GPG key. For more
           information, see the ostree(1) manual under GPG.

       tls-permissive
           A boolean value, defaults to false. By default, server TLS
           certificates will be checked against the system certificate store.
           If this variable is set, any certificate will be accepted.

       tls-client-cert-path
           Path to file for client-side certificate, to present when making
           requests to this repository.

       tls-client-key-path
           Path to file containing client-side certificate key, to present
           when making requests to this repository.

       tls-ca-path
           Path to file containing trusted anchors instead of the system CA
           database.

       http2
           A boolean value, defaults to true. By default, libostree will use
           HTTP2; setting this to false will disable it. May be useful to work
           around broken servers.

       unconfigured-state
           If set, pulls from this remote will fail with the configured text.
           This is intended for OS vendors which have a subscription process
           to access content.

       custom-backend
           If set, pulls from this remote via libostree will fail with an
           error that mentions the value. It is recommended to make this a
           software identifier token (e.g. "examplecorp-fetcher"), not
           freeform text ("ExampleCorp Fetcher"). This is intended to be used
           by higher level software that wants to fetch ostree commits via
           some other mechanism, while still reusing the core libostree
           infrastructure around e.g. signatures.

[SYSROOT] SECTION OPTIONS
       Options for the sysroot, which contains the OSTree repository,
       deployments, and stateroots. The following entries are defined:

       bootloader
           Configure the bootloader that OSTree uses when deploying the
           sysroot. This may take the values bootloader=none, bootloader=auto,
           bootloader=grub2, bootloader=syslinux, bootloader=uboot or
           bootloader=zipl. Default is auto.

           If none, then OSTree will generate only BLS (Boot Loader
           Specification) fragments in sysroot/boot/loader/entries/ for the
           deployment.

           If auto, then in addition to generating BLS fragments, OSTree will
           dynamically check for the existence of grub2, uboot, and syslinux
           bootloaders. If one of the bootloaders is found, then OSTree will
           generate a config for the bootloader found. For example,
           grub2-mkconfig is run for the grub2 case.

           A specific bootloader type may also be explicitly requested by
           choosing grub2, syslinux, uboot or zipl.

       bls-append-except-default
           A semicolon seperated string list of key-value pairs. For example:
           bls-append-except-default=key1=value1;key2=value2. These key-value
           pairs will be injected into the generated BLS fragments of the
           non-default deployments. In other words, the BLS fragment of the
           default deployment will be unaffected by bls-append-except-default.

       bootprefix
           A boolean value; defaults to false. If set to true, the bootloader
           entries generated will include /boot as a prefix. This will likely
           be turned on by default in the future.

/ETC/OSTREE/REMOTES.D
       In addition to the /ostree/repo/config file, remotes may also be
       specified in /etc/ostree/remotes.d. The remote configuration file must
       end in .conf; files whose name does not end in .conf will be ignored.

REPOSITORY URL/CONTENTURL
       Originally, OSTree had just a url option for remotes. Since then, the
       contenturl option was introduced. Both of these support file, http, and
       https schemes.

       Additionally, both of these can be prefixed with the string
       mirrorlist=, which instructs the client that the target url is a
       "mirrorlist" format, which is a plain text file of newline-separated
       URLs. Earlier URLs will be given precedence.

       Note that currently, the tls-ca-path and tls-client-cert-path options
       apply to every HTTP request, even when contenturl and/or mirrorlist are
       in use. This may change in the future to only apply to metadata (i.e.
       url, not contenturl) fetches.

PER-REMOTE GPG KEYRINGS AND VERIFICATION
       OSTree supports a per-remote GPG keyring, as well as a gpgkeypath
       option. For more information see ostree(1). in the section GPG
       verification.

PER-REMOTE HTTP COOKIES
       Some content providers may want to control access to remote
       repositories via HTTP cookies. The ostree remote add-cookie and ostree
       remote delete-cookie commands will update a per-remote lookaside cookie
       jar, named $remotename.cookies.txt.
