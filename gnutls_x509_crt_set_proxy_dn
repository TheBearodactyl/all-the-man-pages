NAME
       gnutls_x509_crt_set_proxy_dn - API function

SYNOPSIS
       #include <gnutls/x509.h>

       int gnutls_x509_crt_set_proxy_dn(gnutls_x509_crt_t crt, gnutls_x509_crt_t eecrt, unsigned int raw_flag, const void * name, unsigned int sizeof_name);

ARGUMENTS
       gnutls_x509_crt_t crt
                   a gnutls_x509_crt_t type with the new proxy cert

       gnutls_x509_crt_t eecrt
                   the end entity certificate that will be issuing the proxy

       unsigned int raw_flag
                   must be 0, or 1 if the CN is DER encoded

       const void * name
                   a pointer to the CN name, may be NULL (but MUST then be added later)

       unsigned int sizeof_name
                   holds the size of  name

DESCRIPTION
       This function will set the subject in  crt to the end entity's
        eecrt  subject  name,  and add a single Common Name component  name of size  sizeof_name .  This corresponds to the required proxy certificate naming style.  Note that if  name is NULL, you MUST
       set it later by using gnutls_x509_crt_set_dn_by_oid() or similar.

RETURNS
       On success, GNUTLS_E_SUCCESS (0) is returned, otherwise a negative error value.
