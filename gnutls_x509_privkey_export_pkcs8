NAME
       gnutls_x509_privkey_export_pkcs8 - API function

SYNOPSIS
       #include <gnutls/x509.h>

       int gnutls_x509_privkey_export_pkcs8(gnutls_x509_privkey_t key, gnutls_x509_crt_fmt_t format, const char * password, unsigned int flags, void * output_data, size_t * output_data_size);

ARGUMENTS
       gnutls_x509_privkey_t key
                   Holds the key

       gnutls_x509_crt_fmt_t format
                   the format of output params. One of PEM or DER.

       const char * password
                   the password that will be used to encrypt the key.

       unsigned int flags
                   an ORed sequence of gnutls_pkcs_encrypt_flags_t

       void * output_data
                   will contain a private key PEM or DER encoded

       size_t * output_data_size
                   holds the size of output_data (and will be replaced by the actual size of parameters)

DESCRIPTION
       This function will export the private key to a PKCS8 structure.  Both RSA and DSA keys can be exported. For DSA keys we use PKCS 11 definitions. If the flags do not specify the encryption cipher,
       then the default 3DES (PBES2) will be used.

       The  password can be either ASCII or UTF-8 in the default PBES2 encryption schemas, or ASCII for the PKCS12 schemas.

       If the buffer provided is not long enough to hold the output, then *output_data_size is updated and GNUTLS_E_SHORT_MEMORY_BUFFER will be returned.

       If the structure is PEM encoded, it will have a header of "BEGIN ENCRYPTED PRIVATE KEY" or "BEGIN PRIVATE KEY" if encryption is not used.

RETURNS
       In case of failure a negative error code will be returned, and 0 on success.
