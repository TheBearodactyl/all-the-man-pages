NAME
     zip_source_seek_write â€” set write offset in zip source

LIBRARY
     libzip (-lzip)

SYNOPSIS
     #include <zip.h>

     int
     zip_source_seek_write(zip_source_t *source, zip_int64_t offset, int whence);

DESCRIPTION
     The function zip_source_seek_write() sets the current write offset for source.  Just like in fseek(3), depending on the whence argument, the offset is counted relative from:

           SEEK_SET    start of file

           SEEK_CUR    current write offset in file

           SEEK_END    end of file

RETURN VALUES
     Upon successful completion 0 is returned.  Otherwise, -1 is returned and the error information in source is set to indicate the error.
