NAME
       gnutls_init - API function

SYNOPSIS
       #include <gnutls/gnutls.h>

       int gnutls_init(gnutls_session_t * session, unsigned int flags);

ARGUMENTS
       gnutls_session_t * session
                   is a pointer to a gnutls_session_t type.

       unsigned int flags
                   indicate if this session is to be used for server or client.

DESCRIPTION
       This function initializes the provided session. Every session must be initialized before use, and after successful initialization and use must be deinitialized by calling gnutls_deinit().

        flags can be any combination of flags from gnutls_init_flags_t.

       Note  that  since  version  3.1.2  this  function enables some common TLS extensions such as session tickets and OCSP certificate status request in client side by default. To prevent that use the
       GNUTLS_NO_EXTENSIONS flag.

       Note that it is never mandatory to use gnutls_deinit() after this function fails.  Since gnutls 3.8.0, it is safe to unconditionally use gnutls_deinit() even after failure regardless  of  whether
       the  memory  was initialized prior to gnutls_init(); however, clients wanting to be portable to older versions of the library should either skip deinitialization on failure, or pre-initialize the
       memory passed in to gnutls_init() to all zeroes via memset() or similar.

RETURNS
       GNUTLS_E_SUCCESS on success, or an error code.
