NAME
       XkbFreeGeometry - Free an entire geometry

SYNOPSIS
       void XkbFreeGeometry (XkbGeometryPtr geom, unsigned int which, Bool free_all);

ARGUMENTS
       geom   geometry to be freed

       which  mask of geometry components to be freed

       free_all
              True => the entire geometry is freed

DESCRIPTION
       Xkb  provides a number of functions to allocate and free subcomponents of a keyboard geometry. Use these functions to create or modify keyboard geometries.  Note that these functions merely allo‚Äê
       cate space for the new element(s), and it is up to you to fill in the values explicitly in your code. These allocation functions increase sz_* but never touch num_* (unless there is an allocation
       failure,  in which case they reset both sz_* and num_* to zero). These functions return Success if they succeed, BadAlloc if they are not able to allocate space, or BadValue if a parameter is not
       as expected.

       The values of which and free_all determine how much of the specified geometry is freed. The valid values for which are:

           #define   XkbGeomPropertiesMask      (1<<0)
           #define   XkbGeomColorsMask          (1<<1)
           #define   XkbGeomShapesMask          (1<<2)
           #define   XkbGeomSectionsMask        (1<<3)
           #define   XkbGeomDoodadsMask         (1<<4)
           #define   XkbGeomKeyAliasesMask      (1<<5)
           #define   XkbGeomAllMask             (0x3f)

       If free_all is True, the entire geometry is freed regardless of the value of which.  Otherwise, the portions of the geometry specified by which are freed.

DIAGNOSTICS
       BadAlloc       Unable to allocate storage

       BadValue       An argument is out of range
