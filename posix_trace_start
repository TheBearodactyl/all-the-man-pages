POSIX_TRACE_START(3P)      POSIX Programmer's Manual     POSIX_TRACE_START(3P)

PROLOG
       This  manual  page is part of the POSIX Programmer's Manual.  The Linux
       implementation of this interface may differ (consult the  corresponding
       Linux  manual page for details of Linux behavior), or the interface may
       not be implemented on Linux.

NAME
       posix_trace_start, posix_trace_stop — trace start and stop (TRACING)

SYNOPSIS
       #include <trace.h>

       int posix_trace_start(trace_id_t trid);
       int posix_trace_stop (trace_id_t trid);

DESCRIPTION
       The posix_trace_start() and posix_trace_stop() functions, respectively,
       shall start and stop the trace stream identified by the argument trid.

       The  effect  of  calling  the  posix_trace_start()  function  shall  be
       recorded in the trace stream  as  the  POSIX_TRACE_START  system  trace
       event  and the status of the trace stream shall become POSIX_TRACE_RUN‐
       NING.  If the trace stream is in progress when this function is called,
       the  POSIX_TRACE_START system trace event shall not be recorded and the
       trace stream shall continue to run. If the trace stream  is  full,  the
       POSIX_TRACE_START system trace event shall not be recorded and the sta‐
       tus of the trace stream shall not be changed.

       The effect of calling the posix_trace_stop() function shall be recorded
       in  the trace stream as the POSIX_TRACE_STOP system trace event and the
       status of the trace stream shall become POSIX_TRACE_SUSPENDED.  If  the
       trace   stream   is   suspended  when  this  function  is  called,  the
       POSIX_TRACE_STOP system trace event shall not be recorded and the trace
       stream  shall  remain  suspended.  If  the  trace  stream  is full, the
       POSIX_TRACE_STOP system trace event shall not be recorded and the  sta‐
       tus of the trace stream shall not be changed.

RETURN VALUE
       Upon  successful  completion,  these  functions shall return a value of
       zero. Otherwise, they shall return the corresponding error number.

ERRORS
       These functions shall fail if:

       EINVAL The value of the argument trid does not correspond to an  active
              trace stream and thus no trace stream was started or stopped.

       EINTR  The  operation  was  interrupted  by a signal and thus the trace
              stream was not necessarily started or stopped.

       The following sections are informative.

EXAMPLES
       None.

APPLICATION USAGE
       None.

RATIONALE
       None.

FUTURE DIRECTIONS
       The posix_trace_start() and posix_trace_stop() functions may be removed
       in a future version.
