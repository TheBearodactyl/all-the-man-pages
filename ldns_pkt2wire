NAME
       ldns_rr2wire, ldns_pkt2wire, ldns_rdf2wire - conversion functions

SYNOPSIS
       #include <stdint.h>
       #include <stdbool.h>

       #include <ldns/ldns.h>

       ldns_status ldns_rr2wire(uint8_t **dest, const ldns_rr *rr, int section, size_t *size);

       ldns_status ldns_pkt2wire(uint8_t **dest, const ldns_pkt *p, size_t *size);

       ldns_status ldns_rdf2wire(uint8_t **dest, const ldns_rdf *rdf, size_t *size);

DESCRIPTION
       ldns_rr2wire() Allocates an array of uint8_t at dest, and puts the wireformat of the given rr in that array. The result_size value contains the length of the array, if it succeeds, and 0 other‐
              wise (in which case the function also returns NULL)

              If the section argument is LDNS_SECTION_QUESTION, data like ttl and rdata are not put into the result

              dest: pointer to the array of bytes to be created
              rr: the rr to convert
              section: the rr section, determines how the rr is written.
              size: the size of the converted result

       ldns_pkt2wire() Allocates an array of uint8_t at dest, and puts the wireformat of the given packet in that array. The result_size value contains the length of the array, if it succeeds, and 0
              otherwise (in which case the function also returns NULL)

              dest: pointer to the array of bytes to be created
              p: the packet to convert
              size: the size of the converted result

       ldns_rdf2wire() Allocates an array of uint8_t at dest, and puts the wireformat of the given rdf in that array. The result_size value contains the length of the array, if it succeeds, and 0 other‐
              wise (in which case the function also returns NULL)

              dest: pointer to the array of bytes to be created
              rdf: the rdata field to convert
              size: the size of the converted result
