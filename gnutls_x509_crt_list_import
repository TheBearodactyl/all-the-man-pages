NAME
       gnutls_x509_crt_list_import - API function

SYNOPSIS
       #include <gnutls/x509.h>

       int gnutls_x509_crt_list_import(gnutls_x509_crt_t * certs, unsigned int * cert_max, const gnutls_datum_t * data, gnutls_x509_crt_fmt_t format, unsigned int flags);

ARGUMENTS
       gnutls_x509_crt_t * certs
                   Indicates where the parsed list will be copied to. Must not be initialized.

       unsigned int * cert_max
                   Initially must hold the maximum number of certs. It will be updated with the number of certs available.

       const gnutls_datum_t * data
                   The PEM encoded certificate.

       gnutls_x509_crt_fmt_t format
                   One of DER or PEM.

       unsigned int flags
                   must be (0) or an OR'd sequence of gnutls_certificate_import_flags.

DESCRIPTION
       This function will convert the given PEM encoded certificate list to the native gnutls_x509_crt_t format. The output will be stored in  certs .  They will be automatically initialized.

       The   flag   GNUTLS_X509_CRT_LIST_IMPORT_FAIL_IF_EXCEED   will   cause   import   to   fail   if   the   certificates  in  the  provided  buffer  are  more  than  the  available  structures.  The
       GNUTLS_X509_CRT_LIST_FAIL_IF_UNSORTED flag will cause the function to fail if the provided list is not sorted from subject to issuer.

       If the Certificate is PEM encoded it should have a header of "X509 CERTIFICATE", or "CERTIFICATE".

RETURNS
       the number of certificates read or a negative error value.
