NAME
       gnutls_x509_dn_import - API function

SYNOPSIS
       #include <gnutls/x509.h>

       int gnutls_x509_dn_import(gnutls_x509_dn_t dn, const gnutls_datum_t * data);

ARGUMENTS
       gnutls_x509_dn_t dn
                   the structure that will hold the imported DN

       const gnutls_datum_t * data
                   should contain a DER encoded RDN sequence

DESCRIPTION
       This  function parses an RDN sequence and stores the result to a gnutls_x509_dn_t type. The data must have been initialized with gnutls_x509_dn_init(). You may use gnutls_x509_dn_get_rdn_ava() to
       decode the DN.

RETURNS
