NAME
       ares_gethostbyaddr - Initiate a host query by address

SYNOPSIS
       #include <ares.h>

       typedef void (*ares_host_callback)(void *arg, int status,
                                          int timeouts,
                                          struct hostent *hostent)

       void ares_gethostbyaddr(ares_channel channel, const void *addr,
                               int addrlen, int family,
                               ares_host_callback callback, void *arg)

DESCRIPTION
       The  ares_gethostbyaddr  function  initiates a host query by address on the name service channel identified by channel.  The parameters addr and addrlen give the address as a series of bytes, and
       family gives the type of address.  When the query is complete or has failed, the ares library will invoke callback.  Completion or failure of the query may happen immediately, or may happen  dur‐
       ing a later call to ares_process(3), ares_destroy(3) or ares_cancel(3).

       The  callback  argument arg is copied from the ares_gethostbyaddr argument arg.  The callback argument status indicates whether the query succeeded and, if not, how it failed.  It may have any of
       the following values:

       ARES_SUCCESS       The host lookup completed successfully.

       ARES_ENOTIMP       The ares library does not know how to look up addresses of type family.

       ARES_ENOTFOUND     The address addr was not found.

       ARES_ENOMEM        Memory was exhausted.

       ARES_ECANCELLED    The query was cancelled.

       ARES_EDESTRUCTION  The name service channel channel is being destroyed; the query will not be completed.

       The callback argument timeouts reports how many times a query timed out during the execution of the given request.

       On successful completion of the query, the callback argument hostent points to a struct hostent containing the name of the host returned by the query.  The callback need not and  should  not  at‐
       tempt to free the memory pointed to by hostent; the ares library will free it when the callback returns.  If the query did not complete successfully, hostent will be NULL.
