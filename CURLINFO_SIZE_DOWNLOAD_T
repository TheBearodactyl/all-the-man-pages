NAME
       CURLINFO_SIZE_DOWNLOAD_T - get the number of downloaded bytes

SYNOPSIS
       #include <curl/curl.h>

       CURLcode curl_easy_getinfo(CURL *handle, CURLINFO_SIZE_DOWNLOAD_T,
                                  curl_off_t *dlp);

DESCRIPTION
       Pass  a  pointer  to a curl_off_t to receive the total amount of bytes that were downloaded.  The amount is only for the latest transfer and will be reset again for each new transfer. This counts
       actual payload data, what's also commonly called body. All meta and header data are excluded and will not be counted in this number.

PROTOCOLS

EXAMPLE
       CURL *curl = curl_easy_init();
       if(curl) {
         curl_easy_setopt(curl, CURLOPT_URL, "https://example.com");

         /* Perform the request */
         res = curl_easy_perform(curl);

         if(!res) {
           /* check the size */
           curl_off_t dl;
           res = curl_easy_getinfo(curl, CURLINFO_SIZE_DOWNLOAD_T, &dl);
           if(!res) {
             printf("Downloaded %" CURL_FORMAT_CURL_OFF_T " bytes\n", dl);
           }
         }
