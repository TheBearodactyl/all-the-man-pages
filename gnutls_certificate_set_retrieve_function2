NAME
       gnutls_certificate_set_retrieve_function2 - API function

SYNOPSIS
       #include <gnutls/abstract.h>

       void gnutls_certificate_set_retrieve_function2(gnutls_certificate_credentials_t cred, gnutls_certificate_retrieve_function2 * func);

ARGUMENTS
       gnutls_certificate_credentials_t cred
                   is a gnutls_certificate_credentials_t type.

       gnutls_certificate_retrieve_function2 * func
                   is the callback function

DESCRIPTION
       This function sets a callback to be called in order to retrieve the certificate to be used in the handshake. The callback will take control only if a certificate is requested by the peer.

       The  callback's  function prototype is: int (*callback)(gnutls_session_t, const gnutls_datum_t* req_ca_dn, int nreqs, const gnutls_pk_algorithm_t* pk_algos, int pk_algos_length, gnutls_pcert_st**
       pcert, unsigned int *pcert_length, gnutls_privkey_t * pkey);

        req_ca_dn is only used in X.509 certificates.  Contains a list with the CA names that the server considers trusted.  This is a hint and typically the client should send  a  certificate  that  is
       signed by one of these CAs. These names, when available, are DER encoded. To get a more meaningful value use the function gnutls_x509_rdn_get().

        pk_algos contains a list with server's acceptable public key algorithms.  The certificate returned should support the server's given algorithms.

        pcert should contain a single certificate and public key or a list of them.

        pcert_length is the size of the previous list.

        pkey is the private key.

       If  the callback function is provided then gnutls will call it, in the handshake, after the certificate request message has been received.  All the provided by the callback values will not be re‐
       leased or modified by gnutls.

       In server side pk_algos and req_ca_dn are NULL.

       The callback function should set the certificate list to be sent, and return 0 on success. If no certificate was selected then the number of certificates should be set to zero. The value (-1) in‐
       dicates error and the handshake will be terminated. If both certificates are set in the credentials and a callback is available, the callback takes predence.
