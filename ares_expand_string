NAME
       ares_expand_string - Expand a length encoded string

SYNOPSIS
       #include <ares.h>

       int ares_expand_string(const unsigned char *encoded,
                              const unsigned char *abuf, int alen,
                              unsigned char **s, long *enclen)

DESCRIPTION
       The  ares_expand_string  function  converts  a length encoded string to a NUL-terminated C string.  The argument encoded gives the beginning of the encoded string, and the arguments abuf and alen
       give the containing message buffer (necessary for the processing of indirection pointers within the encoded domain name).  The result is placed in a NUL-terminated allocated buffer, a pointer  to
       which  is  stored  in the variable pointed to by s.  The length of the encoded string is stored in the variable pointed to by enclen so that the caller can advance past the encoded string to read
       further data in the message.

RETURN VALUES
       ares_expand_string can return any of the following values:

       ARES_SUCCESS   Expansion of the encoded string succeeded.

       ARES_EBADSTR   The encoded string was malformed and could not be expanded.

       ARES_ENOMEM    Memory was exhausted.
