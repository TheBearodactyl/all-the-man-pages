NAME
       audisp-remote - plugin for remote logging

SYNOPSIS
       audisp-remote

DESCRIPTION
       audisp-remote is a plugin for the audit event dispatcher that preforms remote logging to an aggregate logging server.

TIPS
       If  you  are  aggregating  multiple machines, you should edit auditd.conf to set the name_format to something meaningful and the log_format to enriched. This way you can tell where the event came
       from and have the user name and groups resolved locally before it is sent off of the machine.

SIGNALS
       SIGUSR1
              Causes the audisp-remote program to write the value of some of its internal flags to syslog. The suspend flag tells whether or not logging has been suspended. The remote_ended  flag  tells
              if  the  connection was broken by the server saying it can't log events. The transport_ok flag tells whether or not the connection to the remote server is healthy. The queue_size tells how
              many records are enqueued to be sent to the remote server.

       SIGUSR2
              Causes the audisp-remote program to resume logging if it were suspended due to an error.
