NAME
       libssh2_channel_read_ex - read data from a channel stream

SYNOPSIS
       #include <libssh2.h>

       ssize_t libssh2_channel_read_ex(LIBSSH2_CHANNEL *channel, int stream_id, char *buf, size_t buflen);

       ssize_t libssh2_channel_read(LIBSSH2_CHANNEL *channel, char *buf, size_t buflen);

       ssize_t libssh2_channel_read_stderr(LIBSSH2_CHANNEL *channel, char *buf, size_t buflen);

DESCRIPTION
       Attempt  to  read  data from an active channel stream. All channel streams have one standard I/O substream (stream_id == 0), and may have up to 2^32 extended data streams as identified by the se‚Äê
       lected stream_id. The SSH2 protocol currently defines a stream ID of 1 to be the stderr substream.

       channel - active channel stream to read from.

       stream_id - substream ID number (e.g. 0 or SSH_EXTENDED_DATA_STDERR)

       buf - pointer to storage buffer to read data into

       buflen - size of the buf storage

       libssh2_channel_read(3) and libssh2_channel_read_stderr(3) are macros.

RETURN VALUE
       Actual number of bytes read or negative on failure. It returns LIBSSH2_ERROR_EAGAIN when it would otherwise block. While LIBSSH2_ERROR_EAGAIN is a negative number, it isn't really a  failure  per
       se.

       Note that a return value of zero (0) can in fact be a legitimate value and only signals that no payload data was read. It is not an error.

ERRORS
       LIBSSH2_ERROR_SOCKET_SEND - Unable to send data on socket.

       LIBSSH2_ERROR_CHANNEL_CLOSED - The channel has been closed.
