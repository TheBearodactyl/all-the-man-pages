strxfrm(3)                 Library Functions Manual                 strxfrm(3)

NAME
       strxfrm - string transformation

LIBRARY
       Standard C library (libc, -lc)

SYNOPSIS
       #include <string.h>

       size_t strxfrm(char dest[restrict .n], const char src[restrict .n],
                      size_t n);

DESCRIPTION
       The  strxfrm() function transforms the src string into a form such that
       the result of strcmp(3) on two strings that have been transformed  with
       strxfrm()  is  the  same as the result of strcoll(3) on the two strings
       before their transformation.  The first  n  bytes  of  the  transformed
       string  are  placed  in  dest.  The transformation is based on the pro‐
       gram's current locale for category LC_COLLATE.  (See setlocale(3)).

RETURN VALUE
       The strxfrm() function returns the number of bytes  required  to  store
       the  transformed  string  in  dest  excluding the terminating null byte
       ('\0').  If the value returned is n or more, the contents of  dest  are
       indeterminate.

PROLOG
       This  manual  page is part of the POSIX Programmer's Manual.  The Linux
       implementation of this interface may differ (consult the  corresponding
       Linux  manual page for details of Linux behavior), or the interface may
       not be implemented on Linux.

NAME
       strxfrm, strxfrm_l — string transformation

SYNOPSIS
       #include <string.h>

       size_t strxfrm(char *restrict s1, const char *restrict s2, size_t n);
       size_t strxfrm_l(char *restrict s1, const char *restrict s2,
           size_t n, locale_t locale);

DESCRIPTION
       For strxfrm(): The functionality described on this  reference  page  is
       aligned  with the ISO C standard. Any conflict between the requirements
       described here and the ISO C standard is unintentional. This volume  of
       POSIX.1‐2017 defers to the ISO C standard.

       The  strxfrm()  and  strxfrm_l()  functions  shall transform the string
       pointed to by s2 and place the resulting string into the array  pointed
       to  by  s1.   The transformation is such that if strcmp() is applied to
       two transformed strings, it shall return a value  greater  than,  equal
       to,  or  less  than 0, corresponding to the result of strcoll() or str‐
       coll_l(), respectively, applied to the same two original  strings  with
       the  same  locale.   No more than n bytes are placed into the resulting
       array pointed to by s1, including the terminating NUL character.  If  n
       is  0, s1 is permitted to be a null pointer. If copying takes place be‐
       tween objects that overlap, the behavior is undefined.

       The strxfrm() and strxfrm_l() functions shall not change the setting of
       errno if successful.

       Since  no return value is reserved to indicate an error, an application
       wishing to check for error situations should set errno to 0, then  call
       strxfrm() or strxfrm_l(), then check errno.

       The  behavior is undefined if the locale argument to strxfrm_l() is the
       special locale object LC_GLOBAL_LOCALE or is not a valid locale  object
       handle.

RETURN VALUE
       Upon  successful completion, strxfrm() and strxfrm_l() shall return the
       length of the transformed string (not  including  the  terminating  NUL
       character). If the value returned is n or more, the contents of the ar‐
       ray pointed to by s1 are unspecified.

       On error, strxfrm() and strxfrm_l() may set errno but no  return  value
       is reserved to indicate an error.

ERRORS
       These functions may fail if:

       EINVAL The  string  pointed  to  by the s2 argument contains characters
              outside the domain of the collating sequence.

       The following sections are informative.

EXAMPLES
       None.

APPLICATION USAGE
       The transformation function is such that two transformed strings can be
       ordered by strcmp() as appropriate to collating sequence information in
       the current locale (category LC_COLLATE).

       The fact that when n is 0 s1 is permitted to be a null pointer is  use‐
       ful to determine the size of the s1 array prior to making the transfor‐
       mation.

RATIONALE
       None.

FUTURE DIRECTIONS
       None.
