NAME
       CURLOPT_HTTP_VERSION - HTTP protocol version to use

SYNOPSIS
       #include <curl/curl.h>

       CURLcode curl_easy_setopt(CURL *handle, CURLOPT_HTTP_VERSION, long version);

DESCRIPTION
       Pass version a long, set to one of the values described below. They ask libcurl to use the specific HTTP versions.

       Note that the HTTP version is just a request. libcurl will still prioritize to re-use an existing connection so it might then re-use a connection using a HTTP version you have not asked for.

       CURL_HTTP_VERSION_NONE
              We do not care about what version the library uses. libcurl will use whatever it thinks fit.

       CURL_HTTP_VERSION_1_0
              Enforce HTTP 1.0 requests.

       CURL_HTTP_VERSION_1_1
              Enforce HTTP 1.1 requests.

       CURL_HTTP_VERSION_2_0
              Attempt HTTP 2 requests. libcurl will fall back to HTTP 1.1 if HTTP 2 cannot be negotiated with the server. (Added in 7.33.0)

              When  libcurl  uses  HTTP/2  over HTTPS, it does not itself insist on TLS 1.2 or higher even though that is required by the specification. A user can add this version requirement with CUR‐
              LOPT_SSLVERSION(3).

              The alias CURL_HTTP_VERSION_2 was added in 7.43.0 to better reflect the actual protocol name.

       CURL_HTTP_VERSION_2TLS
              Attempt HTTP 2 over TLS (HTTPS) only. libcurl will fall back to HTTP 1.1 if HTTP 2 cannot be negotiated with the HTTPS server. For clear text HTTP servers, libcurl will use 1.1. (Added  in
              7.47.0)

       CURL_HTTP_VERSION_2_PRIOR_KNOWLEDGE
              Issue  non-TLS HTTP requests using HTTP/2 without HTTP/1.1 Upgrade. It requires prior knowledge that the server supports HTTP/2 straight away. HTTPS requests will still do HTTP/2 the stan‐
              dard way with negotiated protocol version in the TLS handshake. (Added in 7.49.0)

       CURL_HTTP_VERSION_3
              (Added in 7.66.0) This option makes libcurl attempt to use HTTP/3 to the host given in the URL, with fallback to earlier HTTP versions if needed.

       CURL_HTTP_VERSION_3ONLY
              (Added in 7.88.0) Setting this value will make libcurl attempt to use HTTP/3 directly to server given in the URL but will not downgrade to earlier HTTP version if the server does not  sup‐
              port HTTP/3.

DEFAULT
       Since curl 7.62.0: CURL_HTTP_VERSION_2TLS

       Before that: CURL_HTTP_VERSION_1_1

PROTOCOLS
       HTTP

EXAMPLE
       CURL *curl = curl_easy_init();
       if(curl) {
         CURLcode ret;
         curl_easy_setopt(curl, CURLOPT_URL, "https://example.com/");
         curl_easy_setopt(curl, CURLOPT_HTTP_VERSION,
                          (long)CURL_HTTP_VERSION_2TLS);
         ret = curl_easy_perform(curl);
         if(ret == CURLE_HTTP_RETURNED_ERROR) {
           /* an HTTP response error problem */
         }
       }

AVAILABILITY
       Along with HTTP

RETURN VALUE
       Returns CURLE_OK if HTTP is supported, and CURLE_UNKNOWN_OPTION if not.
