REV(1)                           User Commands                          REV(1)

NAME
       rev - reverse lines characterwise

SYNOPSIS
       rev [option] [file...]

DESCRIPTION
       The rev utility copies the specified files to standard output,
       reversing the order of characters in every line. If no files are
       specified, standard input is read.

       This utility is a line-oriented tool and it uses in-memory allocated
       buffer for a whole wide-char line. If the input file is huge and
       without line breaks then allocating the memory for the file may be
       unsuccessful.

OPTIONS
       -h, --help
           Display help text and exit.

       -V, --version
           Print version and exit.
