NAME
     zip_file_extra_field_delete, zip_file_extra_field_delete_by_id â€” delete extra field for file in zip

LIBRARY
     libzip (-lzip)

SYNOPSIS
     #include <zip.h>

     int
     zip_file_extra_field_delete(zip_t *archive, zip_uint64_t index, zip_uint16_t extra_field_index, zip_flags_t flags);

     int
     zip_file_extra_field_delete_by_id(zip_t *archive, zip_uint64_t index, zip_uint16_t extra_field_id, zip_uint16_t extra_field_index, zip_flags_t flags);

DESCRIPTION
     The zip_file_extra_field_delete() function deletes the extra field with index extra_field_index for the file at position index in the zip archive.

     If extra_field_index is ZIP_EXTRA_FIELD_ALL, then all extra fields will be deleted.

     The following flags are supported:

           ZIP_FL_CENTRAL    Delete extra fields from the archive's central directory.

           ZIP_FL_LOCAL      Delete extra fields from the local file headers.

     The zip_file_extra_field_delete_by_id() function deletes the extra field with ID (two-byte signature) extra_field_id and index extra_field_index (in other words, the extra_field_index'th extra
     field with ID extra_field_id) The other arguments are the same as for zip_file_extra_field_delete() (ZIP_EXTRA_FIELD_ALL will delete all extra fields of the specified ID).

     Please note that due to the library design, the index of an extra field may be different between central directory and local file headers.  For this reason, it is not allowed to specify both
     ZIP_FL_CENTRAL and ZIP_FL_LOCAL in flags, except when deleting all extra fields (i.e., extra_field_index being ZIP_EXTRA_FIELD_ALL).

RETURN VALUES
     Upon successful completion 0 is returned.  Otherwise, -1 is returned and the error code in archive is set to indicate the error.

ERRORS
     zip_file_extra_field_delete() and zip_file_extra_field_delete_by_id() fail if:

     [ZIP_ER_NOENT]     index is not a valid file index in archive.
