NAME
       pthread_mutexattr_getpshared,  pthread_mutexattr_setpshared  -  get/set
       process-shared mutex attribute

LIBRARY
       POSIX threads library (libpthread, -lpthread)

SYNOPSIS
       #include <pthread.h>

       int pthread_mutexattr_getpshared(
                             const pthread_mutexattr_t *restrict attr,
                             int *restrict pshared);
       int pthread_mutexattr_setpshared(pthread_mutexattr_t *attr,
                             int pshared);

DESCRIPTION
       These functions get and set the process-shared attribute in a mutex at‐
       tributes  object.   This  attribute must be appropriately set to ensure
       correct, efficient operation of a mutex created using  this  attributes
       object.

       The process-shared attribute can have one of the following values:

       PTHREAD_PROCESS_PRIVATE
              Mutexes  created  with  this  attributes object are to be shared
              only among threads in the same process that initialized the  mu‐
              tex.  This is the default value for the process-shared mutex at‐
              tribute.

       PTHREAD_PROCESS_SHARED
              Mutexes created with this attributes object can  be  shared  be‐
              tween  any threads that have access to the memory containing the
              object, including threads in different processes.

       pthread_mutexattr_getpshared() places the value of  the  process-shared
       attribute of the mutex attributes object referred to by attr in the lo‐
       cation pointed to by pshared.

       pthread_mutexattr_setpshared() sets the value of the process-shared at‐
       tribute of the mutex attributes object referred to by attr to the value
       specified in pshared.

       If attr does not refer to an initialized mutex attributes  object,  the
       behavior is undefined.

RETURN VALUE
       On success, these functions return 0.  On error, they return a positive
       error number.

ERRORS
       pthread_mutexattr_setpshared() can fail with the following errors:

       EINVAL The value specified in pshared is invalid.

       ENOTSUP
              pshared is PTHREAD_PROCESS_SHARED but  the  implementation  does
              not support process-shared mutexes.

PROLOG
       This  manual  page is part of the POSIX Programmer's Manual.  The Linux
       implementation of this interface may differ (consult the  corresponding

NAME
       pthread_mutexattr_getpshared, pthread_mutexattr_setpshared  —  get  and
       set the process-shared attribute

SYNOPSIS
       #include <pthread.h>

       int pthread_mutexattr_getpshared(const pthread_mutexattr_t
           *restrict attr, int *restrict pshared);
       int pthread_mutexattr_setpshared(pthread_mutexattr_t *attr,
           int pshared);

DESCRIPTION
       The  pthread_mutexattr_getpshared()  function shall obtain the value of
       the process-shared attribute from the attributes object  referenced  by
       attr.

       The  pthread_mutexattr_setpshared()  function  shall  set  the process-
       shared attribute in an  initialized  attributes  object  referenced  by
       attr.

       The process-shared attribute is set to PTHREAD_PROCESS_SHARED to permit
       a mutex to be operated upon by any thread that has access to the memory
       where  the mutex is allocated, even if the mutex is allocated in memory
       that is shared by multiple processes. See Section  2.9.9,  Synchroniza‐
       tion  Object  Copies and Alternative Mappings for further requirements.
       The default value of the attribute shall be PTHREAD_PROCESS_PRIVATE.

       The behavior is undefined if the value specified by the  attr  argument
       to   pthread_mutexattr_getpshared()  or  pthread_mutexattr_setpshared()
       does not refer to an initialized mutex attributes object.

RETURN VALUE
       Upon successful completion, pthread_mutexattr_setpshared() shall return
       zero;  otherwise, an error number shall be returned to indicate the er‐
       ror.

       Upon successful completion, pthread_mutexattr_getpshared() shall return
       zero  and  store the value of the process-shared attribute of attr into
       the object referenced by the pshared  parameter.  Otherwise,  an  error
       number shall be returned to indicate the error.

ERRORS
       The pthread_mutexattr_setpshared() function may fail if:

       EINVAL The  new  value specified for the attribute is outside the range
              of legal values for that attribute.

       These functions shall not return an error code of [EINTR].

       The following sections are informative.

EXAMPLES
       None.

APPLICATION USAGE
       None.

RATIONALE
       If an implementation detects that the value specified by the attr argu‐
       ment   to   pthread_mutexattr_getpshared()  or  pthread_mutexattr_setp‐
       shared() does not refer to an initialized mutex attributes  object,  it
       is recommended that the function should fail and report an [EINVAL] er‐
       ror.

FUTURE DIRECTIONS
       None.
