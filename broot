NAME
       broot - Tree view, file manager, configurable launcher

SYNOPSIS
       broot [flags] [options] [path]
       br [flags] [options] [path]

DESCRIPTION
       broot lets you explore file hierarchies with a tree-like view, manipulate files, launch actions, and define your own shortcuts.

       broot is best launched as br: this shell function gives you access to more commands, especially cd. The br shell function is interactively installed on first broot launch.

       Flags  and options can be classically passed on launch but also written in the configuration file. Each flag has a counter-flag so that you can cancel at command line a flag which has been set in
       the configuration file.

FLAGS
       FLAGS

       -d ,  --dates
              Show the last modified date of files and directories

       -D ,  --no-dates
              Don't show the last modified date

       -f ,  --only-folders
              Only show folders

       -F ,  --no-only-folders
              Show folders and files alike

       -g ,  --show-git-info
              Show git statuses on files and stats of repository

       -G ,  --no-show-git-info
              Don't show git statuses on files nor stats

       -h ,  --hidden
              Show hidden files

       -H ,  --no-hidden
              Don't show hidden files

       -i ,  --show-gitignored
              Show files which should be ignored according to git

       -I ,  --no-show-gitignored
              Don't show gitignored files

       -p ,  --permissions
              Show permissions with owner and group

       -P ,  --no-permissions
              Don't show permissions

       -s ,  --sizes
              Show the sizes of files and directories. When this mode is on, children aren't shown so that the biggest entries at the selected level can be sorted first.

       -S ,  --no-sizes
              Don't show sizes

       -t ,  --trim-root
              Trim the root: remove elements which would exceed the screen size. This removes the scrollbar.

       -T ,  --no-trim-root
              Don't trim the root (still trim the deeper levels). A scrollbar may be used when there are too many elements to show on screen.

       --install
              Install or reinstall the br shell function

       --color <yes|no|auto>
              Controls styling of the output (default: auto). If set to auto, all styling is removed when output is piped.

       --help Prints a help page, with more or less the same content as this man page

       -v ,  --version
              Prints the version of broot

PARAMETERS:
       --outcmd <cmd-export-path>
              Where to write a command if broot produces one

       -c ,  --cmd <commands>
              Semicolon separated commands to execute on start of broot

       --height <height>
              Height to use if you don't want to fill the screen or for file export (by default the terminal height is used)

       -o ,  --out <file-export-path>
              Where to write the produced path, if any

       --set-install-state <undefined|refused|installed>
              Set the installation state. This is mostly useful in installation scripts to override the normal installation process.

       --print-shell-function <bash|fish|zsh>
              Print to stdout the br function for the given shell. This can be used in your own installation process overridden the standard one.

BUGS
       broot is known to be slow on most Windows installations.

       On unix and mac platforms, most problems you may encounter are related to some terminals or terminal multiplexers which either intercepts some standard TTY instructions or break buffering or size
       querying. The list of shortcuts you can define in the config file is thus dependent of your system.
