NAME
       TAP::Parser::Scheduler::Spinner - A no-op job.

VERSION
       Version 3.44

SYNOPSIS
           use TAP::Parser::Scheduler::Spinner;

DESCRIPTION
       A no-op job. Returned by "TAP::Parser::Scheduler" as an instruction to the harness to spin (keep executing tests) while the scheduler can't return a real job.

METHODS
   Class Methods
       "new"

           my $job = TAP::Parser::Scheduler::Spinner->new;

       Ignores any arguments and returns a new "TAP::Parser::Scheduler::Spinner" object.

   Instance Methods
       "is_spinner"

       Returns true indicating that is a 'spinner' job. Spinners are returned when the scheduler still has pending jobs but can't (because of locking) return one right now.
