NAME
       gnutls_hmac_fast - API function

SYNOPSIS
       #include <gnutls/crypto.h>

       int gnutls_hmac_fast(gnutls_mac_algorithm_t algorithm, const void * key, size_t keylen, const void * ptext, size_t ptext_len, void * digest);

ARGUMENTS
       gnutls_mac_algorithm_t algorithm
                   the hash algorithm to use

       const void * key
                   the key to use

       size_t keylen
                   the length of the key

       const void * ptext
                   the data to hash

       size_t ptext_len
                   the length of data to hash

       void * digest
                   is the output value of the hash

DESCRIPTION
       This convenience function will hash the given data and return output on a single call. Note, this call will not work for MAC algorithms that require nonce (like UMAC or GMAC).

RETURNS
       Zero or a negative error code on error.

SINCE
       2.10.0
