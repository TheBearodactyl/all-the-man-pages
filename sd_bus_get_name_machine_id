NAME
       sd_bus_get_name_machine_id - Retrieve a bus client's machine identity

SYNOPSIS
       #include <systemd/sd-bus.h>

       int sd_bus_get_name_machine_id(sd_bus *bus, const char *name,
                                      sd_id128_t *machine);

DESCRIPTION
       sd_bus_get_name_machine_id() retrieves the D-Bus machine identity of
       the machine that the bus client identified by name is running on.
       Internally, it calls the GetMachineId method of the
       org.freedesktop.DBus.Peer interface. The D-Bus machine identity is a
       128-bit UUID. On Linux systems running systemd, this corresponds to the
       contents of /etc/machine-id. On success, the machine identity is stored
       in machine.

RETURN VALUE
       On success, this function returns a non-negative integer. On failure,
       it returns a negative errno-style error code.

   Errors
       Returned errors may indicate the following problems:

       -EINVAL
           An argument is invalid.

       -ENOPKG
           The bus cannot be resolved.

       -ECHILD
           The bus was created in a different process.

       -ENOMEM
           Memory allocation failed.

NOTES
       These APIs are implemented as a shared library, which can be compiled
       and linked to with the libsystemd pkg-config(1) file.
