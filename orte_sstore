NAME
       Open  RTE  MCA  File  Management  (SStore) Framework - Overview of Open
       RTE's SStore framework, and selected modules.  Open MPI 4.1.5

DESCRIPTION
       SStore is a utility framework used by OpenRTE for  a  variety  of  pur‐
       poses, including the transport of checkpoint files, preloading user bi‐
       naries, and preloading of user files.

AVAILABLE COMPONENTS
       The following MCA parameters apply to all components:

       sstore_base_verbose
           Set the verbosity level for all components. Default is 0, or silent
           except on error.

   central SStore Component
       The  central  component  implements  a fully centralized stable storage
       mechanism that requires a shared storage medium (e.g., NFS).

       The central component has the following MCA parameters:

       sstore_central_priority
           The component's priority to use when selecting the most appropriate
           component for a run.

       sstore_central_verbose
           Set the verbosity level for this component. Default is 0, or silent
           except on error.
