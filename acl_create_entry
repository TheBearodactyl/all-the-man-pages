NAME
     acl_create_entry — create a new ACL entry

LIBRARY
     Linux Access Control Lists library (libacl, -lacl).

SYNOPSIS
     #include <sys/types.h>
     #include <sys/acl.h>

     int
     acl_create_entry(acl_t *acl_p, acl_entry_t *entry_p);

DESCRIPTION
     The acl_create_entry() function creates a new ACL entry in the ACL pointed to by the contents of the pointer argument acl_p.  On success, the function returns a descriptor for the new ACL entry via
     entry_p.

     This function may cause memory to be allocated.  The caller should free any releasable memory, when the new ACL is no longer required, by calling acl_free(3) with (void*)*acl_p as an argument.  If
     the ACL working storage cannot be increased in the current location, then the working storage for the ACL pointed to by acl_p may be relocated and the previous working storage is released. A
     pointer to the new working storage is returned via acl_p.

     The components of the new ACL entry are initialized in the following ways: the ACL tag type component contains ACL_UNDEFINED_TAG, the qualifier component contains ACL_UNDEFINED_ID, and the set of
     permissions has no permissions enabled. Any existing ACL entry descriptors that refer to entries in the ACL continue to refer to those entries.

RETURN VALUE
     The acl_create_entry() function returns the value 0 if successful; otherwise the value -1 is returned and the global variable errno is set to indicate the error.

ERRORS
     If any of the following conditions occur, the acl_create_entry() function returns -1 and sets errno to the corresponding value:

     [EINVAL]           The argument acl_p is not a valid pointer to an ACL.

     [ENOMEM]           The ACL working storage requires more memory than is allowed by the hardware or system-imposed memory management constraints.

STANDARDS
     IEEE Std 1003.1e draft 17 (“POSIX.1e”, abandoned)
