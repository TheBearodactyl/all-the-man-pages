NAME
       XPropertyEvent - PropertyNotify event structure

STRUCTURES
       The structure for PropertyNotify events contains:

       typedef struct {
               int type;       /* PropertyNotify */
               unsigned long serial;   /* # of last request processed by server */
               Bool send_event;        /* true if this came from a SendEvent request */
               Display *display;       /* Display the event was read from */
               Window window;
               Atom atom;
               Time time;
               int state;      /* PropertyNewValue or PropertyDelete */
       } XPropertyEvent;

       When you receive this event, the structure members are set as follows.

       The  type  member is set to the event type constant name that uniquely identifies it.  For example, when the X server reports a GraphicsExpose event to a client application, it sends an XGraphic‐
       sExposeEvent structure with the type member set to GraphicsExpose.  The display member is set to a pointer to the display the event was read on.  The send_event member is set to True if the event
       came  from a SendEvent protocol request.  The serial member is set from the serial number reported in the protocol but expanded from the 16-bit least-significant bits to a full 32-bit value.  The
       window member is set to the window that is most useful to toolkit dispatchers.

       The window member is set to the window whose associated property was changed.  The atom member is set to the property's atom and indicates which property was changed or desired.  The time  member
       is  set  to the server time when the property was changed.  The state member is set to indicate whether the property was changed to a new value or deleted and can be PropertyNewValue or Property‐
       Delete.  The state member is set to PropertyNewValue when a property of the window is changed using XChangeProperty or XRotateWindowProperties (even when adding zero-length  data  using  XChange‐
       Property) and when replacing all or part of a property with identical data using XChangeProperty or XRotateWindowProperties.  The state member is set to PropertyDelete when a property of the win‐
       dow is deleted using XDeleteProperty or, if the delete argument is True, XGetWindowProperty.
