NAME
       gnutls_sign_algorithm_get_requested - API function

SYNOPSIS
       #include <gnutls/gnutls.h>

       int gnutls_sign_algorithm_get_requested(gnutls_session_t session, size_t indx, gnutls_sign_algorithm_t * algo);

ARGUMENTS
       gnutls_session_t session
                   is a gnutls_session_t type.

       size_t indx is an index of the signature algorithm to return

       gnutls_sign_algorithm_t * algo
                   the returned certificate type will be stored there

DESCRIPTION
       Returns  the  signature  algorithm specified by index that was requested by the peer. If the specified index has no data available this function returns GNUTLS_E_REQUESTED_DATA_NOT_AVAILABLE.  If
       the negotiated TLS version does not support signature algorithms then GNUTLS_E_REQUESTED_DATA_NOT_AVAILABLE will be returned even for the first index.  The first index is 0.

       This function is useful in the certificate callback functions to assist in selecting the correct certificate.

RETURNS
       On success, GNUTLS_E_SUCCESS (0) is returned, otherwise an error code is returned.

SINCE
       2.10.0
