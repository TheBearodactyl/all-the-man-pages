NAME
       gnutls_global_init - API function

SYNOPSIS
       #include <gnutls/gnutls.h>

       int gnutls_global_init( void);

ARGUMENTS
        void

DESCRIPTION
       Since  GnuTLS  3.3.0  this  function  is  no  longer  necessary  to  be  explicitly  called.  To disable the implicit call (in a library constructor) of this function set the environment variable
       GNUTLS_NO_IMPLICIT_INIT to 1.

       This function performs any required precalculations, detects the supported CPU capabilities and initializes the underlying cryptographic backend. In order to free any resources taken by this call
       you should gnutls_global_deinit() when gnutls usage is no longer needed.

       This  function  increments  a  global counter, so that gnutls_global_deinit() only releases resources when it has been called as many times as gnutls_global_init().  This is useful when GnuTLS is
       used by more than one library in an application.  This function can be called many times, but will only do something the first time. It is thread safe since GnuTLS 3.3.0.

       A subsequent call of this function if the initial has failed will return the same error code.

RETURNS
       On success, GNUTLS_E_SUCCESS (0) is returned, otherwise a negative error code is returned.
