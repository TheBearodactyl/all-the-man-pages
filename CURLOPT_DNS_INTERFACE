NAME
       CURLOPT_DNS_INTERFACE - interface to speak DNS over

SYNOPSIS
       #include <curl/curl.h>

       CURLcode curl_easy_setopt(CURL *handle, CURLOPT_DNS_INTERFACE, char *ifname);

DESCRIPTION
       Pass a char * as parameter. Set the name of the network interface that the DNS resolver should bind to. This must be an interface name (not an address). Set this option to NULL to use the default
       setting (do not bind to a specific interface).

       The application does not have to keep the string around after setting this option.

DEFAULT
       NULL

PROTOCOLS
       All protocols except file:// - protocols that resolve host names.

EXAMPLE
       CURL *curl = curl_easy_init();
       if(curl) {
         curl_easy_setopt(curl, CURLOPT_URL, "https://example.com/foo.bin");
         curl_easy_setopt(curl, CURLOPT_DNS_INTERFACE, "eth0");
         ret = curl_easy_perform(curl);
         curl_easy_cleanup(curl);
       }

AVAILABILITY
       Added in 7.33.0. This option also requires that libcurl was built with a resolver backend that supports this operation. The c-ares backend is the only such one.

RETURN VALUE
       Returns CURLE_OK if the option is supported, CURLE_UNKNOWN_OPTION if not, or CURLE_NOT_BUILT_IN if support was disabled at compile-time.
