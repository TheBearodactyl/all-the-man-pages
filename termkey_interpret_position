NAME
       termkey_interpret_position - interpret opaque cursor position event data

SYNOPSIS
       #include <termkey.h>

       TermKeyResult termkey_interpret_position(TermKey *tk, const TermKeyKey *key,
           int *line, int *col);

       Link with -ltermkey.

DESCRIPTION
       termkey_interpret_position()  fills  in  variables  in the passed pointers according to the cursor position report event found in key. It should be called if termkey_getkey(3) or similar have re‚Äê
       turned a key event with the type of TERMKEY_TYPE_POSITION.

       Any pointer may instead be given as NULL to not return that value.

       The line and col variables will be filled in with the cursor position, indexed from 1. Note that due to the limited number of bytes in the TermKeyKey structure, the line and  column  numbers  are
       limited to 2047 and 4095 respectively.

RETURN VALUE
       If passed a key event of the type TERMKEY_TYPE_POSITION, this function will return TERMKEY_RES_KEY and will affect the variables whose pointers were passed in, as described above.

       For other event types it will return TERMKEY_RES_NONE, and its effects on any variables whose pointers were passed in, are undefined.
