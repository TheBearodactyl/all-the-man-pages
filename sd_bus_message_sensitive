NAME
       sd_bus_message_sensitive - Mark a message object as containing
       sensitive data

SYNOPSIS
       #include <systemd/sd-bus.h>

       int sd_bus_message_sensitive(sd_bus_message *message);

DESCRIPTION
       sd_bus_message_sensitive() marks an allocated bus message as containing
       sensitive data. This ensures that the message data is carefully removed
       from memory (specifically, overwritten with zero bytes) when released.
       It is recommended to mark all incoming and outgoing messages like this
       that contain security credentials and similar data that should be dealt
       with carefully. Note that it is not possible to unmark messages like
       this, it's a one way operation. If a message is already marked
       sensitive and then marked sensitive a second time the message remains
       marked so and no further operation is executed.

       As a safety precaution all messages that are created as reply to
       messages that are marked sensitive are also implicitly marked so.

RETURN VALUE
       On success, this functions return 0 or a positive integer. On failure,
       it returns a negative errno-style error code.

   Errors
       Returned errors may indicate the following problems:

       -EINVAL
           The message parameter is NULL.

NOTES
       These APIs are implemented as a shared library, which can be compiled
       and linked to with the libsystemd pkg-config(1) file.
