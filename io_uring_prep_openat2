       void io_uring_prep_openat2_direct(struct io_uring_sqe *sqe,
                                         int dfd,
                                         const char *path,
                                         int flags,
                                         struct open_how *how,
                                         unsigned file_index);

DESCRIPTION
       The  io_uring_prep_openat2(3)  function prepares an openat2 request. The submission queue entry sqe is setup to use the directory file descriptor dfd to start opening a file described by path and
       using the open flags in flags and using the instructions on how to open the file given in how.

       For a direct descriptor open request, the offset is specified by the file_index argument. Direct descriptors are io_uring private file descriptors. They avoid some of the overhead associated with
       thread  shared  file  tables, and can be used in any io_uring request that takes a file descriptor. To do so, IOSQE_FIXED_FILE must be set in the SQE flags member, and the SQE fd field should use
       the direct descriptor value rather than the regular file descriptor. Direct descriptors are managed like registered files.

       If the direct variant is used, the application must first have registered a file table using io_uring_register_files(3) of the appropriate size. Once registered, a direct accept request  may  use
       any  entry  in  that table, as long as it is within the size of the registered table.  If a specified entry already contains a file, the file will first be removed from the table and closed. It's
       consistent with the behavior of updating an existing file with io_uring_register_files_update(3).  Note that old kernels don't check the SQE file_index field, which is not a problem for  liburing
       helpers,  but users of the raw io_uring interface need to zero SQEs to avoid unexpected behavior.  If IORING_FILE_INDEX_ALLOC is used as the file_index for a direct open, then io_uring will allo‐
       cate a free direct descriptor in the existing table. The allocated descriptor is returned in the CQE res field just like it would be for a non-direct open request. If no more entries  are  avail‐
       able in the direct descriptor table, -ENFILE is returned instead.

       These functions prepare an async openat2(2) request. See that man page for details.

RETURN VALUE
       None

ERRORS
       The CQE res field will contain the result of the operation. See the related man page for details on possible values. Note that where synchronous system calls will return -1 on failure and set er‐
       rno to the actual error value, io_uring never uses errno.  Instead it returns the negated errno directly in the CQE res field.

NOTES
       As with any request that passes in data in a struct, that data must remain valid until the request has been successfully submitted. It need not remain valid until completion. Once a  request  has
       been  submitted, the in-kernel state is stable. Very early kernels (5.4 and earlier) required state to be stable until the completion occurred. Applications can test for this behavior by inspect‐
       ing the IORING_FEAT_SUBMIT_STABLE flag passed back from io_uring_queue_init_params(3).
