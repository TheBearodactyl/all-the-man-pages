NAME
       chsh - change your login shell

SYNOPSIS
       chsh [-s shell] [-l] [-h] [-v] [username]

DESCRIPTION
       chsh is used to change your login shell. If a shell is not given on the command line, chsh prompts for one.

       chsh supports non-local entries (kerberos, LDAP, etc.) if linked with libuser, otherwise use ypchsh(1), lchsh(1) or any other implementation for non-local entries.

OPTIONS
       -s, --shell shell
           Specify your login shell.

       -l, --list-shells
           Print the list of shells listed in /etc/shells and exit.

       -h, --help
           Display help text and exit.

       -V, --version
           Print version and exit.

VALID SHELLS
       chsh will accept the full pathname of any executable file on the system.

       The default behavior for non-root users is to accept only shells listed in the /etc/shells file, and issue a warning for root user. It can also be configured at compile-time to only issue a
       warning for all users.

EXIT STATUS
       Returns 0 if operation was successful, 1 if operation failed or command syntax was not valid.
