NAME
       dane_verify_crt - API function

SYNOPSIS
       #include <gnutls/dane.h>

       int dane_verify_crt(dane_state_t s, const gnutls_datum_t * chain, unsigned chain_size, gnutls_certificate_type_t chain_type, const char * hostname, const char * proto, unsigned int port, unsigned
       int sflags, unsigned int vflags, unsigned int * verify);

ARGUMENTS
       dane_state_t s
                   A DANE state structure (may be NULL)

       const gnutls_datum_t * chain
                   A certificate chain

       unsigned chain_size
                   The size of the chain

       gnutls_certificate_type_t chain_type
                   The type of the certificate chain

       const char * hostname
                   The hostname associated with the chain

       const char * proto
                   The protocol of the service connecting (e.g. tcp)

       unsigned int port
                   The port of the service connecting (e.g. 443)

       unsigned int sflags
                   Flags for the initialization of  s (if NULL)

       unsigned int vflags
                   Verification flags; an OR'ed list of dane_verify_flags_t.

       unsigned int * verify
                   An OR'ed list of dane_verify_status_t.

DESCRIPTION
       This function will verify the given certificate chain against the CA constrains and/or the certificate available via DANE.  If  no  information  via  DANE  can  be  obtained  the  flag  DANE_VER‐
       IFY_NO_DANE_INFO is set. If a DNSSEC signature is not available for the DANE record then the verify flag DANE_VERIFY_NO_DNSSEC_DATA is set.

       Due to the many possible options of DANE, there is no single threat model countered. When notifying the user about DANE verification results it may be better to mention: DANE verification did not
       reject the certificate, rather than mentioning a successful DANE verification.

       Note that this function is designed to be run in addition to PKIX - certificate chain - verification. To be run independently the DANE_VFLAG_ONLY_CHECK_EE_USAGE flag should be specified; then the
       function will check whether the key of the peer matches the key advertized in the DANE entry.

RETURNS
       a  negative  error code on error and DANE_E_SUCCESS (0) when the DANE entries were successfully parsed, irrespective of whether they were verified (see  verify for that information). If no usable
       entries were encountered DANE_E_REQUESTED_DATA_NOT_AVAILABLE will be returned.
