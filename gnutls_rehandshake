NAME
       gnutls_rehandshake - API function

SYNOPSIS
       #include <gnutls/gnutls.h>

       int gnutls_rehandshake(gnutls_session_t session);

ARGUMENTS
       gnutls_session_t session
                   is a gnutls_session_t type.

DESCRIPTION
       This function can only be called in server side, and instructs a TLS 1.2 or earlier client to renegotiate parameters (perform a handshake), by sending a hello request message.

       If this function succeeds, the calling application should call gnutls_record_recv() until GNUTLS_E_REHANDSHAKE is returned to clear any pending data. If the GNUTLS_E_REHANDSHAKE error code is not
       seen, then the handshake request was not followed by the peer (the TLS protocol does not require the client to do, and such compliance should be handled by the application protocol).

       Once the GNUTLS_E_REHANDSHAKE error code is seen, the calling application should proceed to calling gnutls_handshake() to negotiate the new parameters.

       If the client does not wish to renegotiate parameters he may reply with an alert message, and in that case  the  return  code  seen  by  subsequent  gnutls_record_recv()  will  be  GNUTLS_E_WARN‐
       ING_ALERT_RECEIVED with the specific alert being GNUTLS_A_NO_RENEGOTIATION.  A client may also choose to ignore this request.

       Under  TLS 1.3 this function is equivalent to gnutls_session_key_update() with the GNUTLS_KU_PEER flag. In that case subsequent calls to gnutls_record_recv() will not return GNUTLS_E_REHANDSHAKE,
       and calls to gnutls_handshake() in server side are a no-op.

       This function always fails with GNUTLS_E_INVALID_REQUEST when called in client side.

RETURNS
       GNUTLS_E_SUCCESS on success, otherwise a negative error code.
