NAME
       paccheck - check installed packages

SYNOPSIS
        paccheck [options] [<package>]...
        paccheck (--help|--version)

DESCRIPTION
       Check installed packages.  Additional packages may be specified on
       stdin.  If no package are provided, all installed packages will be
       checked.  By default only package dependencies and basic file
       information will checked.

OPTIONS
       --config=path
           Set an alternate configuration file path.

       --dbpath=path
           Set an alternate database path.

       --root=path
           Set an alternate installation root.

       --sysroot=path
           Set an alternate system root.  See pacutils-sysroot(7).

       --null[=sep]
           Set an alternate separator for values parsed from stdin.  By
           default a newline "\n" is used as the separator.  If --null is used
           without specifying sep "NUL" will be used.

       --list-broken
           Only print the names of packages that fail the selected checks.

       --quiet
           Only display messages if a problem is found.

       --recursive
           Recursively perform checks on packages' dependencies as well.

       --depends
           Check that all package dependencies are satisfied.

       --opt-depends
           Check that all package optional dependencies are satisfied.

       --files
           Check package files against the local database.

       --file-properties
           Check package files against MTREE data.

       --md5sum
           Check file md5sums against MTREE data.

       --sha256sum
           Check file sha256sums against MTREE data.

       --require-mtree
           Treat missing MTREE data as an error for --db-files and/or
           --file-properties.

       --db-files
           Include database files in --files and --file-properties checks.
           --files will test for the existence of desc, files, and mtree (with
           --require-mtree) files in the package database entry.
           --file-properties will check install and changelog files in the
           package database where applicable.

       --backup
           Include backup files in file modification checks.

       --noextract
           Include NoExtract files in file modification checks.

       --noupgrade
           Include NoUpgrade files in file modification checks.

       --help
           Display usage information and exit.

       --version
           Display version information and exit.

CAVEATS
       paccheck determines whether or not to read packages from stdin based on
       a naive check using isatty(3).  If paccheck is called in an
       environment, such as a shell function or script being used in a pipe,
       where stdin is not connected to a terminal but does not contain
       packages to check, paccheck should be called with stdin closed.  For
       POSIX-compatible shells, this can be done with "<&-".
