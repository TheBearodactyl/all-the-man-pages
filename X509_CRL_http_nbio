X509_LOAD_HTTP(3ssl)                                                                              OpenSSL                                                                             X509_LOAD_HTTP(3ssl)

NAME
       X509_load_http, X509_http_nbio, X509_CRL_load_http, X509_CRL_http_nbio - certificate and CRL loading functions

SYNOPSIS
        #include <openssl/x509.h>

        X509 *X509_load_http(const char *url, BIO *bio, BIO *rbio, int timeout);
        X509_CRL *X509_CRL_load_http(const char *url, BIO *bio, BIO *rbio, int timeout);

       The following macros have been deprecated since OpenSSL 3.0, and can be hidden entirely by defining OPENSSL_API_COMPAT with a suitable version value, see openssl_user_macros(7):

        #define X509_http_nbio(rctx, pcert)
        #define X509_CRL_http_nbio(rctx, pcrl)

DESCRIPTION
       X509_load_http() and X509_CRL_load_http() loads a certificate or a CRL, respectively, in ASN.1 format using HTTP from the given url.

       If bio is given and rbio is NULL then this BIO is used instead of an internal one for connecting, writing the request, and reading the response.  If both bio and rbio are given (which may be
       memory BIOs, for instance) then no explicit connection is attempted, bio is used for writing the request, and rbio for reading the response.

       If the timeout parameter is > 0 this indicates the maximum number of seconds to wait until the transfer is complete.  A value of 0 enables waiting indefinitely, while a value < 0 immediately
       leads to a timeout condition.

       X509_http_nbio() and X509_CRL_http_nbio() are macros for backward compatibility that have the same effect as the functions above but with infinite timeout and without the possibility to specify
       custom BIOs.

RETURN VALUES
       On success the function yield the loaded value, else NULL.  Error conditions include connection/transfer timeout, parse errors, etc.

HISTORY
       X509_load_http() and X509_CRL_load_http() were added in OpenSSL 3.0.  X509_http_nbio() and X509_CRL_http_nbio() were deprecated in OpenSSL 3.0.
