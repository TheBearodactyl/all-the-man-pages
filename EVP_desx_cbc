NAME
       EVP_desx_cbc - EVP DES-X cipher

SYNOPSIS
        #include <openssl/evp.h>

        const EVP_CIPHER *EVP_desx_cbc(void);

DESCRIPTION
       The DES-X encryption algorithm for EVP.

       All modes below use a key length of 128 bits and acts on blocks of 128-bits.

       EVP_desx_cbc()
           The DES-X algorithm in CBC mode.

           This algorithm is not provided by the OpenSSL default provider.  To use it is necessary to load either the OpenSSL legacy provider or another implementation.

RETURN VALUES
       These functions return an EVP_CIPHER structure that contains the implementation of the symmetric cipher. See EVP_CIPHER_meth_new(3) for details of the EVP_CIPHER structure.
