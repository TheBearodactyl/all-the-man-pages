NAME
       PCRE2 - Perl-compatible regular expressions (revised API)

SYNOPSIS

       #include <pcre2.h>

       int pcre2_substring_list_get(pcre2_match_data *match_data,
         PCRE2_UCHAR ***listptr, PCRE2_SIZE **lengthsptr);

DESCRIPTION

       This  is  a  convenience  function for extracting all the captured sub‐
       strings after a pattern match. It builds a  list  of  pointers  to  the
       strings, and (optionally) a second list that contains their lengths (in
       code units), excluding a terminating zero that  is  added  to  each  of
       them. All this is done in a single block of memory that is obtained us‐
       ing the same memory allocation function that was used to get the  match
       data block. The convenience function pcre2_substring_list_free() can be
       used to free it when it is no longer needed. The arguments are:

         match_data    The match data block
         listptr       Where to put a pointer to the list
         lengthsptr    Where to put a pointer to the lengths, or NULL

       A pointer to a list of pointers is put in the variable whose address is
       in  listptr. The list is terminated by a NULL pointer. If lengthsptr is
       not NULL, a matching list of lengths is created,  and  its  address  is
       placed  in  lengthsptr. The yield of the function is zero on success or
       PCRE2_ERROR_NOMEMORY if sufficient memory could not be obtained.

       There is a complete description of the PCRE2 native API in the pcre2api
       page and a description of the POSIX API in the pcre2posix page.
