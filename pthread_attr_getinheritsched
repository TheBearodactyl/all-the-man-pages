NAME
       pthread_attr_setinheritsched,  pthread_attr_getinheritsched  -  set/get
       inherit-scheduler attribute in thread attributes object

LIBRARY
       POSIX threads library (libpthread, -lpthread)

SYNOPSIS
       #include <pthread.h>

       int pthread_attr_setinheritsched(pthread_attr_t *attr,
                                        int inheritsched);
       int pthread_attr_getinheritsched(const pthread_attr_t *restrict attr,
                                        int *restrict inheritsched);

DESCRIPTION
       The pthread_attr_setinheritsched() function sets the  inherit-scheduler
       attribute  of  the  thread attributes object referred to by attr to the
       value specified in inheritsched.  The inherit-scheduler  attribute  de‐
       termines  whether  a  thread created using the thread attributes object
       attr will inherit its scheduling attributes from the calling thread  or
       whether it will take them from attr.

       The  following scheduling attributes are affected by the inherit-sched‐
       uler  attribute:  scheduling  policy  (pthread_attr_setschedpolicy(3)),
       scheduling  priority  (pthread_attr_setschedparam(3)),  and  contention
       scope (pthread_attr_setscope(3)).

       The following values may be specified in inheritsched:

       PTHREAD_INHERIT_SCHED
              Threads that are  created  using  attr  inherit  scheduling  at‐
              tributes  from the creating thread; the scheduling attributes in
              attr are ignored.

       PTHREAD_EXPLICIT_SCHED
              Threads that are created using attr take  their  scheduling  at‐
              tributes from the values specified by the attributes object.

       The  default setting of the inherit-scheduler attribute in a newly ini‐
       tialized thread attributes object is PTHREAD_INHERIT_SCHED.

       The pthread_attr_getinheritsched() returns the inherit-scheduler attri‐
       bute  of  the thread attributes object attr in the buffer pointed to by
       inheritsched.

RETURN VALUE
       On success, these functions return 0; on error, they return  a  nonzero
       error number.

ERRORS
       pthread_attr_setinheritsched() can fail with the following error:

       EINVAL Invalid value in inheritsched.

       POSIX.1  also documents an optional ENOTSUP error ("attempt was made to
       set the attribute to an unsupported value") for  pthread_attr_setinher‐
       itsched().

HISTORY
       glibc 2.0.  POSIX.1-2001.

BUGS
       As  at  glibc  2.8,  if a thread attributes object is initialized using
       pthread_attr_init(3), then the scheduling policy of the attributes  ob‐
       ject  is  set  to  SCHED_OTHER and the scheduling priority is set to 0.
       However, if the inherit-scheduler attribute is then set to  PTHREAD_EX‐
       PLICIT_SCHED,  then a thread created using the attribute object wrongly
       inherits its scheduling attributes from the creating thread.  This  bug
       does  not  occur if either the scheduling policy or scheduling priority
       attribute is explicitly set in  the  thread  attributes  object  before
       calling pthread_create(3).

EXAMPLES
       See pthread_setschedparam(3).

       This  manual  page is part of the POSIX Programmer's Manual.  The Linux
       implementation of this interface may differ (consult the  corresponding
       Linux  manual page for details of Linux behavior), or the interface may

NAME
       pthread_attr_getinheritsched, pthread_attr_setinheritsched  —  get  and
       set the inheritsched attribute (REALTIME THREADS)

SYNOPSIS
       #include <pthread.h>

       int pthread_attr_getinheritsched(const pthread_attr_t *restrict attr,
           int *restrict inheritsched);
       int pthread_attr_setinheritsched(pthread_attr_t *attr,
           int inheritsched);

DESCRIPTION
       The  pthread_attr_getinheritsched()  and pthread_attr_setinheritsched()
       functions, respectively, shall get and set the  inheritsched  attribute
       in the attr argument.

       When  the  attributes  objects are used by pthread_create(), the inher‐
       itsched attribute determines how the other scheduling attributes of the
       created thread shall be set.

       The supported values of inheritsched shall be:

       PTHREAD_INHERIT_SCHED
             Specifies  that  the thread scheduling attributes shall be inher‐
             ited from the creating thread, and the scheduling  attributes  in
             this attr argument shall be ignored.

       PTHREAD_EXPLICIT_SCHED
             Specifies  that  the thread scheduling attributes shall be set to
             the corresponding values from this attributes object.

       The symbols PTHREAD_INHERIT_SCHED and  PTHREAD_EXPLICIT_SCHED  are  de‐
       fined in the <pthread.h> header.

       The  following thread scheduling attributes defined by POSIX.1‐2008 are
       affected by the inheritsched attribute:  scheduling  policy  (schedpol‐
       icy),  scheduling  parameters  (schedparam),  and scheduling contention
       scope (contentionscope).

       The behavior is undefined if the value specified by the  attr  argument
       to   pthread_attr_getinheritsched()  or  pthread_attr_setinheritsched()
       does not refer to an initialized thread attributes object.

RETURN VALUE
       If successful, the pthread_attr_getinheritsched() and pthread_attr_set‐
       inheritsched()  functions shall return zero; otherwise, an error number
       shall be returned to indicate the error.

ERRORS
       The pthread_attr_setinheritsched() function shall fail if:

       ENOTSUP
              An attempt was made to  set  the  attribute  to  an  unsupported
              value.

       The pthread_attr_setinheritsched() function may fail if:

       EINVAL The value of inheritsched is not valid.

       These functions shall not return an error code of [EINTR].

       The following sections are informative.

EXAMPLES
       None.

APPLICATION USAGE
       After  these attributes have been set, a thread can be created with the
       specified attributes using pthread_create().  Using these routines does
       not affect the current running thread.

       See  Section  2.9.4,  Thread  Scheduling  for further details on thread
       scheduling attributes and their default settings.

RATIONALE
       If an implementation detects that the value specified by the attr argu‐
       ment   to   pthread_attr_getinheritsched()   or  pthread_attr_setinher‐
       itsched() does not refer to an initialized thread attributes object, it
       is recommended that the function should fail and report an [EINVAL] er‐
       ror.

FUTURE DIRECTIONS
       None.
