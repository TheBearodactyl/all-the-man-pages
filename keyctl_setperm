NAME
       keyctl_setperm - change the permissions mask on a key

SYNOPSIS
       #include <keyutils.h>

       long keyctl_setperm(key_serial_t key, key_perm_t perm);

DESCRIPTION
       keyctl_setperm() changes the permissions mask on a key.

       A process that does not have the SysAdmin capability may not change the permissions mask on a key that doesn't have the same UID as the caller.

       The caller must have setattr permission on a key to be able to change its permissions mask.

       The permissions mask is a bitwise-OR of the following flags:

       KEY_xxx_VIEW
              Grant permission to view the attributes of a key.

       KEY_xxx_READ
              Grant permission to read the payload of a key or to list a keyring.

       KEY_xxx_WRITE
              Grant permission to modify the payload of a key or to add or remove links to/from a keyring.

       KEY_xxx_SEARCH
              Grant permission to find a key or to search a keyring.

       KEY_xxx_LINK
              Grant permission to make links to a key.

       KEY_xxx_SETATTR
              Grant permission to change the ownership and permissions attributes of a key.

       KEY_xxx_ALL
              Grant all the above.

       The 'xxx' in the above should be replaced by one of:

       POS    Grant the permission to a process that possesses the key (has it attached searchably to one of the process's keyrings).

       USR    Grant the permission to a process with the same UID as the key.

       GRP    Grant the permission to a process with the same GID as the key, or with a match for the key's GID amongst that process's Groups list.

       OTH    Grant the permission to any other process.

       Examples include: KEY_POS_VIEW, KEY_USR_READ, KEY_GRP_SEARCH and KEY_OTH_ALL.

       User,  group  and  other grants are exclusive: if a process qualifies in the 'user' category, it will not qualify in the 'groups' category; and if a process qualifies in either 'user' or 'groups'
       then it will not qualify in the 'other' category.

       Possessor grants are cumulative with the grants from the 'user', 'groups' and 'other' categories.

RETURN VALUE
       On success keyctl_setperm() returns 0 .  On error, the value -1 will be returned and errno will have been set to an appropriate error.

ERRORS
       ENOKEY The specified key does not exist.

       EKEYEXPIRED
              The specified key has expired.

       EKEYREVOKED
              The specified key has been revoked.

       EACCES The named key exists, but does not grant setattr permission to the calling process.

LINKING
       This is a library function that can be found in libkeyutils.  When linking, -lkeyutils should be specified to the linker.
