NAME
       libssh2_session_block_directions - get directions to wait for

SYNOPSIS
       #include <libssh2.h>

       int libssh2_session_block_directions(LIBSSH2_SESSION *session);

DESCRIPTION
       session - Session instance as returned by libssh2_session_init_ex(3)

       When  any  of  libssh2 functions return LIBSSH2_ERROR_EAGAIN an application should wait for the socket to have data available for reading or writing. Depending on the return value of libssh2_ses‚Äê
       sion_block_directions(3) an application should wait for read, write or both.

RETURN VALUE
       Returns the set of directions as a binary mask. Can be a combination of:

       LIBSSH2_SESSION_BLOCK_INBOUND: Inbound direction blocked.

       LIBSSH2_SESSION_BLOCK_OUTBOUND: Outbound direction blocked.

       Application should wait for data to be available for socket prior to calling a libssh2 function again. If LIBSSH2_SESSION_BLOCK_INBOUND is set select should contain the session socket in  readfds
       set.  Correspondingly in case of LIBSSH2_SESSION_BLOCK_OUTBOUND writefds set should contain the socket.
