NAME
       gnutls_fingerprint - API function

SYNOPSIS
       #include <gnutls/gnutls.h>

       int gnutls_fingerprint(gnutls_digest_algorithm_t algo, const gnutls_datum_t * data, void * result, size_t * result_size);

ARGUMENTS
       gnutls_digest_algorithm_t algo
                   is a digest algorithm

       const gnutls_datum_t * data
                   is the data

       void * result
                   is the place where the result will be copied (may be null).

       size_t * result_size
                   should hold the size of the result. The actual size of the returned result will also be copied there.

DESCRIPTION
       This function will calculate a fingerprint (actually a hash), of the given data.  The result is not printable data.  You should convert it to hex, or to something else printable.

       This is the usual way to calculate a fingerprint of an X.509 DER encoded certificate.  Note however that the fingerprint of an OpenPGP certificate is not just a hash and cannot be calculated with
       this function.

RETURNS
       On success, GNUTLS_E_SUCCESS (0) is returned, otherwise an error code is returned.
