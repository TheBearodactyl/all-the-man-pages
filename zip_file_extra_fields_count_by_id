NAME
     zip_file_extra_fields_count, zip_file_extra_fields_count_by_id â€” count extra fields for file in zip

LIBRARY
     libzip (-lzip)

SYNOPSIS
     #include <zip.h>

     zip_int16_t
     zip_file_extra_fields_count(zip_t *archive, zip_uint64_t index, zip_flags_t flags);

     zip_int16_t
     zip_file_extra_fields_count_by_id(zip_t *archive, zip_uint64_t index, zip_uint16_t extra_field_id, zip_flags_t flags);

DESCRIPTION
     The zip_file_extra_fields_count() function counts the extra fields for the file at position index in the zip archive.

     The following flags are supported:

           ZIP_FL_CENTRAL    Count extra fields from the archive's central directory.

           ZIP_FL_LOCAL      Count extra fields from the local file headers.

           ZIP_FL_UNCHANGED  Count the original unchanged extra fields, ignoring any changes made.

     The zip_file_extra_fields_count_by_id() function counts the extra fields with ID (two-byte signature) extra_field_id.  The other arguments are the same as for zip_file_extra_fields_count().

     Extra fields that are the same in the central directory and the local file header are merged into one.  Therefore, the counts with ZIP_FL_CENTRAL and ZIP_FL_LOCAL do not need to add up to the same
     value as when given ZIP_FL_CENTRAL|ZIP_FL_LOCAL at the same time.

RETURN VALUES
     Upon successful completion, the requested number of extra fields is returned.  Otherwise, -1 is returned and the error code in archive is set to indicate the error.

ERRORS
     zip_file_extra_fields_count() and zip_file_extra_fields_count_by_id() fail if:

     [ZIP_ER_NOENT]     index is not a valid file index in archive.
