NAME
       update-smart-drivedb - update smartmontools drive database

SYNOPSIS
       update-smart-drivedb [OPTIONS] [DESTFILE]

DESCRIPTION
       [This man page is generated for the Linux version of smartmontools.  It does not contain info specific to other platforms.]

       update-smart-drivedb updates /usr/share/smartmontools/drivedb.h or DESTFILE from branches/RELEASE_7_3_DRIVEDB of smartmontools SVN repository.

       The tools used for downloading are either curl(1), wget(1), lynx(1), or svn(1).

       The downloaded file is verified with OpenPGP/GPG key ID 721042C5.  The public key block is included in the script.

       The old file is kept if the downloaded file is identical (ignoring the differences in Id string) otherwise it is moved to drivedb.h.old.

       [NEW  EXPERIMENTAL UPDATE-SMART-DRIVEDB FEATURE] The old file is also kept if the downloaded file reports an older version on the same branch.  This could be overridden with the '--force' option.
       If the branch version differs, the file is always updated.

OPTIONS
       -s SMARTCTL, --smartctl SMARTCTL
              Use the smartctl(8) executable at path SMARTCTL for drive database syntax check.  The form '-s -' disables the syntax check.  The default is /usr/bin/smartctl.

       -t [DIR/]TOOL, --tool [DIR/]TOOL
              Use TOOL for download.  TOOL is one of: curl wget lynx svn.  The default is the first one found in PATH.
              [NEW EXPERIMENTAL UPDATE-SMART-DRIVEDB FEATURE] A DIR could also be specified.  The plain TOOL name must then begin with any of the above names.

       -u LOCATION, --url-of LOCATION
              Use URL of LOCATION for download.  LOCATION is one of:
              github (GitHub mirror of SVN repository),
              sf (Sourceforge code browser),
              svn (SVN repository),
              svni (SVN repository via HTTP instead of HTTPS),
              trac (Trac code browser).
              The default is svn.

       --url URL
              [NEW EXPERIMENTAL UPDATE-SMART-DRIVEDB FEATURE] Download from URL.  A valid OpenPGP/GPG signature with '.raw.asc' extension must also exist unless '--no-verify' is also specified.

       --file FILE
              [NEW EXPERIMENTAL UPDATE-SMART-DRIVEDB FEATURE] Copy from local FILE.  A valid OpenPGP/GPG signature 'FILE.raw.asc' must also exist unless '--no-verify' is also specified.

       --trunk
              Download from SVN trunk.  This requires '--no-verify' because the trunk versions are not signed.

       --branch X.Y
              [NEW EXPERIMENTAL UPDATE-SMART-DRIVEDB FEATURE] Download from branches/RELEASE_X_Y_DRIVEDB.  This also selects the OpenPGP/GPG key for older branches (5.40 to 6.6: Key ID DFD22559).

       --cacert FILE
              Use CA certificates from FILE to verify the peer.

       --capath DIR
              Use CA certificate files from DIR to verify the peer.

       --insecure
              Don't abort download if certificate verification fails.  This option is also required if a HTTP URL is selected with '-u' option.

       --no-verify
              Don't verify signature with GnuPG.

       --force
              [NEW EXPERIMENTAL UPDATE-SMART-DRIVEDB FEATURE] Allow downgrades.  By default, the database is not replaced with an older version of the same branch.

       --export-key
              Print the OpenPGP/GPG public key block.

       --dryrun
              Print download commands only.

       -q, --quiet
              [NEW EXPERIMENTAL UPDATE-SMART-DRIVEDB FEATURE] Suppress info messages.

       -v, --verbose
              Verbose output.

       -h, --help
              Print help text.

       Download the database from SVN trunk to current directory:
