NAME
       FcConfigSetSysRoot - Set the system root directory

SYNOPSIS
       #include <fontconfig/fontconfig.h>

       void FcConfigSetSysRoot (FcConfig *config, const FcChar8 *sysroot);

DESCRIPTION
       Set  'sysroot'  as the system root directory. All file paths used or created with this 'config' (including file properties in patterns) will be considered or made relative to this 'sysroot'. This
       allows a host to generate caches for targets at build time. This also allows a cache to be re-targeted to a different base directory if 'FcConfigGetSysRoot' is used to resolve file  paths.   When
       setting this on the current config this causes changing current config (calls FcConfigSetCurrent()).
