NAME
       npm-config - Manage the npm configuration files

   Synopsis
         npm config set <key>=<value> [<key>=<value> ...]
         npm config get [<key> [<key> ...]]
         npm config delete <key> [<key> ...]
         npm config list [--json]
         npm config edit

         alias: c

       Note: This command is unaware of workspaces.

   Description
       npm gets its config settings from the command line, environment variables, npmrc files, and in some cases, the package.json file.

       See npm help npmrc for more information about the npmrc files.

       See npm help config(7) for a more thorough explanation of the mechanisms involved, and a full list of config options available.

       The npm config command can be used to update and edit the contents of the user and global npmrc files.

   Sub-commands
       Config supports the following sub-commands:

   set
         npm config set key=value [key=value...]
         npm set key=value [key=value...]

       Sets each of the config keys to the value provided.

       If value is omitted, then it sets it to an empty string.

       Note: for backwards compatibility, npm config set key value is supported as an alias for npm config set key=value.

   get
         npm config get [key ...]
         npm get [key ...]

       Echo the config value(s) to stdout.

       If multiple keys are provided, then the values will be prefixed with the key names.

       If no keys are provided, then this command behaves the same as npm config list.

   list
         npm config list

       Show all the config settings. Use -l to also show defaults. Use --json to show the settings in json format.

   delete
         npm config delete key [key ...]

       Deletes the specified keys from all configuration files.

   edit
         npm config edit

       Opens the config file in an editor.  Use the --global flag to edit the global config.

   Configuration
   json
       • Default: false

       • Type: Boolean

       Whether or not to output JSON data, rather than the normal output.

       • In npm pkg set it enables parsing set values with JSON.parse() before saving them to your package.json.

       Not supported by all npm commands.

   global
       • Default: false

       • Type: Boolean

       Operates in "global" mode, so that packages are installed into the prefix folder instead of the current working directory. See npm help folders for more on the differences in behavior.

       • packages are installed into the {prefix}/lib/node_modules folder, instead of the current working directory.

       • bin files are linked to {prefix}/bin

       • man pages are linked to {prefix}/share/man

   editor
       • Default: The EDITOR or VISUAL environment variables, or 'notepad.exe' on Windows, or 'vim' on Unix systems

       • Type: String

       The command to run for npm edit and npm config edit.

   location
       • Default: "user" unless --global is passed, which will also set this value to "global"

       • Type: "global", "user", or "project"

       When passed to npm config this refers to which config file to use.

       When set to "global" mode, packages are installed into the prefix folder instead of the current working directory. See npm help folders for more on the differences in behavior.

       • packages are installed into the {prefix}/lib/node_modules folder, instead of the current working directory.

       • bin files are linked to {prefix}/bin

       • man pages are linked to {prefix}/share/man

   long
       • Default: false

       • Type: Boolean
