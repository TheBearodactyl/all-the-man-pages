NAME
       CMS_add1_recipient, CMS_add1_recipient_cert, CMS_add0_recipient_key - add recipients to a CMS enveloped data structure

SYNOPSIS
        #include <openssl/cms.h>

        CMS_RecipientInfo *CMS_add1_recipient(CMS_ContentInfo *cms, X509 *recip,
                                              EVP_PKEY *originatorPrivKey,
                                              X509 *originator, unsigned int flags);

        CMS_RecipientInfo *CMS_add1_recipient_cert(CMS_ContentInfo *cms,
                                                   X509 *recip, unsigned int flags);

        CMS_RecipientInfo *CMS_add0_recipient_key(CMS_ContentInfo *cms, int nid,
                                                  unsigned char *key, size_t keylen,
                                                  unsigned char *id, size_t idlen,
                                                  ASN1_GENERALIZEDTIME *date,
                                                  ASN1_OBJECT *otherTypeId,
                                                  ASN1_TYPE *otherType);

DESCRIPTION
       CMS_add1_recipient() adds recipient recip and provides the originator pkey originatorPrivKey and originator certificate originator to CMS_ContentInfo.  The originator-related fields are relevant
       only in case when the keyAgreement method of providing of the shared key is in use.

       CMS_add1_recipient_cert() adds recipient recip to CMS_ContentInfo enveloped data structure cms as a KeyTransRecipientInfo structure.

       CMS_add0_recipient_key() adds symmetric key key of length keylen using wrapping algorithm nid, identifier id of length idlen and optional values date, otherTypeId and otherType to CMS_ContentInfo
       enveloped data structure cms as a KEKRecipientInfo structure.

       The CMS_ContentInfo structure should be obtained from an initial call to CMS_encrypt() with the flag CMS_PARTIAL set.

NOTES
       The main purpose of this function is to provide finer control over a CMS enveloped data structure where the simpler CMS_encrypt() function defaults are not appropriate. For example if one or more
       KEKRecipientInfo structures need to be added. New attributes can also be added using the returned CMS_RecipientInfo structure and the CMS attribute utility functions.

       OpenSSL will by default identify recipient certificates using issuer name and serial number. If CMS_USE_KEYID is set it will use the subject key identifier value instead. An error occurs if all
       recipient certificates do not have a subject key identifier extension.

       Currently only AES based key wrapping algorithms are supported for nid, specifically: NID_id_aes128_wrap, NID_id_aes192_wrap and NID_id_aes256_wrap.  If nid is set to NID_undef then an AES wrap
       algorithm will be used consistent with keylen.

RETURN VALUES
       CMS_add1_recipient_cert() and CMS_add0_recipient_key() return an internal pointer to the CMS_RecipientInfo structure just added or NULL if an error occurs.
