NAME
       PerlIO::via::QuotedPrint - PerlIO layer for quoted-printable strings

SYNOPSIS
           use PerlIO::via::QuotedPrint;

           open(my $in, '<:via(QuotedPrint)', 'file.qp') or
               die "Can't open file.qp for reading: $!\n";

           open(my $out, '>:via(QuotedPrint)', 'file.qp') or
               die "Can't open file.qp for writing: $!\n";

DESCRIPTION
       This module implements a PerlIO layer that works on files encoded in
       the quoted-printable format.  It will decode from quoted-printable
       while reading from a handle, and it will encode as quoted-printable
       while writing to a handle.
