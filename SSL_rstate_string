SSL_RSTATE_STRING(3ssl)             OpenSSL            SSL_RSTATE_STRING(3ssl)

NAME
       SSL_rstate_string, SSL_rstate_string_long - get textual description of
       state of an SSL object during read operation

SYNOPSIS
        #include <openssl/ssl.h>

        const char *SSL_rstate_string(SSL *ssl);
        const char *SSL_rstate_string_long(SSL *ssl);

DESCRIPTION
       SSL_rstate_string() returns a 2 letter string indicating the current
       read state of the SSL object ssl.

       SSL_rstate_string_long() returns a string indicating the current read
       state of the SSL object ssl.

NOTES
       When performing a read operation, the SSL/TLS engine must parse the
       record, consisting of header and body. When working in a blocking
       environment, SSL_rstate_string[_long]() should always return "RD"/"read
       done".

       This function should only seldom be needed in applications.

RETURN VALUES
       SSL_rstate_string() and SSL_rstate_string_long() can return the
       following values:

       "RH"/"read header"
           The header of the record is being evaluated.

       "RB"/"read body"
           The body of the record is being evaluated.

       "RD"/"read done"
           The record has been completely processed.

       "unknown"/"unknown"
           The read state is unknown. This should never happen.
