DESCRIPTION
       This program is used to control the key management facility in various ways using a variety of subcommands.

KEY IDENTIFIERS
       The key identifiers passed to or returned from keyctl are, in general, positive integers. There are, however, some special values with special meanings that can be passed as arguments:

       No key: 0

       Thread keyring: @t or -1
              Each thread may have its own keyring. This is searched first, before all others. The thread keyring is replaced by (v)fork, exec and clone.

       Process keyring: @p or -2
              Each  process  (thread  group)  may  have  its  own keyring. This is shared between all members of a group and will be searched after the thread keyring. The process keyring is replaced by
              (v)fork and exec.

       Session keyring: @s or -3
              Each process subscribes to a session keyring that is inherited across (v)fork, exec and clone. This is searched after the process keyring. Session keyrings  can  be  named  and  an  extant
              keyring can be joined in place of a process's current session keyring.

       User specific keyring: @u or -4
              This keyring is shared between all the processes owned by a particular user. It isn't searched directly, but is normally linked to from the session keyring.

       User default session keyring: @us or -5
              This is the default session keyring for a particular user. Login processes that change to a particular user will bind to this session until another session is set.

       Group specific keyring: @g or -6
              This is a place holder for a group specific keyring, but is not actually implemented yet in the kernel.

       Assumed request_key authorisation key: @a or -7
              This selects the authorisation key provided to the request_key() helper to permit it to access the callers keyrings and instantiate the target key.

       Keyring by name: %:<name>
              A named keyring.  This will be searched for in the process's keyrings and in /proc/keys.

       Key by name: %<type>:<name>
              A named key of the given type.  This will be searched for in the process's keyrings and in /proc/keys.

COMMAND SYNTAX
       Any  non-ambiguous  shortening of a command name may be used in lieu of the full command name. This facility should not be used in scripting as new commands may be added in future that then cause
       ambiguity.

   Display the package version number
       keyctl --version

       This command prints the package version number and build date and exits:

              $ keyctl --version
              keyctl from keyutils-1.5.3 (Built 2011-08-24)

   Query subsystem capabilities
       keyctl supports
       keyctl supports --raw
       keyctl supports <cap>

       This command can list the available capabilities:

              $ keyctl supports
              have_capabilities=0
              have_persistent_keyrings=1
              have_dh_compute=1
              have_public_key=1

       produce a raw hex dump of the capabilities list:

              $ keyctl supports --raw
              ff0f

       or query a specific capability:

              $ keyctl supports pkey
              echo $?
              0

       which exits 0 if the capability is supported, 1 if it isn't and 3 if the name is not recognised.  The capabilities supported are:

       capabilities
              The kernel supports capability querying.  If not, the other capabilities will be queried as best libkeyutils can manage.

       persistent_keyrings
              The kernel supports persistent keyrings.

       dh_compute
              The kernel supports Diffie-Hellman computation operations.

       public_key
              The kernel supports public key operations.

       big_key_type
              The kernel supports the big_key key type.

       key_invalidate
              The kernel supports the invalidate key operaiton.

       restrict_keyring
              The kernel supports the restrict_keyring operation.

       move_key
              The kernel supports the move key operation.

       ns_keyring_name
              Keyring names are segregated according to the user-namespace in which the keyrings are created.

       ns_key_tag
              Keys can get tagged with namespace tags, allowing keys with the same type and description, but different namespaces to coexist in the same keyring.  Tagging is done automatically according
              to the key type.

   Show actual key or keyring ID
       keyctl id [<key>]

       This  command  looks  up  the  real ID of a key or keyring from the identifier given, which is typically a symbolic ID such as "@s" indicating the session keyring, but can also be a numeric ID or
       "%type:desc" notation.  If a special keyring is specified that isn't created yet, an error will be given rather than causing that keyring to be created.

   Show process keyrings
       keyctl show [-x] [<keyring>]

       By default this command recursively shows what keyrings a process is subscribed to and what keys and keyrings they contain.  If a keyring is specified then that keyring will  be  dumped  instead.
       If -x is specified then the keyring IDs will be dumped in hex instead of decimal.

   Add a key to a keyring
       keyctl add [-x] <type> <desc> <data> <keyring>
       keyctl padd [-x] <type> <desc> <keyring>

       This command creates a key of the specified type and description; instantiates it with the given data and attaches it to the specified keyring. It then prints the new key's ID on stdout:

              $ keyctl add user mykey stuff @u
              26

       The padd variant of the command reads the data from stdin rather than taking it from the command line:

              $ echo -n stuff | keyctl padd user mykey @u 26

       If -x is given, then the data is hex-decoded with whitespace being discarded.

   Request a key
       keyctl request <type> <desc> [<dest_keyring>]
       keyctl request2 <type> <desc> <info> [<dest_keyring>]
       keyctl prequest2 <type> <desc> [<dest_keyring>]

       These  three commands request the lookup of a key of the given type and description. The process's keyrings will be searched, and if a match is found the matching key's ID will be printed to std‐
       out; and if a destination keyring is given, the key will be added to that keyring also.

       If there is no key, the first command will simply return the error ENOKEY and fail. The second and third commands will create a partial key  with  the  type  and  description,  and  call  out  to
       /sbin/request-key with that key and the extra information supplied. This will then attempt to instantiate the key in some manner, such that a valid key is obtained.

       The third command is like the second, except that the callout information is read from stdin rather than being passed on the command line.

       If a valid key is obtained, the ID will be printed and the key attached as if the original search had succeeded.

       If there wasn't a valid key obtained, a temporary negative key will be attached to the destination keyring if given and the error "Requested key not available" will be given.

              $ keyctl request2 user debug:hello wibble
              23
              $ echo -n wibble | keyctl prequest2 user debug:hello
              23
              $ keyctl request user debug:hello
              23

   Update a key
       keyctl update [-x] <key> <data>
       keyctl pupdate [-x] <key>

       This command replaces the data attached to a key with a new set of data. If the type of the key doesn't support update then error "Operation not supported" will be returned.

              $ keyctl update 23 zebra

       The pupdate variant of the command reads the data from stdin rather than taking it from the command line:

              $ echo -n zebra | keyctl pupdate 23
              $ echo 616263313233 | keyctl pupdate -x 23

       If -x is given, then the data is hex-decoded with whitespace being discarded.

   Create a keyring
       keyctl newring <name> <keyring>

       This command creates a new keyring of the specified name and attaches it to the specified keyring. The ID of the new keyring will be printed to stdout if successful.

              $ keyctl newring squelch @us
              27

   Revoke a key
       keyctl revoke <key>

       This command marks a key as being revoked. Any further operations on that key (apart from unlinking it) will return error "Key has been revoked".

              $ keyctl revoke 26
              $ keyctl describe 26
              keyctl_describe: Key has been revoked

   Clear a keyring
       keyctl clear <keyring>

       This command unlinks all the keys attached to the specified keyring. Error "Not a directory" will be returned if the key specified is not a keyring.

              $ keyctl clear 27

   Link a key to a keyring
       keyctl link <key> <keyring>

       This  command makes a link from the key to the keyring if there's enough capacity to do so. Error "Not a directory" will be returned if the destination is not a keyring. Error "Permission denied"
       will be returned if the key doesn't have link permission or the keyring doesn't have write permission. Error "File table overflow" will be returned if the keyring is full. Error  "Resource  dead‐
       lock avoided" will be returned if an attempt was made to introduce a recursive link.

              $ keyctl link 23 27
              $ keyctl link 27 27
              keyctl_link: Resource deadlock avoided

   Unlink a key from a keyring or the session keyring tree
       keyctl unlink <key> [<keyring>]

       If  the keyring is specified, this command removes a link to the key from the keyring. Error "Not a directory" will be returned if the destination is not a keyring. Error "Permission denied" will
       be returned if the keyring doesn't have write permission. Error "No such file or directory" will be returned if the key is not linked to by the keyring.

       If the keyring is not specified, this command performs a depth-first search of the session keyring tree and removes all the links to the nominated key that it finds (and that it is  permitted  to
       remove).  It prints the number of successful unlinks before exiting.

              $ keyctl unlink 23 27

   Move a key between keyrings.
       keyctl move  [-f] <key> <from_keyring> <to_keyring>

       This command moves a key from one keyring to another, atomically combining "keyctl unlink <key> <from_keyring>" and "keyctl link <key> <to_keyring>".

       If  the  "-f" flag is present, any matching key will be displaced from "to_keyring"; if not present, the command will fail with the error message "File exists" if the key would otherwise displace
       another key from "to_keyring".

              $ keyctl move 23 27 29
              $ keyctl move -f 71 @u @s

   Search a keyring
       keyctl search <keyring> <type> <desc> [<dest_keyring>]

       This command non-recursively searches a keyring for a key of a particular type and description. If found, the ID of the key will be printed on stdout and the key will be attached to the  destina‐
       tion keyring if present. Error "Requested key not available" will be returned if the key is not found.

              $ keyctl search @us user debug:hello
              23
              $ keyctl search @us user debug:bye
              keyctl_search: Requested key not available

   Restrict a keyring
       keyctl restrict_keyring <keyring> [<type> [<restriction>]]

       This  command limits the linkage of keys to the given keyring using a provided restriction scheme. The scheme is associated with a given key type, with further details provided in the restriction
       option string.  Options typically contain a restriction name possibly followed by key ids or other data relevant to the restriction. If no restriction scheme is provided, the keyring will  reject
       all links.

              $ keyctl restrict_keyring $1 asymmetric builtin_trusted

   Read a key
       keyctl read <key>
       keyctl pipe <key>
       keyctl print <key>

       These  commands read the payload of a key. "read" prints it on stdout as a hex dump, "pipe" dumps the raw data to stdout and "print" dumps it to stdout directly if it's entirely printable or as a
       hexdump preceded by ":hex:" if not.

       If the key type does not support reading of the payload, then error "Operation not supported" will be returned.

              $ keyctl read 26
              1 bytes of data in key:
              62
              $ keyctl print 26
              b
              $ keyctl pipe 26
              $

   List a keyring
       keyctl list <keyring>
       keyctl rlist <keyring>

       These commands list the contents of a key as a keyring. "list" pretty prints the contents and "rlist" just produces a space-separated list of key IDs.

       No attempt is made to check that the specified keyring is a keyring.

              $ keyctl list @us
              2 keys in keyring:
                     22: vrwsl----------  4043    -1 keyring: _uid.4043
                     23: vrwsl----------  4043  4043 user: debug:hello
              $ keyctl rlist @us
              22 23

   Describe a key
       keyctl describe <keyring>
       keyctl rdescribe <keyring> [sep]

       These commands fetch a description of a keyring. "describe" pretty prints the description in the same fashion as the "list" command; "rdescribe" prints the raw data returned from the kernel.

              $ keyctl describe @us
                     -5: vrwsl----------  4043    -1 keyring: _uid_ses.4043
              $ keyctl rdescribe @us
              keyring;4043;-1;3f1f0000;_uid_ses.4043

       The raw string is "<type>;<uid>;<gid>;<perms>;<description>", where uid and gid are the decimal user and group IDs, perms is the permissions mask in hex, type and description are  the  type  name
       and description strings (neither of which will contain semicolons).

   Change the access controls on a key
       keyctl chown <key> <uid>
       keyctl chgrp <key> <gid>

       These two commands change the UID and GID associated with evaluating a key's permissions mask. The UID also governs which quota a key is taken out of.

       The chown command is not currently supported; attempting it will earn the error "Operation not supported" at best.

       For non-superuser users, the GID may only be set to the process's GID or a GID in the process's groups list. The superuser may set any GID it likes.

              $ sudo keyctl chown 27 0
              keyctl_chown: Operation not supported
              $ sudo keyctl chgrp 27 0

   Set the permissions mask on a key
       keyctl setperm <key> <mask>

       This command changes the permission control mask on a key. The mask may be specified as a hex number if it begins "0x", an octal number if it begins "0" or a decimal number otherwise.

       The hex numbers are a combination of:

              Possessor UID       GID       Other     Permission Granted

       View permits the type, description and other parameters of a key to be viewed.

       Read permits the payload (or keyring list) to be read if supported by the type.

       Write permits the payload (or keyring list) to be modified or updated.

       Search on a key permits it to be found when a keyring to which it is linked is searched.

       Link permits a key to be linked to a keyring.

       Set Attribute permits a key to have its owner, group membership, permissions mask and timeout changed.

              $ keyctl setperm 27 0x1f1f1f00

   Start a new session with fresh keyrings
       keyctl session
       keyctl session - [<prog> <arg1> <arg2> ...]
       keyctl session <name> [<prog> <arg1> <arg2> ...]

       These commands join or create a new keyring and then run a shell or other program with that keyring as the session key.

       The variation with no arguments just creates an anonymous session keyring and attaches that as the session keyring; it then exec's $SHELL.

       The variation with a dash in place of a name creates an anonymous session keyring and attaches that as the session keyring; it then exec's the supplied command, or $SHELL if one isn't supplied.

       The variation with a name supplied creates or joins the named keyring and attaches that as the session keyring; it then exec's the supplied command, or $SHELL if one isn't supplied.

   Instantiate a key
       keyctl instantiate [-x] <key> <data> <keyring>
       keyctl pinstantiate [-x] <key> <keyring>
       keyctl negate <key> <timeout> <keyring>
       keyctl reject <key> <timeout> <error> <keyring>

       These commands are used to attach data to a partially set up key (as created by the kernel and passed to /sbin/request-key).  "instantiate" marks a key as being valid and attaches the data as the
       payload.  "negate" and "reject" mark a key as invalid and sets a timeout on it so that it'll go away after a while.  This prevents a lot of quickly sequential requests  from  slowing  the  system
       down  overmuch  when they all fail, as all subsequent requests will then fail with error "Requested key not found" (if negated) or the specified error (if rejected) until the negative key has ex‐
       pired.

       Reject's error argument can either be a UNIX error number or one of 'rejected', 'expired' or 'revoked'.

       The newly instantiated key will be attached to the specified keyring.

       These commands may only be run from the program run by request-key - a special authorisation key is set up by the kernel and attached to the request-key's session keyring. This special key is re‐
       voked once the key to which it refers has been instantiated one way or another.

              $ keyctl instantiate $1 "Debug $3" $4
              $ keyctl negate $1 30 $4
              $ keyctl reject $1 30 64 $4

       The pinstantiate variant of the command reads the data from stdin rather than taking it from the command line:

              $ echo -n "Debug $3" | keyctl pinstantiate $1 $4

       If -x is given, then the data is hex-decoded with whitespace being discarded:

              $ echo 01 02 03 04 | keyctl pinstantiate -x $1 $4

   Set the expiry time on a key
       keyctl timeout <key> <timeout>

       This command is used to set the timeout on a key, or clear an existing timeout if the value specified is zero. The timeout is given as a number of seconds into the future.

              $ keyctl timeout $1 45

   Retrieve a key's security context
       keyctl security <key>

       This command is used to retrieve a key's LSM security context.  The label is printed on stdout.

              $ keyctl security @s
              unconfined_u:unconfined_r:unconfined_t:s0-s0:c0.c1023

   Give the parent process a new session keyring
       keyctl new_session [<name>]

       This  command is used to give the invoking process (typically a shell) a new session keyring, discarding its old session keyring.  If a name is given, the keyring is given that name, otherwise it
       will be given a name of "_ses" and will not be manually joinable.

              $  keyctl session foo
              Joined session keyring: 723488146
              $  keyctl show
              Session Keyring
                     -3 --alswrv      0     0  keyring: foo
              $  keyctl new_session
              490511412
              $  keyctl show
              Session Keyring
                     -3 --alswrv      0     0  keyring: _ses

       Note that this affects the parent of the process that invokes the system call, and so may only affect processes with matching credentials.  Furthermore, the change does not take effect  till  the
       parent process next transitions from kernel space to user space - typically when the wait() system call returns.

   Remove dead keys from the session keyring tree
       keyctl reap

       This command performs a depth-first search of the caller's session keyring tree and attempts to unlink any key that it finds that is inaccessible due to expiry, revocation, rejection or negation.
       It does not attempt to remove live keys that are unavailable simply due to a lack of granted permission.

       A key that is designated reapable will only be removed from a keyring if the caller has Write permission on that keyring, and only keyrings that grant Search permission  to  the  caller  will  be
       searched.

       The  command  prints  the number of keys reaped before it exits.  If the -v flag is passed then the reaped keys are listed as they're being reaped, together with the success or failure of the un‐
       link.

   Remove matching keys from the session keyring tree
       keyctl purge <type>
       keyctl purge [-i] [-p] <type> <desc>
       keyctl purge -s <type> <desc>

       These commands perform a depth-first search to find matching keys in the caller's session keyring tree and attempts to unlink them.  The number of keys successfully unlinked  is  printed  at  the
       end.

       The keyrings must grant Read and View permission to the caller to be searched, and the keys to be removed must also grant View permission.  Keys can only be removed from keyrings that grant Write
       permission.

       The first variant purges all keys of the specified type.

       The second variant purges all keys of the specified type that also match the given description literally.  The -i flag allows a case-independent match and the -p flag allows a prefix match.

       The third variant purges all keys of the specified type and matching description using the key type's comparator in the kernel to match the description.  This permits the key type to match a  key
       with a variety of descriptions.

   Get persistent keyring
       keyctl get_persistent <keyring> [<uid>]

       This command gets the persistent keyring for either the current UID or the specified UID and attaches it to the nominated keyring.  The persistent keyring's ID will be printed on stdout.

       The kernel will create the keyring if it doesn't exist and every time this command is called, will reset the expiration timeout on the keyring to the value in:

              /proc/sys/kernel/keys/persistent_keyring_expiry

       (by default three days).  Should the timeout be reached, the persistent keyring will be removed and everything it pins can then be garbage collected.

       If a UID other than the process's real or effective UIDs is specified, then an error will be given if the process does not have the CAP_SETUID capability.

   Compute a Diffie-Hellman shared secret or public key
       keyctl dh_compute <private> <prime> <base>

       This command computes either a Diffie-Hellman shared secret or the public key corresponding to the provided private key using the payloads of three keys. The computation is:

              base ^ private (mod prime)

       The  three inputs must be user keys with read permission. If the provided base key contains the shared generator value, the public key will be computed.  If the provided base key contains the re‐
       mote public key value, the shared secret will be computed.

       The result is printed to stdout as a hex dump.

              $ keyctl dh_compute $1 $2 $3
              8 bytes of data in result:
              00010203 04050607

   Compute a Diffie-Hellman shared secret and derive key material
       keyctl dh_compute_kdf <private> <prime> <base> <output_length> <hash_type>

       This command computes a Diffie-Hellman shared secret and derives key material from the shared secret using a key derivation function (KDF).  The shared secret is derived as outlined above and  is
       input to the KDF using the specified hash type. The hash type must point to a hash name known to the kernel crypto API.

       The operation derives key material of the length specified by the caller.

       The operation is compliant to the specification of SP800-56A.

       The result is printed to stdout as hex dump.

   Compute a Diffie-Hellman shared secret and apply KDF with other input
       keyctl dh_compute_kdf_oi [-x] <private> <prime> <base> <output_length> <hash_type>

       This  command is identical to the command dh_compute_kdf to generate a Diffie-Hellman shared secret followed by a key derivation operation. This command allows the caller to provide the other in‐
       put data (OI data) compliant to SP800-56A via stdin.

       If -x is given, then the data passed to stdin is hex-decoded with whitespace being discarded.

   Perform public-key operations with an asymmetric key
       keyctl pkey_query <key> <pass> [k=v]*
       keyctl pkey_encrypt <key> <pass> <datafile> [k=v]* > <encfile>
       keyctl pkey_decrypt <key> <pass> <encfile> [k=v]* > <datafile>
       keyctl pkey_sign <key> <pass> <datafile> [k=v]* > <sigfile>
       keyctl pkey_verify <key> <pass> <datafile> <sigfile> [k=v]*

       These commands query an asymmetric key, encrypt data with it, decrypt the encrypted data, generate a signature over some data and verify that signature.  For encrypt, decrypt and  sign,  the  re‐
       sulting data is written to stdout; verify reads the data and the signature files and compares them.

       [!] NOTE that the data is of very limited capacity, with no more bits than the size of the key.  For signatures, the caller is expected to digest the actual data and pass in the result of the di‐
       gest as the datafile.  The name of the digest should be specified on the end of the command line as "hash=<name>".

       The key ID indicates the key to use; pass is a placeholder for future password provision and should be "0" for the moment; datafile is the unencrypted data to be encrypted, signed or to have  its
       signature checked; encfile is a file containing encrypted data; and sigfile is a file containing a signature.

       A list of parameters in "key[=val]" form can be included on the end of the command line.  These specify things like the digest algorithm used ("hash=<name>") or the encoding form ("enc=<type>").

              k=`keyctl padd asymmetric "" @s <key.pkcs8.der`
              keyctl pkey_query $k 0 enc=pkcs1 hash=sha256
              keyctl pkey_encrypt $k 0 foo.hash enc=pkcs1 >foo.enc
              keyctl pkey_decrypt $k 0 foo.enc enc=pkcs1 >foo.hash
              keyctl pkey_sign $k 0 foo.hash enc=pkcs1 hash=sha256 >foo.sig
              keyctl pkey_verify $k 0 foo.hash foo.sig enc=pkcs1 hash=sha256

       See asymmetric-key(7) for more information.

   Change notifications
       keyctl watch [-f<filters>] <key>
       keyctl watch_session [-f <filters>] [-n <name>] \
                       <notifylog> <gclog> <fd> <prog> [<arg1> <arg2> ...]  keyctl watch_add <fd> <key>
       keyctl watch_rm <fd> <key>

       The  watch command watches a single key, printing notifications to stdout until the key is destroyed.  Filters can be employed to cut down the events that will be delivered.  The filter string is
       a series of letters, each one of which enables a particular event subtype:

              i - The key has been instantiated
              p - The key has been updated
              l - A link has been added to a keyring
              n - A link has been removed from a keyring
              c - A keyring has been cleared
              r - A key has been revoked
              v - A key has been invalidated
              s - A key has had its attributes changed

       The output of the command looks like:

              <keyid> <event> [<aux>]

       Where keyid is the primary subject of the notification, op is the event and aux is the secondary key if there is one (such as link where the primary key is the keyring secondary key  is  the  key
       being linked in to it).  For example:

              255913279 link 340681059
              255913279 clr

       An additional notication is generated when a key being watched is garbage collected, e.g.:

              255913279 gc

       The watch_session command creates a new session keyring, with name name if given, watches it for notifications and runs program prog with it.  The program is given the specified arguments.

       A  second  process  is  forked off to monitor the notifications.  The output from that is directed to the files notifylog for most notifications and gclog for key removal notifications (which are
       asynchronous and may be deferred).

       The watch_queue(7) device is exported to the program attached to fd number fd.  This can be passed by the other two commands.

       The watch_add command adds a watch on key to the watch_queue attached to fd as exported by watch_session and the watch_rm caommand removes it.  A watch_queue can handle  multiple  keys  and  even
       non-keys sources as well.

ERRORS
       There are a number of common errors returned by this program:

       "Not a directory" - a key wasn't a keyring.

       "Requested key not found" - the looked for key isn't available.

       "Key has been revoked" - a revoked key was accessed.

       "Key has expired" - an expired key was accessed.

       "Permission denied" - permission was denied by a UID/GID/mask combination.

NAME
       keyctl_*() - key management function wrappers

DESCRIPTION
       The keyctl() system call is a multiplexor for a number of key management functions.  These should be called via the wrappers in the libkeyutils library.

       The functions can be compiled in by including the keyutils header file:

              #include <keyutils.h>

       and then telling the linker it should link in the library:

              -lkeyutils

NAME
       keyctl - manipulate the kernel's key management facility

LIBRARY
       Standard C library (libc, -lc)

       Alternatively, Linux Key Management Utilities (libkeyutils, -lkeyutils); see VERSIONS.

SYNOPSIS
       #include <linux/keyctl.h>     /* Definition of KEY* constants */
       #include <sys/syscall.h>      /* Definition of SYS_* constants */
       #include <unistd.h>

       long syscall(SYS_keyctl, int operation, unsigned long arg2,
                    unsigned long arg3, unsigned long arg4,
                    unsigned long arg5);

       Note: glibc provides no wrapper for keyctl(), necessitating the use of syscall(2).

DESCRIPTION
       keyctl() allows user-space programs to perform key manipulation.

       The  operation  performed by keyctl() is determined by the value of the operation argument.  Each of these operations is wrapped by the libkeyutils library (provided by the keyutils package) into
       individual functions (noted below) to permit the compiler to check types.

       The permitted values for operation are:

       KEYCTL_GET_KEYRING_ID (since Linux 2.6.10)
              Map a special key ID to a real key ID for this process.

              This operation looks up the special key whose ID is provided in arg2 (cast to key_serial_t).  If the special key is found, the ID of the corresponding real key is returned as the  function
              result.  The following values may be specified in arg2:

              KEY_SPEC_THREAD_KEYRING
                     This specifies the calling thread's thread-specific keyring.  See thread-keyring(7).

              KEY_SPEC_PROCESS_KEYRING
                     This specifies the caller's process-specific keyring.  See process-keyring(7).

              KEY_SPEC_SESSION_KEYRING
                     This specifies the caller's session-specific keyring.  See session-keyring(7).

              KEY_SPEC_USER_KEYRING
                     This specifies the caller's UID-specific keyring.  See user-keyring(7).

              KEY_SPEC_USER_SESSION_KEYRING
                     This specifies the caller's UID-session keyring.  See user-session-keyring(7).

              KEY_SPEC_REQKEY_AUTH_KEY (since Linux 2.6.16)
                     This  specifies  the authorization key created by request_key(2) and passed to the process it spawns to generate a key.  This key is available only in a request-key(8)-style program
                     that was passed an authorization key by the kernel and ceases to be available once the requested key has been instantiated; see request_key(2).

              KEY_SPEC_REQUESTOR_KEYRING (since Linux 2.6.29)
                     This specifies the key ID for the request_key(2) destination keyring.  This keyring is available only in a request-key(8)-style program that was passed an authorization key  by  the
                     kernel and ceases to be available once the requested key has been instantiated; see request_key(2).

              The behavior if the key specified in arg2 does not exist depends on the value of arg3 (cast to int).  If arg3 contains a nonzero value, then—if it is appropriate to do so (e.g., when look‐
              ing up the user, user-session, or session key)—a new key is created and its real key ID returned as the function result.  Otherwise, the operation fails with the error ENOKEY.

              If a valid key ID is specified in arg2, and the key exists, then this operation simply returns the key ID.  If the key does not exist, the call fails with error ENOKEY.

              The caller must have search permission on a keyring in order for it to be found.

              The arguments arg4 and arg5 are ignored.

              This operation is exposed by libkeyutils via the function keyctl_get_keyring_ID(3).

       KEYCTL_JOIN_SESSION_KEYRING (since Linux 2.6.10)
              Replace the session keyring this process subscribes to with a new session keyring.

              If arg2 is NULL, an anonymous keyring with the description "_ses" is created and the process is subscribed to that keyring as its session keyring, displacing the previous session keyring.

              Otherwise, arg2 (cast to char *) is treated as the description (name) of a keyring, and the behavior is as follows:

              •  If a keyring with a matching description exists, the process will attempt to subscribe to that keyring as its session keyring if possible; if that is not possible, an error is returned.
                 In order to subscribe to the keyring, the caller must have search permission on the keyring.

              •  If  a  keyring  with  a  matching  description does not exist, then a new keyring with the specified description is created, and the process is subscribed to that keyring as its session
                 keyring.

              The arguments arg3, arg4, and arg5 are ignored.

              This operation is exposed by libkeyutils via the function keyctl_join_session_keyring(3).

       KEYCTL_UPDATE (since Linux 2.6.10)
              Update a key's data payload.

              The arg2 argument (cast to key_serial_t) specifies the ID of the key to be updated.  The arg3 argument (cast to void *) points to the new payload and arg4 (cast to size_t) contains the new
              payload size in bytes.

              The caller must have write permission on the key specified and the key type must support updating.

              A negatively instantiated key (see the description of KEYCTL_REJECT) can be positively instantiated with this operation.

              The arg5 argument is ignored.

              This operation is exposed by libkeyutils via the function keyctl_update(3).

       KEYCTL_REVOKE (since Linux 2.6.10)
              Revoke  the key with the ID provided in arg2 (cast to key_serial_t).  The key is scheduled for garbage collection; it will no longer be findable, and will be unavailable for further opera‐
              tions.  Further attempts to use the key will fail with the error EKEYREVOKED.

              The caller must have write or setattr permission on the key.

              The arguments arg3, arg4, and arg5 are ignored.

              This operation is exposed by libkeyutils via the function keyctl_revoke(3).

       KEYCTL_CHOWN (since Linux 2.6.10)
              Change the ownership (user and group ID) of a key.

              The arg2 argument (cast to key_serial_t) contains the key ID.  The arg3 argument (cast to uid_t) contains the new user ID (or -1 in case the user ID shouldn't be changed).  The arg4  argu‐
              ment (cast to gid_t) contains the new group ID (or -1 in case the group ID shouldn't be changed).

              The key must grant the caller setattr permission.

              For the UID to be changed, or for the GID to be changed to a group the caller is not a member of, the caller must have the CAP_SYS_ADMIN capability (see capabilities(7)).

              If the UID is to be changed, the new user must have sufficient quota to accept the key.  The quota deduction will be removed from the old user to the new user should the UID be changed.

              The arg5 argument is ignored.

              This operation is exposed by libkeyutils via the function keyctl_chown(3).

       KEYCTL_SETPERM (since Linux 2.6.10)
              Change the permissions of the key with the ID provided in the arg2 argument (cast to key_serial_t) to the permissions provided in the arg3 argument (cast to key_perm_t).

              If the caller doesn't have the CAP_SYS_ADMIN capability, it can change permissions only for the keys it owns.  (More precisely: the caller's filesystem UID must match the UID of the key.)

              The key must grant setattr permission to the caller regardless of the caller's capabilities.

              The permissions in arg3 specify masks of available operations for each of the following user categories:

              possessor (since Linux 2.6.14)
                     This is the permission granted to a process that possesses the key (has it attached searchably to one of the process's keyrings); see keyrings(7).

              user   This is the permission granted to a process whose filesystem UID matches the UID of the key.

              group  This is the permission granted to a process whose filesystem GID or any of its supplementary GIDs matches the GID of the key.

              other  This is the permission granted to other processes that do not match the user and group categories.

              The user, group, and other categories are exclusive: if a process matches the user category, it will not receive permissions granted in the group category; if a process matches the user or
              group category, then it will not receive permissions granted in the other category.

              The possessor category grants permissions that are cumulative with the grants from the user, group, or other category.

              Each permission mask is eight bits in size, with only six bits currently used.  The available permissions are:

              view   This permission allows reading attributes of a key.

                     This permission is required for the KEYCTL_DESCRIBE operation.

                     The permission bits for each category are KEY_POS_VIEW, KEY_USR_VIEW, KEY_GRP_VIEW, and KEY_OTH_VIEW.

              read   This permission allows reading a key's payload.

                     This permission is required for the KEYCTL_READ operation.

                     The permission bits for each category are KEY_POS_READ, KEY_USR_READ, KEY_GRP_READ, and KEY_OTH_READ.

              write  This permission allows update or instantiation of a key's payload.  For a keyring, it allows keys to be linked and unlinked from the keyring,

                     This permission is required for the KEYCTL_UPDATE, KEYCTL_REVOKE, KEYCTL_CLEAR, KEYCTL_LINK, and KEYCTL_UNLINK operations.

                     The permission bits for each category are KEY_POS_WRITE, KEY_USR_WRITE, KEY_GRP_WRITE, and KEY_OTH_WRITE.

              search This permission allows keyrings to be searched and keys to be found.  Searches can recurse only into nested keyrings that have search permission set.

                     This permission is required for the KEYCTL_GET_KEYRING_ID, KEYCTL_JOIN_SESSION_KEYRING, KEYCTL_SEARCH, and KEYCTL_INVALIDATE operations.

                     The permission bits for each category are KEY_POS_SEARCH, KEY_USR_SEARCH, KEY_GRP_SEARCH, and KEY_OTH_SEARCH.

              link   This permission allows a key or keyring to be linked to.

                     This permission is required for the KEYCTL_LINK and KEYCTL_SESSION_TO_PARENT operations.

                     The permission bits for each category are KEY_POS_LINK, KEY_USR_LINK, KEY_GRP_LINK, and KEY_OTH_LINK.

              setattr (since Linux 2.6.15).
                     This permission allows a key's UID, GID, and permissions mask to be changed.

                     This permission is required for the KEYCTL_REVOKE, KEYCTL_CHOWN, and KEYCTL_SETPERM operations.

                     The permission bits for each category are KEY_POS_SETATTR, KEY_USR_SETATTR, KEY_GRP_SETATTR, and KEY_OTH_SETATTR.

              As a convenience, the following macros are defined as masks for all of the permission bits in each of the user categories: KEY_POS_ALL, KEY_USR_ALL, KEY_GRP_ALL, and KEY_OTH_ALL.

              The arg4 and arg5 arguments are ignored.

              This operation is exposed by libkeyutils via the function keyctl_setperm(3).

       KEYCTL_DESCRIBE (since Linux 2.6.10)
              Obtain a string describing the attributes of a specified key.

              The ID of the key to be described is specified in arg2 (cast to key_serial_t).  The descriptive string is returned in the buffer pointed to by arg3 (cast to char *); arg4 (cast to  size_t)
              specifies the size of that buffer in bytes.

              The key must grant the caller view permission.

              The returned string is null-terminated and contains the following information about the key:

                  type;uid;gid;perm;description

              In the above, type and description are strings, uid and gid are decimal strings, and perm is a hexadecimal permissions mask.  The descriptive string is written with the following format:

                  %s;%d;%d;%08x;%s

              Note: the intention is that the descriptive string should be extensible in future kernel versions.  In particular, the description field will not contain semicolons; it should be parsed by
              working backwards from the end of the string to find the last semicolon.  This allows future semicolon-delimited fields to be inserted in the descriptive string in the future.

              Writing to the buffer is attempted only when arg3 is non-NULL and the specified buffer size is large enough to accept the descriptive string (including the terminating null byte).  In  or‐
              der to determine whether the buffer size was too small, check to see if the return value of the operation is greater than arg4.

              The arg5 argument is ignored.

              This operation is exposed by libkeyutils via the function keyctl_describe(3).

       KEYCTL_CLEAR
              Clear the contents of (i.e., unlink all keys from) a keyring.

              The ID of the key (which must be of keyring type) is provided in arg2 (cast to key_serial_t).

              The caller must have write permission on the keyring.

              The arguments arg3, arg4, and arg5 are ignored.

              This operation is exposed by libkeyutils via the function keyctl_clear(3).

       KEYCTL_LINK (since Linux 2.6.10)
              Create a link from a keyring to a key.

              The key to be linked is specified in arg2 (cast to key_serial_t); the keyring is specified in arg3 (cast to key_serial_t).

              If a key with the same type and description is already linked in the keyring, then that key is displaced from the keyring.

              Before  creating  the  link,  the kernel checks the nesting of the keyrings and returns appropriate errors if the link would produce a cycle or if the nesting of keyrings would be too deep
              (The limit on the nesting of keyrings is determined by the kernel constant KEYRING_SEARCH_MAX_DEPTH, defined with the value 6, and is necessary to prevent overflows  on  the  kernel  stack
              when recursively searching keyrings).

              The caller must have link permission on the key being added and write permission on the keyring.

              The arguments arg4 and arg5 are ignored.

              This operation is exposed by libkeyutils via the function keyctl_link(3).

       KEYCTL_UNLINK (since Linux 2.6.10)
              Unlink a key from a keyring.

              The ID of the key to be unlinked is specified in arg2 (cast to key_serial_t); the ID of the keyring from which it is to be unlinked is specified in arg3 (cast to key_serial_t).

              If the key is not currently linked into the keyring, an error results.

              The caller must have write permission on the keyring from which the key is being removed.

              If the last link to a key is removed, then that key will be scheduled for destruction.

              The arguments arg4 and arg5 are ignored.

              This operation is exposed by libkeyutils via the function keyctl_unlink(3).

       KEYCTL_SEARCH (since Linux 2.6.10)
              Search for a key in a keyring tree, returning its ID and optionally linking it to a specified keyring.

              The tree to be searched is specified by passing the ID of the head keyring in arg2 (cast to key_serial_t).  The search is performed breadth-first and recursively.

              The arg3 and arg4 arguments specify the key to be searched for: arg3 (cast as char *) contains the key type (a null-terminated character string up to 32 bytes in size, including the termi‐
              nating null byte), and arg4 (cast as char *) contains the description of the key (a null-terminated character string up to 4096 bytes in size, including the terminating null byte).

              The source keyring must grant search permission to the caller.  When performing the recursive search, only keyrings that grant the caller search permission will  be  searched.   Only  keys
              with for which the caller has search permission can be found.

              If the key is found, its ID is returned as the function result.

              If  the key is found and arg5 (cast to key_serial_t) is nonzero, then, subject to the same constraints and rules as KEYCTL_LINK, the key is linked into the keyring whose ID is specified in
              arg5.  If the destination keyring specified in arg5 already contains a link to a key that has the same type and description, then that link will be displaced by a link to the key found  by
              this operation.

              Instead of valid existing keyring IDs, the source (arg2) and destination (arg5) keyrings can be one of the special keyring IDs listed under KEYCTL_GET_KEYRING_ID.

              This operation is exposed by libkeyutils via the function keyctl_search(3).

       KEYCTL_READ (since Linux 2.6.10)
              Read the payload data of a key.

              The  ID  of  the  key  whose  payload  is  to  be  read  is  specified  in  arg2  (cast  to  key_serial_t).  This can be the ID of an existing key, or any of the special key IDs listed for
              KEYCTL_GET_KEYRING_ID.

              The payload is placed in the buffer pointed by arg3 (cast to char *); the size of that buffer must be specified in arg4 (cast to size_t).

              The returned data will be processed for presentation according to the key type.  For example, a keyring will return an array of key_serial_t entries representing the IDs of  all  the  keys
              that are linked to it.  The user key type will return its data as is.  If a key type does not implement this function, the operation fails with the error EOPNOTSUPP.

              If  arg3  is not NULL, as much of the payload data as will fit is copied into the buffer.  On a successful return, the return value is always the total size of the payload data.  To deter‐
              mine whether the buffer was of sufficient size, check to see that the return value is less than or equal to the value supplied in arg4.

              The key must either grant the caller read permission, or grant the caller search permission when searched for from the process keyrings (i.e., the key is possessed).

              The arg5 argument is ignored.

              This operation is exposed by libkeyutils via the function keyctl_read(3).

       KEYCTL_INSTANTIATE (since Linux 2.6.10)
              (Positively) instantiate an uninstantiated key with a specified payload.

              The ID of the key to be instantiated is provided in arg2 (cast to key_serial_t).

              The key payload is specified in the buffer pointed to by arg3 (cast to void *); the size of that buffer is specified in arg4 (cast to size_t).

              The payload may be a NULL pointer and the buffer size may be 0 if this is supported by the key type (e.g., it is a keyring).

              The operation may be fail if the payload data is in the wrong format or is otherwise invalid.

              If arg5 (cast to key_serial_t) is nonzero, then, subject to the same constraints and rules as KEYCTL_LINK, the instantiated key is linked into the keyring whose ID specified in arg5.

              The caller must have the appropriate authorization key, and once the uninstantiated key has been instantiated, the authorization key is revoked.  In other words, this operation  is  avail‐
              able only from a request-key(8)-style program.  See request_key(2) for an explanation of uninstantiated keys and key instantiation.

              This operation is exposed by libkeyutils via the function keyctl_instantiate(3).

       KEYCTL_NEGATE (since Linux 2.6.10)
              Negatively instantiate an uninstantiated key.

              This operation is equivalent to the call:

                  keyctl(KEYCTL_REJECT, arg2, arg3, ENOKEY, arg4);

              The arg5 argument is ignored.

              This operation is exposed by libkeyutils via the function keyctl_negate(3).

       KEYCTL_SET_REQKEY_KEYRING (since Linux 2.6.13)
              Set  the default keyring to which implicitly requested keys will be linked for this thread, and return the previous setting.  Implicit key requests are those made by internal kernel compo‐
              nents, such as can occur when, for example, opening files on an AFS or NFS filesystem.  Setting the default keyring also has an effect when requesting  a  key  from  user  space;  see  re‐
              quest_key(2) for details.

              The arg2 argument (cast to int) should contain one of the following values, to specify the new default keyring:

              KEY_REQKEY_DEFL_NO_CHANGE
                     Don't change the default keyring.  This can be used to discover the current default keyring (without changing it).

              KEY_REQKEY_DEFL_DEFAULT
                     This  selects  the  default  behaviour,  which  is  to use the thread-specific keyring if there is one, otherwise the process-specific keyring if there is one, otherwise the session
                     keyring if there is one, otherwise the UID-specific session keyring, otherwise the user-specific keyring.

              KEY_REQKEY_DEFL_THREAD_KEYRING
                     Use the thread-specific keyring (thread-keyring(7)) as the new default keyring.

              KEY_REQKEY_DEFL_PROCESS_KEYRING
                     Use the process-specific keyring (process-keyring(7)) as the new default keyring.

              KEY_REQKEY_DEFL_SESSION_KEYRING
                     Use the session-specific keyring (session-keyring(7)) as the new default keyring.

              KEY_REQKEY_DEFL_USER_KEYRING
                     Use the UID-specific keyring (user-keyring(7)) as the new default keyring.

              KEY_REQKEY_DEFL_USER_SESSION_KEYRING
                     Use the UID-specific session keyring (user-session-keyring(7)) as the new default keyring.

              KEY_REQKEY_DEFL_REQUESTOR_KEYRING (since Linux 2.6.29)
                     Use the requestor keyring.

              All other values are invalid.

              The arguments arg3, arg4, and arg5 are ignored.

              The setting controlled by this operation is inherited by the child of fork(2) and preserved across execve(2).

              This operation is exposed by libkeyutils via the function keyctl_set_reqkey_keyring(3).

       KEYCTL_SET_TIMEOUT (since Linux 2.6.16)
              Set a timeout on a key.

              The ID of the key is specified in arg2 (cast to key_serial_t).  The timeout value, in seconds from the current time, is specified in arg3 (cast to unsigned int).  The timeout  is  measured
              against the realtime clock.

              Specifying the timeout value as 0 clears any existing timeout on the key.

              The /proc/keys file displays the remaining time until each key will expire.  (This is the only method of discovering the timeout on a key.)

              The caller must either have the setattr permission on the key or hold an instantiation authorization token for the key (see request_key(2)).

              The key and any links to the key will be automatically garbage collected after the timeout expires.  Subsequent attempts to access the key will then fail with the error EKEYEXPIRED.

              This operation cannot be used to set timeouts on revoked, expired, or negatively instantiated keys.

              The arguments arg4 and arg5 are ignored.

              This operation is exposed by libkeyutils via the function keyctl_set_timeout(3).

       KEYCTL_ASSUME_AUTHORITY (since Linux 2.6.16)
              Assume (or divest) the authority for the calling thread to instantiate a key.

              The arg2 argument (cast to key_serial_t) specifies either a nonzero key ID to assume authority, or the value 0 to divest authority.

              If  arg2  is nonzero, then it specifies the ID of an uninstantiated key for which authority is to be assumed.  That key can then be instantiated using one of KEYCTL_INSTANTIATE, KEYCTL_IN‐
              STANTIATE_IOV, KEYCTL_REJECT, or KEYCTL_NEGATE.  Once the key has been instantiated, the thread is automatically divested of authority to instantiate the key.

              Authority over a key can be assumed only if the calling thread has present in its keyrings the authorization key that is associated with the specified key.  (In other words, the KEYCTL_AS‐
              SUME_AUTHORITY  operation  is available only from a request-key(8)-style program; see request_key(2) for an explanation of how this operation is used.)  The caller must have search permis‐
              sion on the authorization key.

              If the specified key has a matching authorization key, then the ID of that key is returned.  The authorization key can be read (KEYCTL_READ) to obtain the callout information passed to re‐
              quest_key(2).

              If the ID given in arg2 is 0, then the currently assumed authority is cleared (divested), and the value 0 is returned.

              The KEYCTL_ASSUME_AUTHORITY mechanism allows a program such as request-key(8) to assume the necessary authority to instantiate a new uninstantiated key that was created as a consequence of
              a call to request_key(2).  For further information, see request_key(2) and the kernel source file Documentation/security/keys-request-key.txt.

              The arguments arg3, arg4, and arg5 are ignored.

              This operation is exposed by libkeyutils via the function keyctl_assume_authority(3).

       KEYCTL_GET_SECURITY (since Linux 2.6.26)
              Get the LSM (Linux Security Module) security label of the specified key.

              The ID of the key whose security label is to be fetched is specified in arg2 (cast to key_serial_t).  The security label (terminated by a null byte) will be placed in the buffer pointed to
              by arg3 argument (cast to char *); the size of the buffer must be provided in arg4 (cast to size_t).

              If arg3 is specified as NULL or the buffer size specified in arg4 is too small, the full size of the security label string (including the terminating null byte) is returned as the function
              result, and nothing is copied to the buffer.

              The caller must have view permission on the specified key.

              The returned security label string will be rendered in a form appropriate to the LSM in force.  For example, with SELinux, it may look like:

                  unconfined_u:unconfined_r:unconfined_t:s0-s0:c0.c1023

              If no LSM is currently in force, then an empty string is placed in the buffer.

              The arg5 argument is ignored.

              This operation is exposed by libkeyutils via the functions keyctl_get_security(3) and keyctl_get_security_alloc(3).

       KEYCTL_SESSION_TO_PARENT (since Linux 2.6.32)
              Replace the session keyring to which the parent of the calling process subscribes with the session keyring of the calling process.

              The keyring will be replaced in the parent process at the point where the parent next transitions from kernel space to user space.

              The keyring must exist and must grant the caller link permission.  The parent process must be single-threaded and have the same effective ownership as this process and  must  not  be  set-
              user-ID or set-group-ID.  The UID of the parent process's existing session keyring (f it has one), as well as the UID of the caller's session keyring much match the caller's effective UID.

              The fact that it is the parent process that is affected by this operation allows a program such as the shell to start a child process that uses this operation to change the shell's session
              keyring.  (This is what the keyctl(1) new_session command does.)

              The arguments arg2, arg3, arg4, and arg5 are ignored.

              This operation is exposed by libkeyutils via the function keyctl_session_to_parent(3).

       KEYCTL_REJECT (since Linux 2.6.39)
              Mark a key as negatively instantiated and set an expiration timer on the key.  This operation provides a superset of the functionality of the earlier KEYCTL_NEGATE operation.

              The ID of the key that is to be negatively instantiated is specified in arg2 (cast to key_serial_t).  The arg3 (cast to unsigned int) argument specifies the lifetime of the  key,  in  sec‐
              onds.  The arg4 argument (cast to unsigned int) specifies the error to be returned when a search hits this key; typically, this is one of EKEYREJECTED, EKEYREVOKED, or EKEYEXPIRED.

              If  arg5 (cast to key_serial_t) is nonzero, then, subject to the same constraints and rules as KEYCTL_LINK, the negatively instantiated key is linked into the keyring whose ID is specified
              in arg5.

              The caller must have the appropriate authorization key.  In other words, this operation is available only from a request-key(8)-style program.  See request_key(2).

              The caller must have the appropriate authorization key, and once the uninstantiated key has been instantiated, the authorization key is revoked.  In other words, this operation  is  avail‐
              able only from a request-key(8)-style program.  See request_key(2) for an explanation of uninstantiated keys and key instantiation.

              This operation is exposed by libkeyutils via the function keyctl_reject(3).

       KEYCTL_INSTANTIATE_IOV (since Linux 2.6.39)
              Instantiate an uninstantiated key with a payload specified via a vector of buffers.

              This operation is the same as KEYCTL_INSTANTIATE, but the payload data is specified as an array of iovec structures (see iovec(3type)).

              The pointer to the payload vector is specified in arg3 (cast as const struct iovec *).  The number of items in the vector is specified in arg4 (cast as unsigned int).

              The arg2 (key ID) and arg5 (keyring ID) are interpreted as for KEYCTL_INSTANTIATE.

              This operation is exposed by libkeyutils via the function keyctl_instantiate_iov(3).

       KEYCTL_INVALIDATE (since Linux 3.5)
              Mark a key as invalid.

              The ID of the key to be invalidated is specified in arg2 (cast to key_serial_t).

              To invalidate a key, the caller must have search permission on the key.

              This operation marks the key as invalid and schedules immediate garbage collection.  The garbage collector removes the invalidated key from all keyrings and deletes the key when its refer‐
              ence count reaches zero.  After this operation, the key will be ignored by all searches, even if it is not yet deleted.

              Keys that are marked invalid become invisible to normal key operations immediately, though they are still visible in /proc/keys (marked with an 'i' flag) until they are actually removed.

              The arguments arg3, arg4, and arg5 are ignored.

              This operation is exposed by libkeyutils via the function keyctl_invalidate(3).

       KEYCTL_GET_PERSISTENT (since Linux 3.13)
              Get the persistent keyring (persistent-keyring(7)) for a specified user and link it to a specified keyring.

              The user ID is specified in arg2 (cast to uid_t).  If the value -1 is specified, the caller's real user ID is used.  The ID of the destination keyring is specified in arg3 (cast to key_se‐
              rial_t).

              The  caller must have the CAP_SETUID capability in its user namespace in order to fetch the persistent keyring for a user ID that does not match either the real or effective user ID of the
              caller.

              If the call is successful, a link to the persistent keyring is added to the keyring whose ID was specified in arg3.

              The caller must have write permission on the keyring.

              The persistent keyring will be created by the kernel if it does not yet exist.

              Each time the KEYCTL_GET_PERSISTENT operation is performed, the persistent keyring will have its expiration timeout reset to the value in:

                  /proc/sys/kernel/keys/persistent_keyring_expiry

              Should the timeout be reached, the persistent keyring will be removed and everything it pins can then be garbage collected.

              Persistent keyrings were added in Linux 3.13.

              The arguments arg4 and arg5 are ignored.

              This operation is exposed by libkeyutils via the function keyctl_get_persistent(3).

       KEYCTL_DH_COMPUTE (since Linux 4.7)
              Compute a Diffie-Hellman shared secret or public key, optionally applying key derivation function (KDF) to the result.

              The arg2 argument is a pointer to a set of parameters containing serial numbers for three "user" keys used in the Diffie-Hellman calculation, packaged in a structure of the following form:

                  struct keyctl_dh_params {
                      int32_t private; /* The local private key */
                      int32_t prime; /* The prime, known to both parties */
                      int32_t base;  /* The base integer: either a shared
                                        generator or the remote public key */
                  };

              Each of the three keys specified in this structure must grant the caller read permission.  The payloads of these keys are used to calculate the Diffie-Hellman result as:

                  base ^ private mod prime

              If the base is the shared generator, the result is the local public key.  If the base is the remote public key, the result is the shared secret.

              The arg3 argument (cast to char *) points to a buffer where the result of the calculation is placed.  The size of that buffer is specified in arg4 (cast to size_t).

              The buffer must be large enough to accommodate the output data, otherwise an error is returned.  If arg4 is specified zero, in which case the buffer is not used and the  operation  returns
              the minimum required buffer size (i.e., the length of the prime).

              Diffie-Hellman  computations  can  be performed in user space, but require a multiple-precision integer (MPI) library.  Moving the implementation into the kernel gives access to the kernel
              MPI implementation, and allows access to secure or acceleration hardware.

              Adding support for DH computation to the keyctl() system call was considered a good fit due to the DH algorithm's use for deriving shared keys; it also allows the type of the key to deter‐
              mine which DH implementation (software or hardware) is appropriate.

              If the arg5 argument is NULL, then the DH result itself is returned.  Otherwise (since Linux 4.12), it is a pointer to a structure which specifies parameters of the KDF operation to be ap‐
              plied:

                  struct keyctl_kdf_params {
                      char *hashname;     /* Hash algorithm name */
                      char *otherinfo;    /* SP800-56A OtherInfo */
                      __u32 otherinfolen; /* Length of otherinfo data */
                      __u32 __spare[8];   /* Reserved */
                  };

              The hashname field is a null-terminated string which specifies a hash name (available in the kernel's crypto API; the list of the hashes available is rather tricky to observe; please refer
              to  the  "Kernel  Crypto  API Architecture" ⟨https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/crypto/architecture.html⟩ documentation for the information regarding how hash names are constructed and
              your kernel's source and configuration regarding what ciphers and templates with type CRYPTO_ALG_TYPE_SHASH are available) to be applied to DH result in KDF operation.

              The otherinfo field is an OtherInfo data as described in SP800-56A section 5.8.1.2 and is algorithm-specific.  This data is concatenated with the result of DH operation and is provided  as
              an input to the KDF operation.  Its size is provided in the otherinfolen field and is limited by KEYCTL_KDF_MAX_OI_LEN constant that defined in security/keys/internal.h to a value of 64.

              The __spare field is currently unused.  It was ignored until Linux 4.13 (but still should be user-addressable since it is copied to the kernel), and should contain zeros since Linux 4.13.

              The KDF implementation complies with SP800-56A as well as with SP800-108 (the counter KDF).

              This operation is exposed by libkeyutils (from libkeyutils 1.5.10 onwards) via the functions keyctl_dh_compute(3) and keyctl_dh_compute_alloc(3).

       KEYCTL_RESTRICT_KEYRING (since Linux 4.12)
              Apply  a  key-linking  restriction to the keyring with the ID provided in arg2 (cast to key_serial_t).  The caller must have setattr permission on the key.  If arg3 is NULL, any attempt to
              add a key to the keyring is blocked; otherwise it contains a pointer to a string with a key type name and arg4 contains a pointer to string that describes  the  type-specific  restriction.
              As of Linux 4.12, only the type "asymmetric" has restrictions defined:

              builtin_trusted
                     Allows only keys that are signed by a key linked to the built-in keyring (".builtin_trusted_keys").

              builtin_and_secondary_trusted
                     Allows  only  keys that are signed by a key linked to the secondary keyring (".secondary_trusted_keys") or, by extension, a key in a built-in keyring, as the latter is linked to the
                     former.

              key_or_keyring:key
              key_or_keyring:key:chain
                     If key specifies the ID of a key of type "asymmetric", then only keys that are signed by this key are allowed.

                     If key specifies the ID of a keyring, then only keys that are signed by a key linked to this keyring are allowed.

                     If ":chain" is specified, keys that are signed by a keys linked to the destination keyring (that is, the keyring with the ID specified in the arg2 argument) are also allowed.

              Note that a restriction can be configured only once for the specified keyring; once a restriction is set, it can't be overridden.

              The argument arg5 is ignored.

RETURN VALUE
       For a successful call, the return value depends on the operation:

       KEYCTL_ASSUME_AUTHORITY
              Either 0, if the ID given was 0, or the ID of the authorization key matching the specified key, if a nonzero key ID was provided.

       KEYCTL_GET_SECURITY
              The size of the LSM security label string (including the terminating null byte), irrespective of the provided buffer size.

       KEYCTL_GET_PERSISTENT

              The number of bytes copied to the buffer, or, if arg4 is 0, the required buffer size.

       All other operations
              Zero.

       On error, -1 is returned, and errno is set to indicate the error.

ERRORS
       EACCES The requested operation wasn't permitted.

       EAGAIN operation was KEYCTL_DH_COMPUTE and there was an error during crypto module initialization.

       EDEADLK
              operation was KEYCTL_LINK and the requested link would result in a cycle.

       EDEADLK
              operation was KEYCTL_RESTRICT_KEYRING and the requested keyring restriction would result in a cycle.

       EDQUOT The key quota for the caller's user would be exceeded by creating a key or linking it to the keyring.

       EEXIST operation was KEYCTL_RESTRICT_KEYRING and keyring provided in arg2 argument already has a restriction set.

       EFAULT operation was KEYCTL_DH_COMPUTE and one of the following has failed:

              •  copying of the struct keyctl_dh_params, provided in the arg2 argument, from user space;

              •  copying of the struct keyctl_kdf_params, provided in the non-NULL arg5 argument, from user space (in case kernel supports performing KDF operation on DH operation result);

              •  copying of data pointed by the hashname field of the struct keyctl_kdf_params from user space;

              •  copying of data pointed by the otherinfo field of the struct keyctl_kdf_params from user space if the otherinfolen field was nonzero;

              •  copying of the result to user space.

       EINVAL operation was KEYCTL_SETPERM and an invalid permission bit was specified in arg3.

       EINVAL operation was KEYCTL_SEARCH and the size of the description in arg4 (including the terminating null byte) exceeded 4096 bytes.

       EINVAL size of the string (including the terminating null byte) specified in arg3 (the key type) or arg4 (the key description) exceeded the limit (32 bytes and 4096 bytes respectively).

       EINVAL (before Linux 4.12)
              operation was KEYCTL_DH_COMPUTE, argument arg5 was non-NULL.

       EINVAL operation was KEYCTL_DH_COMPUTE And the digest size of the hashing algorithm supplied is zero.

       EINVAL operation was KEYCTL_DH_COMPUTE and the buffer size provided is not enough to hold the result.  Provide 0 as a buffer size in order to obtain the minimum buffer size.

       EINVAL operation was KEYCTL_DH_COMPUTE and the hash name provided in the hashname field of the struct keyctl_kdf_params pointed by arg5 argument is too big (the limit  is  implementation-specific
              and varies between kernel versions, but it is deemed big enough for all valid algorithm names).

       EINVAL operation was KEYCTL_DH_COMPUTE and the __spare field of the struct keyctl_kdf_params provided in the arg5 argument contains nonzero values.

       EKEYEXPIRED
              An expired key was found or specified.

       EKEYREJECTED
              A rejected key was found or specified.

       EKEYREVOKED
              A revoked key was found or specified.

       ELOOP  operation was KEYCTL_LINK and the requested link would cause the maximum nesting depth for keyrings to be exceeded.

       EMSGSIZE
              operation  was  KEYCTL_DH_COMPUTE  and the buffer length exceeds KEYCTL_KDF_MAX_OUTPUT_LEN (which is 1024 currently) or the otherinfolen field of the struct keyctl_kdf_parms passed in arg5
              exceeds KEYCTL_KDF_MAX_OI_LEN (which is 64 currently).

       ENFILE (before Linux 3.13)
              operation was KEYCTL_LINK and the keyring is full.  (Before Linux 3.13, the available space for storing keyring links was limited to a single page of memory; since Linux 3.13, there is  no
              fixed limit.)

       ENOENT operation was KEYCTL_UNLINK and the key to be unlinked isn't linked to the keyring.

       ENOENT operation was KEYCTL_DH_COMPUTE and the hashing algorithm specified in the hashname field of the struct keyctl_kdf_params pointed by arg5 argument hasn't been found.

       ENOENT operation was KEYCTL_RESTRICT_KEYRING and the type provided in arg3 argument doesn't support setting key linking restrictions.

       ENOKEY No matching key was found or an invalid key was specified.

       ENOKEY The value KEYCTL_GET_KEYRING_ID was specified in operation, the key specified in arg2 did not exist, and arg3 was zero (meaning don't create the key if it didn't exist).

       ENOMEM One of kernel memory allocation routines failed during the execution of the syscall.

       ENOTDIR
              A key of keyring type was expected but the ID of a key with a different type was provided.

       EOPNOTSUPP
              operation was KEYCTL_READ and the key type does not support reading (e.g., the type is "login").

       EOPNOTSUPP
              operation was KEYCTL_UPDATE and the key type does not support updating.

       EOPNOTSUPP
              operation  was  KEYCTL_RESTRICT_KEYRING,  the  type  provided in arg3 argument was "asymmetric", and the key specified in the restriction specification provided in arg4 has type other than
              "asymmetric" or "keyring".

       EPERM  operation was KEYCTL_GET_PERSISTENT, arg2 specified a UID other than the calling thread's real or effective UID, and the caller did not have the CAP_SETUID capability.

       EPERM  operation was KEYCTL_SESSION_TO_PARENT and either: all of the UIDs (GIDs) of the parent process do not match the effective UID (GID) of the calling process; the UID of the parent's  exist‐
              ing session keyring or the UID of the caller's session keyring did not match the effective UID of the caller; the parent process is not single-thread; or the parent process is init(1) or a
              kernel thread.

       ETIMEDOUT
              operation was KEYCTL_DH_COMPUTE and the initialization of crypto modules has timed out.

VERSIONS
       A wrapper is provided in the libkeyutils library.  (The accompanying package provides the <keyutils.h> header file.)  However, rather than using this system call directly, you  probably  want  to
       use the various library functions mentioned in the descriptions of individual operations above.

STANDARDS
       Linux.

HISTORY
       Linux 2.6.10.

EXAMPLES
       The program below provide subset of the functionality of the request-key(8) program provided by the keyutils package.  For informational purposes, the program records various information in a log
       file.

       As described in request_key(2), the request-key(8) program is invoked with command-line arguments that describe a key that is to be instantiated.  The example program fetches and logs these argu‐
       ments.  The program assumes authority to instantiate the requested key, and then instantiates that key.

       The  following  shell session demonstrates the use of this program.  In the session, we compile the program and then use it to temporarily replace the standard request-key(8) program.  (Note that
       temporarily disabling the standard request-key(8) program may not be safe on some systems.)  While our example program is installed, we use the example program shown in request_key(2) to  request
       a key.

           $ cc -o key_instantiate key_instantiate.c -lkeyutils
           $ sudo mv /sbin/request-key /sbin/request-key.backup
           $ sudo cp key_instantiate /sbin/request-key
           $ ./t_request_key user mykey somepayloaddata
           Key ID is 20d035bf
           $ sudo mv /sbin/request-key.backup /sbin/request-key

       Looking at the log file created by this program, we can see the command-line arguments supplied to our example program:

           $ cat /tmp/key_instantiate.log
           Time: Mon Nov  7 13:06:47 2016

           Command line arguments:
             argv[0]:            /sbin/request-key
             operation:          create
             key_to_instantiate: 20d035bf
             UID:                1000
             GID:                1000
             thread_keyring:     0
             process_keyring:    0
             session_keyring:    256e6a6

           Key description:      user;1000;1000;3f010000;mykey
           Auth key payload:     somepayloaddata
           Destination keyring:  256e6a6
           Auth key description: .request_key_auth;1000;1000;0b010000;20d035bf

       The last few lines of the above output show that the example program was able to fetch:

       •  the description of the key to be instantiated, which included the name of the key (mykey);

       •  the payload of the authorization key, which consisted of the data (somepayloaddata) passed to request_key(2);

       •  the destination keyring that was specified in the call to request_key(2); and

       •  the description of the authorization key, where we can see that the name of the authorization key matches the ID of the key that is to be instantiated (20d035bf).

       The example program in request_key(2) specified the destination keyring as KEY_SPEC_SESSION_KEYRING.  By examining the contents of /proc/keys, we can see that this was translated to the ID of the
       destination keyring (0256e6a6) shown in the log output above; we can also see the newly created key with the name mykey and ID 20d035bf.

           $ cat /proc/keys | egrep 'mykey|256e6a6'
           0256e6a6 I--Q---  194 perm 3f030000  1000  1000 keyring  _ses: 3
           20d035bf I--Q---    1 perm 3f010000  1000  1000 user     mykey: 16
