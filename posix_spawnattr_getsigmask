POSIX_SPAWNATTR_GETSIGMASK(POSIX Programmer's MaPOSIX_SPAWNATTR_GETSIGMASK(3P)

PROLOG
       This  manual  page is part of the POSIX Programmer's Manual.  The Linux
       implementation of this interface may differ (consult the  corresponding
       Linux  manual page for details of Linux behavior), or the interface may
       not be implemented on Linux.

NAME
       posix_spawnattr_getsigmask, posix_spawnattr_setsigmask —  get  and  set
       the  spawn-sigmask attribute of a spawn attributes object (ADVANCED RE‐
       ALTIME)

SYNOPSIS
       #include <signal.h>
       #include <spawn.h>

       int posix_spawnattr_getsigmask(const posix_spawnattr_t *restrict attr,
           sigset_t *restrict sigmask);
       int posix_spawnattr_setsigmask(posix_spawnattr_t *restrict attr,
           const sigset_t *restrict sigmask);

DESCRIPTION
       The posix_spawnattr_getsigmask() function shall obtain the value of the
       spawn-sigmask attribute from the attributes object referenced by attr.

       The  posix_spawnattr_setsigmask()  function shall set the spawn-sigmask
       attribute in an initialized attributes object referenced by attr.

       The spawn-sigmask attribute represents the signal mask in effect in the
       new  process  image  of a spawn operation (if POSIX_SPAWN_SETSIGMASK is
       set in the spawn-flags attribute). The default value of this  attribute
       is unspecified.

RETURN VALUE
       Upon  successful  completion, posix_spawnattr_getsigmask() shall return
       zero and store the value of the spawn-sigmask attribute  of  attr  into
       the  object  referenced  by  the sigmask parameter; otherwise, an error
       number shall be returned to indicate the error.

       Upon successful completion, posix_spawnattr_setsigmask()  shall  return
       zero;  otherwise, an error number shall be returned to indicate the er‐
       ror.

ERRORS
       These functions may fail if:

       EINVAL The value specified by attr is invalid.

       The posix_spawnattr_setsigmask() function may fail if:

       EINVAL The value of the attribute being set is not valid.

       The following sections are informative.

EXAMPLES
       None.

APPLICATION USAGE
       These functions are part of the Spawn option and need not  be  provided
       on all implementations.

RATIONALE
       None.

FUTURE DIRECTIONS
       None.
