NAME
       pactrans, pacinstall, pacremove - install/remove alpm packages

SYNOPSIS
        pactrans   [options] <target>...
        pacinstall [options] <target>...
        pacremove  [options] <target>...
        pactrans   (--help|--version)

DESCRIPTION
       Install/remove alpm packages.  The pacinstall and pacremove aliases are
       provided as a convenience, differing only in their default
       interpretation of targets.  Otherwise, they are identical.

       If stdin is not connected to a terminal, pkgspecs to install/remove
       will be read from stdin.

OPTIONS
   Operations
       Operation options affect the interpretation of all targets following
       them until another operation option is encountered.

       --spec (pactrans default)
           Interpret following targets as pkgspecs.  If a pkgspec indicates a
           package file or a repository package, it will be installed.  If it
           indicates a package in the local database, it will be removed.  See
           PKGSPEC for details on the format.

       --install (pacinstall default)
           Interpret following targets as packages to be installed from a
           repository.  If only the package name is provided repositories will
           be searched in the order they are declared.

       --remove (pacremove default)
           Interpret following targets as package names to be uninstalled.

       --file
           Interpret following targets as paths to package files to be
           installed.

       --sysupgrade
           Upgrade installed packages.

   Configuration Options
       --cache-dir=path
           Set an alternate cache directory path.

       --config=path
           Set an alternate configuration file path.

       --dbext=extension
           Set an alternate sync database extension.

       --dbpath=path
           Set an alternate database path.

       --logfile=path
           Set an alternate log file path.

       --root=path
           Set an alternate installation root.

       --sysroot=path
           Set an alternate system root.  See pacutils-sysroot(7).

       --null[=sep]
           Set an alternate separator for values parsed from stdin.  By
           default a newline "\n" is used as the separator.  If --null is used
           without specifying sep "NUL" will be used.

       --debug
           Display additional debugging information.

       --print-only

               one.

           "depends"

           Set the disposition for prompts to skip packages with unresolvable
           dependencies.

       --import-pgp-keys=prompt|yes|no

       NOTE: regardless of the disposition options chosen, all dependencies
       must still be satisfied in order for the transaction to succeed unless
       --nodeps is used as well.

PKGSPEC
       A pkgspec is a string that can identify an individual package.
       Accepted formats are:

       <repository>/<package>
            core/pacman
            local/pacman

       <proto>://<path/to/package/file>
            file:///var/cache/pacman/pkg/pacman-4.1.0-1-x86_64.pkg.tar.xz

EXAMPLES
       Replace foo with bar
            pactrans local/foo baz/bar

           Or, if bar's repository is unknown:

            pacinstall bar --remove foo

       Install foo and bar:
            pactrans --install foo bar

CAVEATS
       pactrans determines whether or not to read pkgspecs from stdin based on
       a naive check using isatty(3).  If pactrans is called in an
       environment, such as a shell function or script being used in a pipe,
       where stdin is not connected to a terminal but does not contain
       pkgspecs to install/remove, pactrans should be called with stdin
       closed.  For POSIX-compatible shells, this can be done with "<&-".
