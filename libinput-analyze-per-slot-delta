NAME
       libinput-analyze-per-slot-delta - analyze the per-event delta movement for touch slots

SYNOPSIS
       libinput analyze per-slot-delta [--help] [options] recording.yml

DESCRIPTION
       The libinput analyze per-slot-delta tool analyzes a recording made with libinput record and prints the delta movement per touch slot.

       This is a debugging tool only, its output may change at any time. Do not rely on the output.

OPTIONS
       --help  Print help

       --ignore-below=<units or mm>
               Ignore any movement below the given threshold. The threshold is in mm if --use-mm is selected or in device units otherwise.

       --threshold=<units or mm>
               Color any movement above this threshold in red. The threshold is in mm if --use-mm is selected or in device units otherwise.

       --use-mm
               Print data in mm instead of device units

       --use-st
               Use the single-touch ABS_X/ABS_Y instead of the multitouch axes

       --use-absolute
               Print absolute coordinates, not deltas

OUTPUT
       An example output for a single finger touch on a touchpad supporting two slots is below. This output is with the use of the --use-mm flag.

        0.000000   +0ms TOU:     ++++++     |  ************* |
        0.021900  +21ms TOU: →↘ +1.10/+0.14 |  ************* |
        0.033468  +11ms TOU: →↘ +1.15/+0.19 |  ************* |
        0.043856  +10ms TOU: →↘ +1.76/+0.22 |  ************* |
        0.053237   +9ms TOU: →↘ +2.20/+0.19 |  ************* |

       The  entry  ++++++  indicates  a finger has been put down, ------ indicates the finger has lifted.  The left-most column is the absolute timestamp in seconds.microseconds followed by the relative
       time of the event to the previous event.

       The word TOU in this example represents BTN_TOUCH, similar abbreviations exist for BTN_TOOL_DOUBLETAP, BTN_TOOL_TRIPLETAP, BTN_TOOL_QUADTAP, and BTN_TOOL_QUINTTAP.

       The arrows indicate the approximate direction on a 16-point compass, in this example EastSouthEast.

       Each multitouch slot supported by the hardware has one column, where the column shows asterisk ******** no finger is down for that slot. Where the column shows spaces only, a finger is  down  but
       no data is currently available.

       In  the above example, the third events occurs ~33ms into the recording, is 11ms after the previous event and has an east south-east direction. The movement for this event was x: 1.15 and y: 0.19
       mm. A second finger is not currently down.
