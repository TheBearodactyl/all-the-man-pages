DESCRIPTION
       Dissociate  the  FIPS  context  currently  active  on  the  current  thread,  reverting  to  the  previously  active  context. If a cryptographic operation is ongoing in the current thread, e.g.,

       This function is no-op if FIPS140 is not compiled in nor enabled at run-time.
