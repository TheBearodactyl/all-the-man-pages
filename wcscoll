PROLOG
       This  manual  page is part of the POSIX Programmer's Manual.  The Linux implementation of this interface may differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for details of Linux behavior), or
       the interface may not be implemented on Linux.

NAME
       wcscoll, wcscoll_l — wide-character string comparison using collating information

SYNOPSIS
       #include <wchar.h>

       int wcscoll(const wchar_t *ws1, const wchar_t *ws2);
       int wcscoll_l(const wchar_t *ws1, const wchar_t *ws2,
           locale_t locale);

DESCRIPTION
       For wcscoll(): The functionality described on this reference page is aligned with the ISO C standard. Any conflict between the requirements described here and the ISO C standard is unintentional.
       This volume of POSIX.1‐2017 defers to the ISO C standard.

       The wcscoll() and wcscoll_l() functions shall compare the wide-character string pointed to by ws1 to the wide-character string pointed to by ws2, both interpreted as appropriate to the LC_COLLATE
       category of the current locale, or the locale represented by locale, respectively.

       The wcscoll() and wcscoll_l() functions shall not change the setting of errno if successful.

       An application wishing to check for error situations should set errno to 0 before calling wcscoll() or wcscoll_l().  If errno is non-zero on return, an error has occurred.

       The behavior is undefined if the locale argument to wcscoll_l() is the special locale object LC_GLOBAL_LOCALE or is not a valid locale object handle.

RETURN VALUE
       Upon successful completion, wcscoll() and wcscoll_l() shall return an integer greater than, equal to, or less than 0, according to whether the wide-character string pointed to by ws1  is  greater
       than,  equal to, or less than the wide-character string pointed to by ws2, when both are interpreted as appropriate to the current locale, or to the locale represented by locale, respectively. On
       error, wcscoll() and wcscoll_l() shall set errno, but no return value is reserved to indicate an error.

ERRORS
       These functions may fail if:

       EINVAL The ws1 or ws2 arguments contain wide-character codes outside the domain of the collating sequence.

       The following sections are informative.

EXAMPLES
       None.

APPLICATION USAGE
       The wcsxfrm() and wcscmp() functions should be used for sorting large lists.

RATIONALE
       None.

FUTURE DIRECTIONS
       None.
