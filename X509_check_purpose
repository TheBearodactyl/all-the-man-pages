X509_CHECK_PURPOSE(3ssl)                                                                          OpenSSL                                                                         X509_CHECK_PURPOSE(3ssl)

NAME
       X509_check_purpose - Check the purpose of a certificate

SYNOPSIS
        #include <openssl/x509v3.h>

        int X509_check_purpose(X509 *x, int id, int ca);

DESCRIPTION
       This function checks if certificate x was created with the purpose represented by id. If ca is nonzero, then certificate x is checked to determine if it's a possible CA with various levels of
       certainty possibly returned. The certificate x must be a complete certificate otherwise the function returns an error.

       Below are the potential ID's that can be checked:

        # define X509_PURPOSE_SSL_CLIENT        1
        # define X509_PURPOSE_SSL_SERVER        2
        # define X509_PURPOSE_NS_SSL_SERVER     3
        # define X509_PURPOSE_SMIME_SIGN        4
        # define X509_PURPOSE_SMIME_ENCRYPT     5
        # define X509_PURPOSE_CRL_SIGN          6
        # define X509_PURPOSE_ANY               7
        # define X509_PURPOSE_OCSP_HELPER       8
        # define X509_PURPOSE_TIMESTAMP_SIGN    9

       The checks performed take into account the X.509 extensions keyUsage, extendedKeyUsage, and basicConstraints.

RETURN VALUES
       For non-CA checks

       -1 an error condition has occurred
        1 if the certificate was created to perform the purpose represented by id
        0 if the certificate was not created to perform the purpose represented by id

       For CA checks the below integers could be returned with the following meanings:

       -1 an error condition has occurred
        0 not a CA or does not have the purpose represented by id
        1 is a CA.
        2 Only possible in old versions of openSSL when basicConstraints are absent. New versions will not return this value. May be a CA
        3 basicConstraints absent but self signed V1.
        4 basicConstraints absent but keyUsage present and keyCertSign asserted.
        5 legacy Netscape specific CA Flags present
