NAME
       capng_print_caps_numeric - print numeric values for capabilities set

SYNOPSIS
       #include <cap-ng.h>

       char *capng_print_caps_numeric(capng_print_t where, capng_select_t set);

DESCRIPTION
       capng_print_caps_numeric  will  create  a  numeric  representation  of  the  internal  capabilities.  The  representation can be sent to either stdout or a buffer by passing CAPNG_PRINT_STDOUT or
       CAPNG_PRINT_BUFFER respectively for the where parameter. If the option was for a buffer, this function will malloc a buffer that the caller must free.

       The set parameter controls what is included in the representation. The legal options are CAPNG_SELECT_CAPS for the traditional capabilities, CAPNG_SELECT_BOUNDS for the  bounding  set,  CAPNG_SE‚Äê
       LECT_BOTH if printing both is desired, CAPNG_SELECT_AMBIENT if only printing the ambient capabilities, or CAPNG_SELECT_ALL if printing all is desired.

RETURN VALUE
       If CAPNG_PRINT_BUFFER was selected for where, this will be the text buffer and NULL on failure. If CAPNG_PRINT_STDOUT was selected then this value will be NULL no matter what.
