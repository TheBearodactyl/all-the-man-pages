NAME
       FcConfigSubstituteWithPat - Execute substitutions

SYNOPSIS
       #include <fontconfig/fontconfig.h>

       FcBool FcConfigSubstituteWithPat (FcConfig *config, FcPattern *p, FcPattern *p_pat, FcMatchKind kind);

DESCRIPTION
       Performs  the sequence of pattern modification operations, if kind is FcMatchPattern, then those tagged as pattern operations are applied, else if kind is FcMatchFont, those tagged as font opera‚Äê
       tions are applied and p_pat is used for <test> elements with target=pattern. Returns FcFalse if the substitution cannot be performed (due to allocation failure).  Otherwise  returns  FcTrue.   If
       config is NULL, the current configuration is used.
