NAME
       gnutls_credentials_set - API function

SYNOPSIS
       #include <gnutls/gnutls.h>

       int gnutls_credentials_set(gnutls_session_t session, gnutls_credentials_type_t type, void * cred);

ARGUMENTS
       gnutls_session_t session
                   is a gnutls_session_t type.

       gnutls_credentials_type_t type
                   is the type of the credentials

       void * cred the credentials to set

DESCRIPTION
       Sets  the  needed  credentials for the specified type.  E.g. username, password - or public and private keys etc.  The  cred parameter is a structure that depends on the specified type and on the
       current session (client or server).

       In order to minimize memory usage, and share credentials between several threads gnutls keeps a pointer to cred, and not the whole cred structure.  Thus you will have to keep the structure  allo‐
       cated until you call gnutls_deinit().

       For GNUTLS_CRD_ANON,  cred should be gnutls_anon_client_credentials_t in case of a client.  In case of a server it should be gnutls_anon_server_credentials_t.

       For GNUTLS_CRD_SRP,  cred should be gnutls_srp_client_credentials_t in case of a client, and gnutls_srp_server_credentials_t, in case of a server.

       For GNUTLS_CRD_CERTIFICATE,  cred should be gnutls_certificate_credentials_t.

RETURNS
       On success, GNUTLS_E_SUCCESS (0) is returned, otherwise a negative error code is returned.
