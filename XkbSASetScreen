NAME
       XkbSASetScreen - Sets the screenXXX field of act from s

SYNOPSIS
       void XkbSASetScreen (XkbSwitchScreenAction act, int s);

ARGUMENTS
       act    action in which to set screenXXX

       s      value to set in screenXXX

DESCRIPTION
       Actions associated with the XkbSwitchScreen action structure change the active screen on a multiscreen display.

       The type field of the XkbSwitchScreenAction structure should always be XkbSA_SwitchScreen.

       The flags field is composed of the bitwise inclusive OR of the masks shown in Table 1.

                       Table 1 Switch Screen Action Flags
       ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
       Flag                      Meaning
       ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
       XkbSA_SwitchAbsolute      If  set,  the screenXXX field represents
                                 the index of the new screen.  Otherwise,
                                 it represents an offset from the current
                                 screen to the new screen.
       XkbSA_SwitchApplication   If not set, the action should switch  to
                                 another screen on the same server.  Oth‐
                                 erwise, it should switch  to  another  X
                                 server  or  application  that shares the
                                 same physical display.

       The screenXXX field is a signed character value that represents either the relative or absolute screen index, depending on the state of the XkbSA_SwitchAbsolute bit in the flags field.  Xkb  pro‐
       vides the following macros to convert between the integer and signed character value for screen numbers in XkbSwitchScreenAction structures.

STRUCTURES
           typedef struct _XkbSwitchScreenAction {
               unsigned char    type;        /* XkbSA_SwitchScreen */
               unsigned char    flags;       /* controls screen switching */
               char             screenXXX;   /* screen number or delta */
           } XkbSwitchScreenAction;

NOTES
       This  action is optional. Servers are free to ignore the action or any of its flags if they do not support the requested behavior. If the action is ignored, it behaves like XkbSA_NoAction. Other‐
       wise, key press and key release events do not generate an event.
