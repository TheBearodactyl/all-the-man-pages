NAME
       xcb_key_press_event_t - a key was pressed/released

SYNOPSIS
       #include <xcb/xproto.h>

   Event datastructure
       typedef struct xcb_key_press_event_t {
           uint8_t         response_type;
           xcb_keycode_t   detail;
           uint16_t        sequence;
           xcb_timestamp_t time;
           xcb_window_t    root;
           xcb_window_t    event;
           xcb_window_t    child;
           int16_t         root_x;
           int16_t         root_y;
           int16_t         event_x;
           int16_t         event_y;
           uint16_t        state;
           uint8_t         same_screen;
           uint8_t         pad0;
       } xcb_key_press_event_t;

EVENT FIELDS
       response_type
                 The type of this event, in this case XCB_KEY_RELEASE. This field is also present in the xcb_generic_event_t and can be used to tell events apart from each other.

       sequence  The sequence number of the last request processed by the X11 server.

       detail    The keycode (a number representing a physical key on the keyboard) of the key which was pressed.

       time      Time when the event was generated (in milliseconds).

       root      The root window of child.

       event     NOT YET DOCUMENTED.

       child     NOT YET DOCUMENTED.

       root_x    The X coordinate of the pointer relative to the root window at the time of the event.

       root_y    The Y coordinate of the pointer relative to the root window at the time of the event.

       event_x   If same_screen is true, this is the X coordinate relative to the event window's origin. Otherwise, event_x will be set to zero.

       event_y   If same_screen is true, this is the Y coordinate relative to the event window's origin. Otherwise, event_y will be set to zero.

       state     The logical state of the pointer buttons and modifier keys just prior to the event.

       same_screen
                 Whether the event window is on the same screen as the root window.
