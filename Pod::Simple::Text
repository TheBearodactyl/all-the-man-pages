NAME
       Pod::Simple::Text -- format Pod as plaintext

SYNOPSIS
         perl -MPod::Simple::Text -e \

          thingy.pod

DESCRIPTION
       This class is a formatter that takes Pod and renders it as wrapped
       plaintext.

       Its wrapping is done by Text::Wrap, so you can change
       $Text::Wrap::columns as you like.

       This is a subclass of Pod::Simple and inherits all its methods.
